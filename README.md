# ðŸŽ® **Game-Insight: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis**

Discover what players love (or hate) about games! This project analyzes user reviews to identify game aspects (e.g., graphics, gameplay) and their associated sentiments using **NER** and **BERT**.

---

## ðŸš€ **Features**
- **Aspect Extraction**: Detects game aspects like *graphics*, *gameplay*, and *story*.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classifies sentiments as *Positive*, *Neutral*, or *Negative*.
- **Visual Insights**: Generates interactive charts and word clouds for trends.

---

## ðŸ”§ **How It Works**
1. **Scraping**: Collect user reviews from sources like forums, YouTube comments, and Reddit posts.
2. **BERT Fine-Tuning**: Train a BERT model on labeled sentiment data to classify user sentiments.
3. **Aspect Analysis**: Use NER and keyword matching to detect specific aspects (e.g., graphics, gameplay) in the comments.
4. **Visualization**: Generate bar charts, word clouds, and other visual insights to understand sentiment trends.
