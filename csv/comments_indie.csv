Return of the Obra Dinn,Incredible one of a kind game. Nothing like it
Return of the Obra Dinn,Superb review!
Return of the Obra Dinn,one of the best games I've ever played
Return of the Obra Dinn,its such a mindblowing game
Return of the Obra Dinn,Kudos to this guy for being a real enthusiast and knowing all his stuff.
Return of the Obra Dinn,Give me more Michael Swaim!
Return of the Obra Dinn,i thought the music was similar to papers please as I was watching the trailer lmao thats a surprise he made both
Return of the Obra Dinn,$19.99 for ps4 is just crazy to much
Return of the Obra Dinn,Loving the Cyberpunk graphics. It's a BUY from me!
Return of the Obra Dinn,I don’t understand how people like this game.
Return of the Obra Dinn,Thank you so much for a great narrative and content itself.
Return of the Obra Dinn,I already got a headache watching this review. It is not for me. Thanks.
Return of the Obra Dinn,why is this the most well spoken ign review i’ve ever seen
Return of the Obra Dinn,Loom wasn't 1-bit native. It was originally designed for 16-color EGA.
Return of the Obra Dinn,More Michael Swaim!!!!
Return of the Obra Dinn,"3:34

I can’t tell you how many times I was just walking through a memory and would be like

Hey Maba
Like I was talking to a friend
Before going about my business 

It has a weird potential for sympathy of these doomed souls"
Return of the Obra Dinn,This dude next game should be some weird SH flowers in the attic styled game but with less puzzlesolving.
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Such 
Wonder! 
An 
IGN 
Mvideo"
Return of the Obra Dinn,So many Michael Swaim supporters here 😃😃😃
Return of the Obra Dinn,So glad this game won two BAFTAs
Return of the Obra Dinn,how bout that Swaim
Return of the Obra Dinn,Ok FINE I'll actually buy the damn thing instead of letting it sit in my wishlist for another year.
Return of the Obra Dinn,"I'm deff gonna play this now, it looks awesome."
Return of the Obra Dinn,"*watches new Michael Swaim video*

*doesn’t laugh once, not because the jokes didn’t land, but because none were attempted*

IGN, what the hell are you doing? You don’t hire Picasso to just paint your fence regular old monotone white. I assume you brought Swaim onboard for his comic talent - why are you not using it? If this is what we have to look forward to, I’m even more bummed about Off Hours getting shelved for the foreseeable future."
Return of the Obra Dinn,Looks like phil burnell
Return of the Obra Dinn,It's more kinda like sad satan
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Why is there no *credits* on this video..?
Who's the Narrator? Who Wrote the script..? 
 
(Yes, you can find out it's Michael Swaim by reading the Comments, but still..)"
Return of the Obra Dinn,#SwaimTrain
Return of the Obra Dinn,SWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIM
Return of the Obra Dinn,Love you Michael Swaim
Return of the Obra Dinn,"GREAT game. everyone should give it a try,"
Return of the Obra Dinn,"If you decide to play this game, BE PREPARED TO TAKE NOTES! It's pretty much required unless you're planning on binging it and you have an incredible memory."
Return of the Obra Dinn,The escapist Game of the year.
Return of the Obra Dinn,Swaim! I'd recognize that voice anywhere. A reason to come back to IGN 😊🍻
Return of the Obra Dinn,Is the dude from cracked voice over-ing this video?
Return of the Obra Dinn,"This is the best game of 2018. I love it, I LOVE IT!"
Return of the Obra Dinn,Swaim!
Return of the Obra Dinn,Welcome Michael.
Return of the Obra Dinn,Yes! I can finally talk my console peasant friends into playing this great game!
Return of the Obra Dinn,OooOooOooOO
Return of the Obra Dinn,"I loved papers please and have been curious about this game. Great video, I'm going to have to give this one a try!"
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Seriously
Weird
And
Interesting 
Mechanics"
Return of the Obra Dinn,This game was so unique
Return of the Obra Dinn,"""...experience the transcendent, mundane joy of untying a logic knot, only to find an eerie, gripping, and very human story hiding inside."" <A summary of Swaim as well."
Return of the Obra Dinn,"I loved playing this on PC, definitely looking forward to the playing console version!
No matter what it’s an amazing game."
Return of the Obra Dinn,"hello mister swaim, glad you got the gig!"
Return of the Obra Dinn,"I have no idea what the point of this was, but it was all very entertaining."
Return of the Obra Dinn,"This looks like the video game version of the lighhouse, in style at least"
Return of the Obra Dinn,I'd heard of this but never seen any footage. Will definitely be buying it.
Return of the Obra Dinn,cracked nostalgia engage!
Return of the Obra Dinn,Yesss! Everyone get this game. It’s so much better than it looks! And it doesn’t look that bad!
Return of the Obra Dinn,Oh dayum Cracked Michael Swaim whaddup
Return of the Obra Dinn,Man this looks awesome
Return of the Obra Dinn,Interesting game I like it I will play it
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Who else loves IGN




I’m gifting my next 60 subscribers!!!"
Return of the Obra Dinn,Ah yes more games
Return of the Obra Dinn,Love this game! One of my favorites in 2018!
Return of the Obra Dinn,"So... to be clear, this game is called ""Return of the Obra Dinn"" not ""THE Return of the Obra Dinn,"" which is what I say multiple times during this video. Just got the name of the game I'm reviewing wrong. No biggie."
Return of the Obra Dinn,"I had heard really good things about this game. The art style is really cool too. Maybe I’m just dumb or something, but this game is brutally difficult and I find myself just getting frustrated when faces are no longer blurry, and I have absolutely no idea how I’m supposed to know who they are."
Return of the Obra Dinn,I've been watching playthroughs and reviews of this game for two weeks now and I immediately thought of my mother once I settled on an opinion. I just used your video to show her as a overview and she seems pretty convinced. Because of how I know she plays games the average person can beat this in 8 hours or so and it may take her triple that just because of her schedule which makes the $20 it goes for now so worth it. Some of the criticisms you had made her like it more so I'm doubly excited. Thank you for this video.
Return of the Obra Dinn,"So many interesting things happening in the gaming world right now (and this is 3 years old already? wow...) Seems like gaming (specially indie releases) is going through a renaisance right now 🙏 
I wonder what 3D rendering technique is that? And if someone ever explained how it works? Looks good"
Return of the Obra Dinn,"I agree that there are times where the style and graphics made it harder to see what's really happening. Pete took a long time in my list before I had him confirmed 😅
And George Shirley was my last one because you know 😂

I had the same reaction to the steam reviews. Like what the hell? Am I that bad? They're mostly 9+ hrs and I'm 15 hrs although to be fair my save game says just 12 hrs. I guess it doesn't count where you're paused? 😆

I love games that let's you discover things without explicitly guiding you and telling you what to do. Outer Wilds brought me to this game."
Return of the Obra Dinn,"You can't show 4:24 and then put ""no spoilers"" in your video title"
Return of the Obra Dinn,I just bought this 2 nights ago. I loved the 1 pixel 3D art. This truly is great gaming without lots of bling. It comes from great story telling and a mechanic no developer would ever dare try. Just did 15 fates and thinking o no...i better play this slow or else won't have this to play for long!
Return of the Obra Dinn,I gotta be honest Idk if I'm an idiot but I thought this game was real fucking tough.
Return of the Obra Dinn,I already got a headache watching this review. It is not for me. Thanks.
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Great game. A notes option for portraits and names would have been incredibly helpful though. For example the carpenter/carpenter's mate you mention, if you swap the carpenter to carpenter's mate it detaches the other fate from the drawing. So you have to remember yourself who the other face was and reassign carpenter to it. Would also be nice if you could flag your choices as certain/uncertain so you know which options are still open and which should not be changed. Technically you can get everything with 100% certainty by ruling out stuff in the correct order, but I don't think that's a common experience. Also one scene threw me off completely for a while, where you hear someone saying ""tell Pete's mom I did my best to pull him back"" and I thought Pete was the dying person, with the guy standing over him talking to the other seaman. The other person says ""tell her yourself"" which sounds like a dick thing to say to the guy bleeding to death but supposedly that's what it was."
Return of the Obra Dinn,I truly believe a lot of these artsy indie titles probably already came out on Commodore in the 80’s in some other dimension
Return of the Obra Dinn,Absolutely loved this game and it's without a doubt the best detective game I've ever played. Would love a sequel or something similar.
Return of the Obra Dinn,I loved it. Played for 6 hours straight and didnt wanna stop. Took 10 hrs total. Great game
Return of the Obra Dinn,Distinguishing between the Chinese topmen was tough. I don't know if there is a way to find out who is who accurately but I had to solve it by guessing.
Return of the Obra Dinn,"1:15

I kinda see that as the point though. Much like Papers Please, this is a bureaucratic adventure. 

You don’t investigate out of curiosity or quest for knowledge

You investigate because their are fines to be paid and pensions to be funded. 

A simple adventurer wouldn’t get connected to Evans, at least not with the same feeling of objectivity and neutrality.

Lastly, in Pope’s worlds, bureaucrats are the true heroes. When there are no adventurers willing to investigate a place, there will still be bureaucrats with an important job to do. One that should be praised."
Return of the Obra Dinn,The art is amazing but it's probably the biggest con of the game. Sometimes I just don't know how someone died because I have no clue what's happening.
Return of the Obra Dinn,"I was able to identify the first three people.  After that, I have no idea how to proceed."
Return of the Obra Dinn,Well structured review and concise use of language. Well done!
Return of the Obra Dinn,Isn't this a CSI?
Return of the Obra Dinn,Hello! I was just wondering if there is a lot of walking around in first person view in this game? I want to play it very badly but first person views make me so so so nauseous that I can't play them.. Thanks!
Return of the Obra Dinn,"> spoilers free
> shows a fucking kraken"
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Feel like I'll have to get this
I'M SO EXCITED!!!"
Return of the Obra Dinn,wow the next scp being made is looking REAL good
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Heh, semen."
Return of the Obra Dinn,ITS THE DARK SOULS OF DETECTIVE GAMES
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Really enjoyed your video and I want to try the game out because of it, but you should't have shown that tentacle.... I mean I was kinda expecting it, this being a ghost ship mystery and all, but little ambiguity still beats outright confirmation."
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Nice review! Will have to try it. 
There's no ""x"" in et cetera though. 
Sorry, it triggers me."
Return of the Obra Dinn,Great review!
Return of the Obra Dinn,"I love the game, recommended"
Return of the Obra Dinn,This is what I always wanted a game of thrones game to be like.
Return of the Obra Dinn,"There was me thinking everyone on yoochoob wore baseball hats and headphones, suffered from verbal diarrhoea, and laughed constantly at their own 'jokes'. Bravo! Bellissimo! Oh, and a nice game trying a bit too hard to be different and all black and whitey, but goes to show people who read books will always create absorbing experiences. Young landlubbers who find this game appealing because it's even more like a book might even try reading Jamaica Inn (warning, no moving pictures, muzak or folk calling you buttcrust bum-bandit while turning pages) and then some more books. Or any other daphne du maurier books for that matter."
Return of the Obra Dinn,"First, thank you for the good review.

Second, I 100% agree with your assessments. I just finished this game in 16h23m.
 As a non-native English speaker I have not used accents a single time. I
 have no idea what the difference between American, Wales, English, 
Scottish or Irish is. At least the Russian, Polish and Chinese were easy
 to identify because of the non-Latin characters.
I think I solved 
about 20 fates with a high degree of certainty, and about 40 with 
guessing. As you mentioned, with the brothers and with the Russians and 
Indians and Chinese. This is not good gameplay.

What you didn't mention were 2 things I found very annoying:
1. The walking speed is abysmally slow.
2. You cannot jump to a scene immediately. Combined with the tediously 
slooooooooooow walking speed this gets in the way of fun really quickly.

I would say this game is a flawed masterpiece, but a masterpiece nonetheless."
Return of the Obra Dinn,"I completed this game a few days back and absolutely loved it. More than any other game I wish I could go back and play it again for the first time. A second playthrough now, knowing what I know, seems to be defeating the point."
Return of the Obra Dinn,Finished in about 12 hours too without using guide. I have a feeling a lot of people got impatient with distinguishing causes of death and looked at guides. The game does need a couple of quality of life improvement.
Return of the Obra Dinn,Beautifully done review...you have me convinced;  Cheers! 🍻
Return of the Obra Dinn,It's so wonderful seeing indie game devs coming up with such unique games like this. Color me intrigued.
Return of the Obra Dinn,4:22 Definitely feels like a spoiler. Wish you wouldn't have added that.
Return of the Obra Dinn,"""Wow I can't believe John stabbed me the first mate of the ship right in the chest"" lol if only murders were that easy to solve"
Return of the Obra Dinn,sold on art direction alone
Return of the Obra Dinn,This reminds me a lot of paper sorcerer.
Return of the Obra Dinn,"This is legitimately one of the best games I have ever played. It really drew me in as soon as the first (or technically, the 'last') chapter was completed. As soon as I saw the beast in The Doom I was blown away. 

Such a great experience, I would recommend it to anyone."
Return of the Obra Dinn,"I loved this game. It's important to note that the game regularly confirms in batches of three if you're right about someone's fate. If you get three right, the game will tell you exactly which fates. Its kinda cheesy, but i used this mechanic to figure out several fates in the latter half of the game. 

There is one dude who plays a pivotal role in several scenes, but is never shown doing the job he has. He's shown in the crew sketches standing next to people involved in his job, but you don't know how significant that is at first since you'll often see people mingling in those pictures. The only way I figured him out is by inputting random names while knowing I had 2 other fates correct, so I knew the second I picked the correct name the game would confirm it. It kinda felt like cheating, but I did this multiple times, especially with the Chinese topmen who have very little dialogue. 

Also, I didn't take any notes while playing. I found everything easy to follow since if you select someone in your book you can get a map of the ship with every scene they're in clearly marked with arrows pointing out the order. This is especially useful for disappearances during the beast chapter."
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Oh jeez, it's out? Awesome, boy have I been looking forward to this one. Lucas Pope will impress again, I certainly hope."
Return of the Obra Dinn,"I'm at around 45 fates now. Man, this game is a masterpiece. I can't remember the last time I got so invested in a game."
Return of the Obra Dinn,"Damn, I love the art in this game. I feel like a dog looking at bacon;  just love at first sight."
Return of the Obra Dinn,Thanks for the spoiler-free video!
Outer Wilds,"There is no point in reviewing this game and everyone here knows this. Sure this is an accurate explanation, but it does not convey the feelings you get while playing. Just buy it and play it."
Outer Wilds,"Came back 3 years later to point out IGN rated CoD ghosts, the worst CoD and one of the most soulless games of all time, higher than this masterpiece. Kinda says something about your company when Polygon has more sense than you"
Outer Wilds,"JUST PLAY THE GAME AND DO NOT WATCH REVIEWS!!!!!!!
(trust this random comment)"
Outer Wilds,This is the new Myst
Outer Wilds,10/10
Outer Wilds,This is nothing but a masterpiece
Outer Wilds,Game is awesome but this review is terrible...
Outer Wilds,this game would of been better if it was co op
Outer Wilds,"For anyone that might be watching this now and is trying to get one of their friends to play it and is having a hard time convincing them, the best way is to just sit down with them and have 'em play next to you. Watching them play it and seeing their reactions will be even more rewarding for you."
Outer Wilds,“Read as much as you can” that’s me out. 😢
Outer Wilds,"Story, visuals, sound and the sense of dread while exploring is fantastic. That being said, the actual gameplay and controls are very mediocre, this combined with frustrating platforming/puzzles and time limit + timing requirement, makes the game a 6/10."
Outer Wilds,unimpressive
Outer Wilds,This got 8.4? How does this get that while death loop gets a 10 out of 10 when its 7/10 at best.
Outer Wilds,"Horror game graphic; don't understand why the newer the game is, the more anime, pixeled or cartooned graphic game becomes.
"
Outer Wilds,This review did not do even the sountrack to this game justice...very emotional game with a deeper message then what Ign realized
Outer Wilds,Why everyone praising this game!
Outer Wilds,This game is a hard 10. It's the best game of the decade.
Outer Wilds,This is the best game I’ve played in years.
Outer Wilds,The easiest 10/10 game ever for me
Outer Wilds,8.4 is literally why everyone at ign is a moron.
Outer Wilds,This game is life changing and to give it the same score as most Ubisoft games is a crime
Outer Wilds,IGN rating a bad call of duty game above a life changing masterpiece for the 50th time be like:
Outer Wilds,IGN is foul for giving this game a review this low. Insane
Outer Wilds,"Honestly People are seriously over rating this game. There not much to it, no real goals or anything. 6/10"
Outer Wilds,This game is a 10 hands down!!! It's a true masterpiece!
Outer Wilds,John 3:16
Outer Wilds,9.5*
Outer Wilds,Iiokioiij
Outer Wilds,this is literally a 10/10 wtf
Outer Wilds,The beginning sentence was what my problem with no man’s sky hopefully this game is better I’m buying it soon
Outer Wilds,Who knew no man's sky was missing majoras mask mechanics. One of the most intense gaming experiences of my life
Outer Wilds,People seem to love this game but it looks boring
Outer Wilds,This IGN reviewer had no idea what he was going on about. The game's a masterpiece.
Outer Wilds,"Just finished Outer Wilds - it's incredible. Not like any other game I've played before. Highly recommend you check it out and let yourself get immersed in it. 

And flying your spaceship is so much fun once you get the hang of it."
Outer Wilds,Damn
Outer Wilds,PSA: The PSN store has this on sale for $14.99 until 3/2 (at least in the US)!
Outer Wilds,"Cyberpunk got a 9. Think about that.......

The x/10 format is so unreliable and has no scale or significance lmao."
Outer Wilds,It’s like MYST in space.
Outer Wilds,"Imagine trying to read a really boring and badly written children's book, except every paragraph is printed on pages that are scattered all over the place and its up to you to find them and put them back in order. That's Outer Wilds."
Outer Wilds,Boring banjo campfire game.
Outer Wilds,Don't believe the Hype. This emperor has no clothes. Avoid at all costs.
Outer Wilds,2:45 the game literally does lmao
Outer Wilds,eh
Outer Wilds,"""Read as much as you can.""  PASS!"
Outer Wilds,Oh so just a big puzzle game with a larger backdrop under a space idea.  So basically nothing really to the game.
Outer Wilds,Once again ...IGN is NOT game experts. Absolute joke.
Outer Wilds,This game was awful.
Outer Wilds,"8.4?

You absolute clowns, this is why nobody takes gaming journalists seriously anymore! 😂😂 I’m guessing Daemon didn’t even finish the game."
Outer Wilds,just 8.4? that is way too low
Outer Wilds,This is a great game it’s weird tho with the head
Outer Wilds,Never thought I'd be annoyed for IGN giving too LOW of a score.
Outer Wilds,He forgot to mention how genuinely terrifying this game can be.
Outer Wilds,sounds boring as hell
Outer Wilds,This game deserves masterpiece 10/10
Outer Wilds,Exploration is the only reason I'm a gamer.
Outer Wilds,The most criminally underrated game I’ve ever played. Do yourself a favour and don’t watch any reviews or gameplay before playing the game. This review and the 8.4 score doesn’t do the game justice at all. A modern masterpiece in every sense of the word.
Outer Wilds,"I've had this game setting on the shelf for  2 months, still haven't played it."
Outer Wilds,This guy is a dipshit...
Outer Wilds,10/10 no debate
Outer Wilds,"Recently got to play this and Disco Elysium after missing them both in 2019, both very different games but two of the most original and enjoyable games I've ever played.  10/10 would recommend both!"
Outer Wilds,So annoying that reviews spoil the loop.
Outer Wilds,where is syndee. To guys should get fired
Outer Wilds,Why is there so many reviews saying it's the best game ever. Either this is true or these are fake comments
Outer Wilds,This was too spoilery of a review
Outer Wilds,I got anxiety just watching the reviews....somehow I want it
Outer Wilds,should be a 10/10
Outer Wilds,Try 9.4/10
Outer Wilds,Just started playing. Shocked to see its described as a puzzle game when I haven't even got as far as landing my jet pack without dying
Outer Wilds,👍👍👍
Outer Wilds,"Literally the best game ever, giving it an 8 is major disrespect"
Outer Wilds,I still can't believe fortnite got a higher score than outer wilds
Outer Wilds,Really like the game but the really frustrating movement with the shuttle and with the jetpack really kills the game for me and I'm probably not the only one who feels that way
Outer Wilds,lots of spoilers here
Outer Wilds,This is on sale for 14.99...me tinks me buy
Outer Wilds,"Really wanted to like this game, just didn’t."
Outer Wilds,How is this not a 10/10??
Outer Wilds,"Wow, I am glad I watched this, now I know this game is a hard pass. Thanks."
Outer Wilds,$4.99 at EPIC right now with the $10 coupon!
Outer Wilds,that review score was personally mediocre. to me it deserves at least a 10/10.
Outer Wilds,8.4?????? this game should get an 11/10 and is one of few masterpieces
Outer Wilds,Favourite game ever.
Outer Wilds,Looks boring
Outer Wilds,This is an absolute 10.
Outer Wilds,You gave this an 8 but The Witness a 10?
Outer Wilds,"Honestly, one thing I don't feel is mentioned like at all by all those praising this game is the awful controls that makes exploring this world grating more than anything. This is especially jarring given that some sections require hairline precision to get through, something the janky controls do not offer."
Outer Wilds,On sale today on steam.... thinking of picking it up to fill time while I wait for cyberpunk 2077. The majora's mask time loop concept was really cool.
Outer Wilds,I am 1 hour in and pretty cool game so far
Outer Wilds,Literally a game that shows you the sense of life should deserve atleast 10
Outer Wilds,Is this better than no mans sky?
Outer Wilds,"can only AAA titles get 10/10 or something ? outer wilds is perfection, what flaws?"
Outer Wilds,"I'm more of a Ps4 guy, but I used some of that covid layoff money to get a fire laptop and just beat Subnotica. Was going to do Below Zero or Grounded next, but.. Sold! Only $25 on Steam, is the cherry on top!"
Outer Wilds,"I'm a casual gamer. Started playing 3 days ago, I'm loving this game already!"
Outer Wilds,"Stop with the competitive things in gaming, return to form to single
Player intimate experiences that will go with you for ever"
Outer Wilds,Genuinely one of the best games I’ve ever played
Outer Wilds,"wow man, made my life...
nice one, subscribed...keep'em comin..."
Outer Wilds,"Great review. I got to know about the game because of my friend, who was impressed by its gameplay. To strike a balance between storytelling and open-world freedom is nearly impossible to do at times. Look at Zelda BotW and you'll see how it trades its story elements for its amazing open world. I believe they made the right choice, because for me, games are always more about gameplay, fun and innovation than story."
Outer Wilds,"For anyone here in 2020, I just bought the game, It captivated me straight away. this game is best enjoyed without looking at reviews!"
Outer Wilds,I see some clear inspiration from Elite Dangerous.
Outer Wilds,Can it run on intel graphics ?
Outer Wilds,"Now looking up solutions online is spun as a feature.  Wow, thanks IGN."
Outer Wilds,"if you're watching this when it was posted i'm streaming the game i promised to never play again on twitch: https://twitch.tv/shammyyt

Outer Wilds,Did you just pierce your tongue before recording this video?
Outer Wilds,Beautiful
Outer Wilds,I get the feeling this channel switched hosts at some point in the last 3 videos...
Outer Wilds,"I got trapped in a loop of “fuck I want to watch this video” and “damnit I respect her work too much to spoil something that she likes that much”

Fuck you and I can’t wait to watch this video after I play this game"
Outer Wilds,"I waited to watch the video, played the game for about an hour or 2, got surprised by the main thing about it's gameplay that was probably what Shammy was trying to hide, then watched this because I didn't know if I could bring myself to continue playing because I wasn't sure if it was my thing. Then the owl began giving me an existential breakdown and I became more demotivated to play it. I don't know if I can."
Outer Wilds,"You know, i can relate to this feeling of wanting to speak, to arrange the words into some meaning not for a viewer or a person on the other side but for yourself, to process the emotions and feels and ideas, putting them out there, while hoping to not sound archaic or dumb or depressed or anything else, because on the inside it feels hollow. You just bring it out for no apparent reason and it goes out there.

I kind of felt the same overwhelming joy and dread and panic and anxiety, when i watched bojack horseman. Its a show that brings the deepest of your anxieties out and yet it gives you time to breath… to process the thoughts and ideas, while smashing you back down with the reality of things, yet it the end it feels cathartic (maybe?). Like, it changes you and on the outside you look broken, tired, depressed, but on the inside you kind of know, that you were fragile, on the verge of breaking or falling apart, and it brought it all out, sure, but it gave you time to process and accept it. You are stronger now, in the long term.

The meaning of life is what we give it, yet if so, there is no meaning unless you specify it. But isnt it kind of cool on some weird messed up level? There is no clear goal, there is no need or definition, you are insignificant for sure, yet its a giant open field. And its all for you, an insignificant spec of meat and confused emotions to explore and enjoy. Its as much meaningless as it is opportunistic and it gives me meaning in some way.

Noone reads long messages on the internet, attention span isnt as high for folks. So once again its a medium for me to speak up, just like it was a funny owls on the internet medium to speak. Not of Outer wilds or of Bojack Horseman but of life itself or of the author of the message at hand. Explore yourself, get an understanding, and eventually you will feel comfortable.

P.S. try something simple for a change, overwhelming yourself can be tiresome. Bluey helps."
Outer Wilds,"I was fucking waiting for the god damn three eyed statue to come back around again at the end of the fucking video and I knew I K N E W that it would happen. Then as the prose fell away like the discarded aftermath of a rose becoming something new I thought: ""damn, she really didn't do the funny"". I got suckered into not expecting the statue only to get steel chaired by the fucking thing at the end. Because my prediction was wrong; it didn't matter. But no one even knew I made one, because it wasn't observed outside my head until I typed this. Shammy got my ass locked in the quantum stasis in perpetuity because I got zammo'd by a statue (that really should have had a ZA WARUDO sound effect)"
Outer Wilds,"Hey I posted 2 weeks ago, I'm getting a bot trying to get me to think I got a free gift. Just wanted to let someone know"
Outer Wilds,"i know this is probably a little bit late, but good luck on the expansion! its a different “level” of existentialism, but its still amazing :). this game affected me on the same plane as it has done to you, so im really glad you have made it through the existential crisis that comes with this amazing 19:22  headache of the favorite a game it is. anyway, i look forward to seeing ya again and make sure to enjoy the spook :)."

Outer Wilds,-ACK!
Outer Wilds,"I listened to your instructions and played it before finishing this review, very happy I did. My experience was the polar opposite, its themes left me happy, each occassion the game tried to bone me left me determined to keep swinging at it harder. It didnt leave me anxious in the face of inevitability, I felt liberated, the mirth I imagine everyone feels in their last breath knowing the pain is over. You're right, it has a different meaning to everyone but that meaning is always profound"
Outer Wilds,"I'm so glad you made this. You put to words an experience I lack learning and language to express. 

The part about the game was very good too."
Outer Wilds,"I legitimately paused the video when you said to go play it so as not to ruin it. 

And I just beat it. AND GOD DAMN am I so glad I listened to you."
Outer Wilds,"hey joy, just want you to know that when you run so far the sun becomes just a single point and you just sit and watch it get further and further away, we will always be here when you decide to turn on the thrusters and make your way back to us. we love you, I love you, and whether you’re a million kilometers away silently drifting, or you’re falling to pieces next to us,  we are proud of you, and we are proud of the work you have done. gonna see kiltro on the 22nd and ill be thinking of you and the vore"
Outer Wilds,I didn’t learn a thing about the game after 20 minutes of schizo rambling.
Outer Wilds,"thank you, your amazing in a way i only seem to understand the older i get"
Outer Wilds,"Clickbait ass title bruh, where is the game review?"
Outer Wilds,"If the game is TRULY that good then I doubt it could in any way be ruined just by knowing how it ends.

This is true for any piece of media."
Outer Wilds,"O) 
 —^| 
O)"
Outer Wilds,Voice change? It is cool but kinda curious what happened
Outer Wilds,What a peculiar creation :)
Outer Wilds,"I feel like I lost your thread a few times but I did my best to keep a grasp on it when I could. Outer Wilds is a deeply personal experience. Your experience doesn't seem to quite match my experience and while I can't really relate, I can empathize. I can imagine a world in which this game doesn't grip me and refuse to let me go. I can imagine a world where it takes weeks to push myself to get through this game I love for the way it frightens me. Which may not be the correct way of putting it but sometimes an incorrect word is the only one that is completely perfect. Outer Wilds is the best game of all time, but it's a game that forces you to face a certain reality. An uncomfortable reality. One that's easier for some to push aside in their head than for others. One in which nothing is permanent, not even yourself. Especially yourself. 

So. One thing has finally finished, but that's okay. There's still more to explore here. That's the important thing. Explore all you can while you can, even when you know the end is imminent. Or. Reflect. It's the end. Your questions may be left unanswered but that's okay, too. 

I don't want to spoil anything for the DLC but I'll risk saying this. Actions have consequences. Sometimes you'll never know what those consequences were. Other times your entire universe can be destroyed by a single individual who, because of your actions in the past, finds you, and makes you learn everything. That can be worse than knowing nothing, and it can free you for the rest of your life. Your only wish will be that such a person can possibly forgive you."
Outer Wilds,"This game is fuckin great, but Subnautica  is better 🙃"
Outer Wilds,Sir this is a Wendy's
Outer Wilds,you said you were gonna be embarrassed by this but wow this is beautiful because this is the most human thing anyone could make and its wonderful.
Outer Wilds,"Waow. Maybe you got a bit emotional about this review, though.
(Loved it)"
Outer Wilds,I don't think I've ever laughed that hard at a damn merch plug holy shit yo
Outer Wilds,"Outer Wilds videos are weird. For the first minute or so, it's a warning for people who haven't played it yet and to f*ck off. The rest of the video is for people who already played it and who basically already know whatever the video shows and says 😆"
Outer Wilds,Dude shammy why the fuck do you post vore on your twitter man what the fuck man
Outer Wilds,Fine. I’ll be back once I’ve played the game.
Outer Wilds,"I bought your new merch Joy and now I can sit in my room and contemplate the futility of my existence. I can now go out looking like a total dipshit and I couldn’t be happier. Never stop being you Joy. Or do, cause what does my opinion mean in this torture that we call life. Peace out girl scout 🥰"
Outer Wilds,Shamu has returned
Outer Wilds,"Hi owl girl, nice to see ya and your media takes and analysis

Also, trans rights, happy pride"
Outer Wilds,"For me, Peace was screaming into the void and then learning to laughing at the silence."
Outer Wilds,"Great video man.  Look forward to hearing about your experience in Echoes of the Eye!

Edit: Subscribed"
Outer Wilds,damn bro‼️‼️ me too tbh
Outer Wilds,"I say this with all variations of meaning intended:

You good my guy?"
Outer Wilds,Man it’s been awhile since I watched you shammy and ima have to get used to your new voice but I support you
Outer Wilds,"Fun fact: exactly 9,318,054 probe launches were attempted before finding The Eye, and each loop lasts 22 minutes, this means that the Hearthians (and the universe) were in a time loop for 389 years, 276 days, 21 hours, and 48 minutes before 1: the statue decided to wake up and do its job, or 2 and my previous favorite: that the traveler didn't look at the statue for 390 years."
Outer Wilds,"Best of luck to you on your journey through the DLC. The base game was the most profound existentialist experience of my life, and the DLC only made it that much better, despite how difficult it was on an emotional level to power through. It truly is something you can only experience for the first time once, but experiencing it at all is the important part. I'm looking forward to your review of it."
Outer Wilds,"Where’s my “I survived snooping in an ancient civilization’s Discord DMs and totally didn’t cry when I found their McGuffin” T - shirt?

Also fun fact I think Gabro is the only she/her fish peep in the game. All the other fish fuckers are gender neutral. Lil neat that"
Outer Wilds,Who are you and what did you do with Shammy
Outer Wilds,"Yep, he's right. Do it.

Edit: Oh! but if you have the DLC, (and you absolutely SHOULD have the DLC, it's phenomenal!) I would recommend starting it near the end of the main game. Before THE THING. You'll know when."
Outer Wilds,"My girlfriend was the one who hooked me to this game, we played it co-op and the ending absolutely broke me in a beautiful manner, many moments did in fact.

I thank her often for that experience when I'm reminded of it!"
Outer Wilds,Alright. I'll go play outer wild. Brb
Outer Wilds,"Absolutely based merch plug and fantastic video as always - Outer Wilds hit me HARD and I'm forever grateful to have run it blind, and I will say, the DLC is definitely worthwhile to get through as it feels like a completely natural addition to its universe. It's a brainbender that doesn't detract from the existing narrative, more serves to tell a story about another perspective of the events relative to the one you experience."
Outer Wilds,"I was not ready for this video... Thank you Shammy. This is the first time I feel like somebody conveyed emotion, mental state and though process so well as you did. 

If this improbable scenario of me, meeting you in person would happen... I don't know if I would know how to react but at the same time I know that it would be something i remember till the end. 

Even though we don't matter"
Outer Wilds,"i'm so glad you're still here and still writing, i love you and what you do so much !! :3 i'm gonna rewatch this video probably dozens of times like i've rewatched your other videos dozens of times because you make me feel so much less insane about the devastatingly opaque mechanisms of my greatest mortal enemy (the Brain). it's an actual physical sensation of ""oh my go,d she so gets me"" that stills the feral creature tearing up the walls of my skull for just a little while ,, 

so thanks. like actually!! thank you for sharing with us some of the multitudes you contain. i'm glad we got to be around at the same time ! <3<3"
Outer Wilds,waht are you even sayig
Outer Wilds,"Nihilism put into a game that acts like comfort food, great video, joy"
Outer Wilds,Holy fuck the DLC is gonna hit you like a train wreck
Outer Wilds,"Hey Shammy, thanks for the video. The game has made me think and feel similar things, but I think it’s ultimately comforting. 

Definitely play Echoes of the Eye. I wasn’t a fan of the gameplay, but the story/messages improved upon the base game. 

Also, the music is amazing in both base and Echoes. Prahlow did a great job"
Outer Wilds,You Will Never Be A Woman
Outer Wilds,your voice sounds different
Outer Wilds,"I’d love a StarCraft 2 review from you, also… BRICKYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!"
Outer Wilds,"_lol._  the 'interest'/watchtime 'spike' from 18:45 onwards

hey,  _""I am also visibly mentally ill_
_so I think it should go without saying that the game_
_very possibly will not have the same effect on you""_  
ohh, theres' a lot to unpack there & I'd crack wise about it... but  -  put simply  -  those barbs would be better levelled at myself  
*_`: \_*"
Outer Wilds,Welcome back! You voice is awesome!
Outer Wilds,The dlc probably hurt this man (if he finished it by now)
Outer Wilds,Yeah sounds pretty great but imma just keep playing the masterpiece that is Minecraft storymode
Outer Wilds,ineed to know the SONG!!!!!!!
Outer Wilds,"Please do a review of the expansion, you're the perfect person to do so."
Outer Wilds,Salute to you and your review sir. Absolutely on point. You strike me as a philosophy major. So was I. Bravo!
Outer Wilds,"Oh great. He lost his fucking mind and now he's taking pills and wearing a dress.

Please clap."
Outer Wilds,Whoa.
Outer Wilds,"Things might not matter, overall.
But games are fun. Play them.
Makes my happiness \o/"
Outer Wilds,Holy fuck bro I love you but like dam. This is some heavy shit coming from my favorite vore activist. 👍
Outer Wilds,The voice cracking and shifting towards the end kind of makes me un-ironically worry about you dude. Are you okay Shammy?
Outer Wilds,your outro music choice stays based and top tier. underbelly is such a good album
Outer Wilds,He fell off with this one 😂
Outer Wilds,"Played the game years ago and i can 100% understan how serious you are about spoilers. if there was ever a game the you shouln't get spoiled, it is this one. just go and play it you guys. seriously"
Outer Wilds,"18:07
""Words are feeble tools in the face of being."" Love that."
Outer Wilds,"On principle, its difficult to disagree with someone after they pour their heart out. Especially considering I've been in a similar place, that creeping feeling of crushing meaninglessness, or the dread of an end that's barely a breath away. But:

You matter. I matter. Value and meaning as concepts didn't exist before us, but we can *act,* and whether our actions have inherent value or meaning, we *will* leave behind an indisputable legacy; the people around us and the world as a whole will perpetuate only as a result of our choices. Sure, on a cosmic scale our decisions wont throw the planets out of alignment, but why is that important? The people around us and the world we're on matter, and every single one of us has the ability to affect it, to a far greater extent than I'm sure many realise.

One of the Hearthians put it best at the end of the game (and forgive me for paraphrasing): 'It's a shame that things end. But the results of our actions will remain, even when we're gone. What comes next is built on our choices, and the chance to contribute makes it all worth it'. That's what I think the true meaning is: our choices *do* matter, *we* matter. Perhaps not as individuals, but there is no future without our collective involvement. There is never a good reason to give up.

(Watch Everything Everywhere All at Once if you haven't already, its a masterpiece)

((Camus is a hack))"
Outer Wilds,"God, after hearing your old voice in that same tone for years its kind of strange to hear your new voice more setteld in. Like someone you know but dont but do. You feel me? Stranges shit."
Outer Wilds,"I am only half way through the video
Exactly 10 minutes infact
And I have been convinced to not watch the video until I play this game
Thank you for making that very clear. 
I will be sure to come back once I play the game. Which might be a while XD 

but as always
your writing, delivery and presentation of a game you are passionately reviewing. Is incredible <3
Thank you (^  ^)
see you again in..maybe a few months? XD Until I play the game that is"
Outer Wilds,Has Shammys voice changed or ist a new microphone?
Outer Wilds,omg your voice has changed so much it's so beautiful aspdoivnpobinwioefnponadiovnaoir absolutely slay queen
Outer Wilds,You've outdone yourself with this one Joy. So much emotion was trasmitted here and i love it! Thanks for your take on this one-of-a-kind game
Outer Wilds,"can anybody tell me why i should play this game without ruining the ""experience"" for me?"
Outer Wilds,yeah man this is the one actually.
Outer Wilds,"Last two years, after I played this game, I again and again found myself watching other people playthroughs. I still trying to figure out why.
Your reviews is not the answer, but the closest thing I ever had to one.
Thanks."
Outer Wilds,">Youtuber I somewhat enjoy uploads new video after 6 months
>didn’t watch last video it was about that stupid cat game
>voice is different
>sounds like a middle schooler going through puberty
>checks twitter 
>🏳️‍⚧️ 

MFW he tr00ned out 7 months ago."
Outer Wilds,Well a creator I haven't seen in 6month just up and told me to fuck off if I haven't played the game yet. I'll return to edit this comment once I actually do that
Outer Wilds,"As much as it *kills* me to deliberately not watch a new Shammy video, I always love and rewatch these so many times, I A. Don't feel like video games lately and B. Won't watch this until I play the game for myself. 

So I guess, I'll be back when the gaming itch comes back and I play Outer Wilds. Love you, Shammy."
Outer Wilds,"queen, thanks for the fantastic review fellow real one💕"
Outer Wilds,"Here is my problem with praising this game is that Its not for everyone. I have ADHD and derivering lore from text is extremely hard for me, my brain can't process the information trough text. Simply the act of trying to read long winded text and trying to also understand it is a real problem for many people and thats why i can't play text heavy games. 

The time limit is something i don't like at all. I just don't like time limits in games, never have. I wanna take my time and not stress. Some planets like the rising sand one i just cant deal with. That's how far i got before i quit the game. And if you die you have to go back and wait for the perfect moment again and if you miss that moment you have to do it all over again. It's not my cup of tea. 

Subjectively this is your 10/10 game but for me its a 4/10. And i will never play it again. I got half way trough it and that was it, i quit."
Outer Wilds,What I gathered is: Do not play this game unless you are mentally well.
Outer Wilds,apparently this week's challenge is 'reviewers don't say the r-slur: impossible'
Outer Wilds,we don't get to play it again - but i appreciate the content being made still. We still get to enjoy it. 10/10. Glad i wasn't the only fucking person crying like it was end of Kingdom Hearts again.
Outer Wilds,"So that explains why my one friend had a mental breakdown on their fourth life. The first two lives were the typical go around, try to learn how things work, oops I died. On their third life they tried to escape the star blowing up. When they got sucked back in and started life 4 they just... stopped. They flew into space with the ship, didn't do much of anything, then tried to flee again silently. I noticed her change in demeanor and asked if she was tired. All I could get out of her was a quiet and shaky ""I don't think I'm in the right mindset to be playing this game"" and closed it.

I was considering whether or not I should try to get her to pick it up again, but after seeing this I've decided not to push her. I never thought of anyone having their great awakening/reminder that we are just specs in this universe and nothing we do matters, but fucking hell, you poured your heart and soul out into this to get your feelings across, revision after revision. It HAS an impact to make, and you made me aware of that. I already had that revelation and mental collapse during my parents' divorce at 14. I got lost in the woods for 2 hours wondering what the fucking point of it all was. Why even try anything if dad is gonna throw it in my face as ""this better not be a new addiction"" or mom chaining me down with new rules and restrictions on what I can and can not do with MY computer (My family was not tech savvy at the time). I came to the conclusion after staring up at the trees for god-knows-how-long that only I have control on the outlook of my life, and I had the power to shape it into becoming what I wanted it to be. If I couldn't matter to my parents, I could at least matter to myself and my friends. I often forget how few people have been pushed to that breaking point of self-reflection on what living a life even is. (oh and for closure, dad never changed. Mom did and embraced computers after they split and sent me to college seeing my potential. I now do CADD stuff for a living so yey me).

if it offers any solace, we don't matter to ourselves if we believe that we don't matter, but we can't stop ourselves from mattering to everyone else. Look at how much we study the history of those before us. Spoilers: Hell, even in the game's lore the Naomi died 281,042 years prior to your adventure as a Hearthian. Even though the Naomi had been long gone, they mattered to the Hearthians. You are rather high-profile when it comes to being a reviewer of games as being the ""ha-ha silly owl"" person, so you do NOT have anything to worry about, girl. Take pride in that you matter to a lot of us. *You. Matter.*

For some self-reflection: one day I'll die, and I remember to be scared shitless for 30 minutes every 4 years about what will happen after that, but what scares me more is all the things I'd be missing out on while gone. I'd choose non-degrading immortality if given the chance, but it is what it is, and what it is is death and taxes. I'm gonna keep drawing, painting, building furniture, 3D designing and printing models, riding motorcycles, meeting people from other countries, and supporting other artists and craftsmen until the day I die. Flooding my brain with distractions galore suppresses the bad thoughts. I may have overdone it though as I'm fairly certain I have ADHD... but getting diagnosed and buying pills costs money. lmao. Given I'm 28 now and dying in the 50s range is common on my dad's side of the family thanks to hereditary heart disease, I'm halfway there already! Hooray!

I have a life, I am gonna live it, and I am going to die. That is that, and I will accept no less."
Outer Wilds,"I'm sad that shammy is gone and will never come back whole again if he continues this way.  Completely unhinged. Wish there was something I could do, honestly."
Outer Wilds,"Usually I learn something cool in Shammy videos, only thing I learned here is Shammy has some issues and need a therapist."
Outer Wilds,"I literally just finished Outer Wilds today. I got the game on your recommendation on seeing the beginning of this video. I thought you were goanna spoil the game rotten in this review but was surprised that you didn't talk spoilers at all. Not that I mind Outer Wilds was one of if not the best experiences I have ever had with a game and that was completely thanks to you.

Seriously I never gave this game a thought until this video dropped."
Outer Wilds,"There's a reason why cowboy bebop is my favorite anime of all time. You won't understand it until you understand the meaning of nothing. Explaining the value of worthlessness or yet the understanding of it, means you have my respect. Worthlessness humbles you and gives you empathy towards others. I too lack the words to express this, but I understand what you mean."
Celeste,You lost me at beautiful art...
Celeste,so Easy baby
Celeste,If a game deserved a ten thats one of them
Celeste,The only game for PS4 that looks like a Gameboy Color game that was nominated in Game of the Year!
Celeste,"Celeste - Best Platformer
Hollow Knight - Best Metroidvania
Dead Cells - Best Roguelike"
Celeste,This is by far one of my favorite games of all time
Celeste,Just finished it. Definitely worthy of the 10/10 score
Celeste,rare ign w
Celeste,Celste also have c sides and extra levels with c and b sides
Celeste,Is this game like guacamelee but harder?
Celeste,It’s on sale right now for $5 if anyone was thinking about it but wasn’t sold on getting it (me) so even if it’s difficult like some have said it’s $5 rn so worth a try! 😊 (75% off)
Celeste,IGN actually got it right for once...
Celeste,"Yet another misplaced 10. 10 means flawless and this game is terrific in many ways but the difficulty was over the top and inaccessible at times. Great level design, and lots of strawberries were fun and rewarding, but some were just frustrating and required more luck than skill. Gameplay is geared towards hardcore and persistent gamers but the story is universal, kind of a clash. I’d give it a 9 for the great music, characters, level design."
Celeste,"hey thanks, I'm almost done pirating the game and wanted to know what this game was all about"
Celeste,"celeste definitely deserves this score, but if celeste is a 10, how in hell is hollow knight a 9.4"
Celeste,So over-rated more like a 6
Celeste,Just beat the game. It was alright. Overrated imo
Celeste,A person that knows how to play a game reviewed celeste? *WOW*
Celeste,This game is crap and the reviewer is crap
Celeste,"Fun fact: Teo and Bad part are the only sane lifeforms in whole game, while Madeline, birb, granny, Oshiro, red slimes, shrine monsters, living blocks, pufferfishes, jellyfishes and mountain itself should be peeled and burned alive.
Edit: just remembered crystal struggling and boss fight at chapter 6, so everyone in this game is annoying"
Celeste,gotta love how half of the comments are all le bubbly wholesome pfps
Celeste,Finally IGN recognises a real 10/10
Celeste,"best game sound track........... 
All of Hollow knight sound tracks:
Am I a joke to you?"
Celeste,yes its a true 10 - one of the best ever made.
Celeste,This game is 100% jump quest.
Celeste,garbage 4bit graphics though
Celeste,Breath of the Wild is a ten..Hollow Knight is close to a ten…But we can’t go handing out tens like that
Celeste,"זה המשחק האהוב עלי אי פעם!🤩
ואני מחכה בקוצר רוח לסלסט 2!🥳"
Celeste,Celeste chapter 4
Celeste,Never thought I’d be able to agree with ign
Celeste,Wow ign don't put 3/10 becouse that game is hard
Celeste,when you see your future wife: so this is what a 10/10 looks like!
Celeste,"Celeste main game 10/10 difficult but fair and rewarding to beat 
Celeste core 8/10 very difficult but still fair-ish
B-sides 6/10 ok this is getting annoying  wh- why is this so hard? 
C-sides 3/10 ok sooo what the hell? Like this isn’t even fair 
Chapter-9 Farewell 0.9/10 F**K YOU! AND I’LL SEE YOU NEVER!!!
At least for me"
Celeste,u young morons don't know what a platformer is smfh
Celeste,So charming
Celeste,A great game for the winter season!
Celeste,1.3k people must be fans of Dean Takahashi and couldn't get past the first level
Celeste,On psnow :)
Celeste,Please don’t say I’m the only person who comes to this game ever so often just to play through the first 2 chapters then give up on the next
Celeste,Easiest 10 ever. It's honestly hard to find a flaw with this game. By far my favourite platformer and indie game.
Celeste,Damn the music tho
Celeste,Hope it'll be released in mobile like ios or android
Celeste,When a $20 game has more quality control than a $60 AAA game
Celeste,This game is only enjoyed by psychopaths.
Celeste,its not a 10 for me for the simple reason that its hard enough for casuals. this game is catered for hardcore.
Celeste,16 bit Gaming will never die.
Celeste,It could have won goty if it came out in 2019
Celeste,10/10 review
Celeste,It's on sale right now! 5 dollars
Celeste,Is this the kind of game that will appeal to the Meat Boy fan?
Celeste,"0/10, not fun to play"
Celeste,"This Review made me buy it. 3 years later it is still my favorite game of all time and that,  sad to admit as I'm a gamer since 1995, means a lot"
Celeste,Let us reflect on what one of the cons say about Sonic Colors “-Difficulty Spikes”
Celeste,This game was amazing
Celeste,Just started playing today - it’s brilliant. Believe the hype.
Celeste,"Didn’t die once.
Pretty easy game"
Celeste,gameplay similar to Knytt Stories and Knytt Underground
Celeste,superb graphics
Celeste,I’d personally give it an 8
Celeste,how can he give Celeste 10 but doom a 5 for being too hard
Celeste,The music is not a masterpiece but keeps you thrilled while playing the game
Celeste,"If someone doesn't think games are art, just show them Celeste."
Celeste,Died nearly 3000 times. How about you guys?😁🙌
Celeste,"one of 2 games worthy of the 10 rank it got (the other one is undertale), still furious that hollow knight didn't get a 10"
Celeste,"After a solid 250 hours on the game, I'd say that it's worth an 11"
Celeste,IGN does a review that is correct? il be damm'd
Celeste,"I’d give it a 9.5 some parts are too drawn out. Like (spoilers below)







The boss with your other self. That just annoyed me with no fun.

Edit: I’ve changed my opinion: Celeste is defiantly a 10, along with hollow knight"
Celeste,"my man sounds like hes in a tin can, cmon ign, have some decency. your like a multi million company"
Celeste,poor mans rogue legacy.
Celeste,"IGN stands for

Incredible
Gamer
News"
Celeste,"I laughed in my head about the score before I bought the game. I thought that there was no way a 2D platformer can be at the level of the best of the best of classics. I bought the game and I 100% agree with the score, and it is my favorite game as it changed the way I view life and my positivity."
Celeste,"One of the best games I played on Xbox 
Deserves a 10/10"
Celeste,"""Best soundtrack in years"", no chance."
Celeste,1.2k people couldn't get past Granny's driveway
Celeste,I cant give it a 10 because the characters are a little annoying and the talking hurts my ears.
Celeste,Damn right it better get a ten 8)
Celeste,7/10 for me. I enjoyed it but get the feeling reviewers are falling over themselves to give it a 10
Celeste,"ok i completely agree with this review, but wow tom i never knew that speedrunners are supposed to go through a chapter as fast as possible"
Celeste,"If they counted Farewell, it would be an 11"
Celeste,its the simple things. I've played 35 hours and came here to hear someone gush about my favorite game
Celeste,"you know what i'm impressed that a modern game reviewer can even get past the first chapter of celeste so this review is okay, even though it only talks about the obvious."
Celeste,Celeste really make you feel like you are depressed .
Celeste,I forgot to breathe
Celeste,Downvotes are from people who struggle to finish Celeste.
Celeste,"So hollow knight doesn't get more than 9.5 yet this gets a 10 👀
I'm not saying it's bad but who ever reviewed hollow knight is just a noob I mean they literally gave rain world a 6 for being too hard"
Celeste,"Overall pretty bad game, did nothing for me 

9.8 it has a little something for everyone"
Celeste,I dowloaded it thinking i would play for an hour.... 3 hours later...
Celeste,The controls are terrible on pc
Celeste,best game!!!!
Celeste,"2:20 
Hollow Knight:
Allow me to introduce myself"
Celeste,3:03
Celeste,hidden gem. buy it to support starving developers
Celeste,"Even after 2 years, not a single person can say her name right"
Celeste,"I’m so glad games like this are still being produced. With my motion sickness I can’t play most 3D games, glad there are still quality side scrollers out there."
Celeste,"I knew I was bad at video games, but now i know how much: it took me a little more than 20 hrs to finish the first 7 chapters, and this guy says it should take 6-8 hrs. I liked the game, but in no way I'm going to look for the crystal hearts, much less try to finish the chapter 9. Thank the youtubers for allow me to see those chapters."
Celeste,I've beat the game twice and I'm gonna try and beat it in a day soon
Celeste,She really dashes with that exaggerated swagger
Celeste,"Solid 10, straight up"
Celeste,5:00 SPOILERS KINDA
Celeste,I was disappointed with it. It's overrated...
Celeste,so many years and now i get to play it on my steamdeck. thanks to humble <3
Celeste,"i love how the only criticism he has is only there because he didn’t realise you can get a heart in every single level of the main campaign. seriously one of the best games ever, love you dunk"
Celeste,bro i have 10k deaths on farewell
Celeste,me coming back to this video for 1:37 for help on the B-side
Celeste,Mid game
Celeste,i agree with that last one that makes a lot of sense tbh
Celeste,"Celeste is amazing for multiple reasons I can only sum up in a paragraph.


The **story** is gut renching, and you can tell it is really personal and a therapy session in itself.

The **music** by Lena raine won awards and is so well written and has layers of symbolism and motifs intergrated.

The music is so well **integrated,** You can understand the story again just by registering to the music, as there can be up to around even 4 different tracks per stage, smoothly integrated, allowing room for silence.

The **game play** is smooth and satisfying af, with many small details like coyote time and corner correction which make it feel nice and by being short screens, it can be ultra hard, but never unfair, and allows for more precision because screens are shorter.


That's why Celeste worked. It was not one thing, but all those combined. With all that, it doesn't matter what fills out the screens, it's already so well done.

Celeste,I wish redheads were real
Celeste,Celeste is a platformer about a stubborn little boy who wont accept reality so he climbs a mountain.
Celeste,"1:07 Fortnite feathers, how do i get Fortnite feathers?"
Celeste,All dunkey needs to do now is play strawberry jam collab! Maybe! Hopefully! …please?
Celeste,"Hardest game I’ve ever played. If you think darksouls is harder, you haven’t played level 9 of celeste"
Celeste,Obviously the best version of this game is Celeste classic on the ti-84 graphing calculator.
Celeste,Celeste is the first trans type game
Celeste,"dunkey finds this hard, and he's got Bowser's Big Bean Burrito. don't understimate this game"
Celeste,"I know this video is five years old, but I felt the need to point out that there are blue hearts in the a-sides, you just have to find them"
Celeste,2:14 I wonder where the extra 5 berries came from in his total. Did he think that there's 175 in 1-7 and then 5 more in 8 maybe?
Celeste,that funny (r/Tomorrow) indie game
Celeste,Dunkey is so powerful that he didn't become trans after playing Celeste
Celeste,bro had to go through 4 b sides to open chap 8. rip bozo. he didnt know there were hearts in normal levels
Celeste,You... Don't have to complete the b-sides... There's hearts in the main levels
Celeste,stubborn man*
Celeste,Thank goodness donkey doesn't know about C-sides. The rating might have gone below zero
Celeste,Watched this video again in preps of the new Celeste coming out Feb 17 2023 - Props and GL in the next one
Celeste,"I was really happy about the heart requirement, because I felt rewarded for getting hearts... There are hearts in the regular levels, but you gotta really look for them. And how do you not mention the music and sound design in this game? It's undeniably a 5/5."
Celeste,"To be fair, hearts are in every level, just hidden"
Celeste,"I never quit a video, but Celeste, this piece of sh*t game nearly made me quit. But I am already in the Summit level, so I will finish it somehow. But I have hated every  second of this overrated game. So annoying, trying a screen 100 times. My god...totally overrated. Unprecise controls. Pure luck if you survive a screen."
Celeste,"Man, how has it been 5 years since Celeste came out...

Time flies man"
Celeste,"Celeste was one of the hardest games I've ever played. I screamed A LOT at it. My dad while I was on vacation (I was 29 when this came out) would come out to watch me play, and I would SCREAM at it SO FUCKING ANGRILY. He'd ask, ""Why do you play it if it makes you so mad?"" ""I DONT FUCKING KNOW BUT I HAVE TO BEAT IT""

And beat it I did. And uninstalled it. And never touched it again. 5/5, would recommened."
Celeste,fix ur voice please <3
Celeste,Celeste is a game that really makes you FEEL like a trans woman
Celeste,What song plays at the end of this video
Celeste,FYI for anyone thrown off by Dunkey’s point about unlocking the “final level.” You are able to unlock them by getting the blue crystal hearts in the regular levels which are much easier than the cassette levels :)
Celeste,"4/5?
funny way of saying 5/4"
Celeste,I bought this game for $3 will try soon
Celeste,"I wish Dunkey had known that there are hearts in every level, because him thinking the only way to get them was from the B side probly ruined his enjoyment of ""The Core"" level."
Celeste,"0:06  Based
I think it's right to call the main character ""she"", because this is the original canon and not the shit that came out of the creators later, declaring the character a trans"
Celeste,"Here at 6,939,093 views. (before that too)"
Celeste,Cassette levels are basically kaizo levels.
Celeste,YOU JUST HAVE TO UNLOCK THE BSIDES FOR THE CORE NOT BEAT THE BSIDES 😭
Celeste,"I'm sure others have already mentioned this but the main chapters have hearts too
They are just hidden really well so they reward exploration and puzzle solving more than anything

Other than that as many others have already said it's a wonderful game with beautiful music and an amazing story that hits you hard in the feels if you can relate
It has tons of challenge content if you love to push yourself (some of which gets downright sadistic lol) and it very quickly became one of my all time favorite games"
Celeste,at one point during the game i accidentally loaded up a B-side and almost quit the game because I didn't realise it was a thing that was optional and thought I was too bad to even complete the game. Those levels are evil.
Celeste,"Dang dunkey, only 4 out of 5? Utter foolishness. You have lost all my respect as a game reviewer. This game is a 6 out of 5 im never watching this awful channel again. 



Dont take me seriously. 
Anyway celeste is such an insanely amazingly designed game that makes you feel lile you figured out everything yourself even though it was teaching you in subtle ways. Its fantastic game design that will aid me when i make a game in the future. Already have some of the mechanics planned out"
Celeste,trooncore
Celeste,Can't wait to play a BIGMODE game y'all!!
Celeste,hidden gem
Celeste,the videos make you FEEEEEEL like these comments are funny. and getting funnier everytime some comedian does them. i have to smile if they keep doing the joke.
Celeste,thought this was gonna be celeste pizza reviews 6.9/10
Celeste,Yeah don't mention the music..
Celeste,"The game that turned SO MANY life's lmao
Can't say that it did with mine but the game really is one of the most fun games I've played in the past 3-4 years <3"
Celeste,I always come back to this video when I’m having trouble with a tape and the ‘they are fking evil’ makes me feel better every time. Thank you dunkey.
Celeste,proud of dunkey for coming out as a trans woman by expressing love for this game
Celeste,"Haven’t played it yet, CLASSIC"
Celeste,"And then they released Chapter 9 :)
I honestly didn't feel thaaaat much of a challenge until I reached Farewell. That's when I got true satisfaction from beating the game."
Celeste,That’s just a thomp
Celeste,i'm surprised he didn't give it a 5/5...
Celeste,You don't have to beat the cassettes to get hearts
Celeste,Oh right. This was the video that sold me on Celeste.
Celeste,"I don't play celeste, and im gonna be honest I never will, but dam the music is great in this game"
Celeste,4 years late but you can get hearts from the normal levels you don’t have to do side B’s
Celeste,I got platinum on this game around 2018 I still can’t believe I was able to complete C-sides and the extra level they updated in
Celeste,"When we really think about it, Celeste was the first modern Strand type game."
Celeste,"Player : ""Finally ! I've reached the top of the mountain !""
The game : ""Tutorial complete"""
Celeste,you can get the crystal hearts in the regular levels too
Celeste,"“Less about pixel perfect.”


Farewell be like…"
Celeste,This game inspired mario maker 2
Celeste,ew trans
Celeste,"420 deaths is pretty good, i got over 1000 on my first playthrough in the hotel chapter"
Celeste,This might actually be the first strand type game
Celeste,Haha the cassette levels arent too hard
Celeste,"you know, you can just do the normal crystal hearts lmao"
Celeste,1:32 I fucking felt this
Celeste,What? You don't even finish the last two levels?
Celeste,"I know dunky’s comments are a place for recycling jokes not actually commenting on the video and I normally love it
But I just beat this game myself and dunky ain’t lying, shit was phenomenal"
Celeste,You just noop
Celeste,Celeste really makes you feel anxiety and panic attack
Celeste,0:11 music name?
Celeste,dunkey's videos are just awesome 🔥
Celeste,thank you dunkey
Celeste,Did you realise you can get hearts without doing the b sides?
Celeste,Did dunkey ever find out you can get hearts in the regular levels?
Celeste,you could have just replayed the levels for the hearts that are blue
Celeste,"Am I the only one who had little struggle on the first 5 b-sides? There was a struggle but nowhere near the amount others had. Another strange thing is that instead of going for the hearts in b-sides, you could just get the ones in the a-sides instead. The blue crystal hearts are just easy puzzles (or impossible when talking about chapter 5) that are beside the main game. These hearts usually require just a little bit of thinking to get down (looking at chapter 2 and 6)"
Celeste,1:24 The irony in this statement is that the modded level are exactly this. Anything Grandmaster is fuckin' ridiculous.
Celeste,5 out of 5 bananas
Celeste,torture the game but pretty cool doe
Celeste,"“How do you get hearts? Beat these cassette levels”
I hate to break it to you but…"
Celeste,"Yeah astronomically late on this one but you can also gets hearts through some pretty interesting Easter eggs in the Maine levels, which is what I did. It makes the barrier to beating the final level significantly less challenging"
Celeste,"Yeah, but fuck the moon"
Celeste,The game fixes the bonus level problem Dunkey had by adding a DLC that's way harder than anything else in the entire game.
Celeste,Honestly core is easy don’t @ me
Celeste,"1:10 two words, Angry Birds"
Celeste,Moon berry anyone?
Celeste,"Dunkey: Celeste is the best video game ever
Hollow Knight: Hey"
Celeste,you present games like no one else. I just started watching 3-4-5-6-7-8 years old Donkey's videos and it's been a pleasure😊
Celeste,If only he knew you could collect them in the a side levels
Celeste,the sound effect in 2:57 gave me an eargasm
Celeste,"Man, the music in that game is so good."
Celeste,it looks like a cool math game
Celeste,Sequel needed
Hades,10/10 imo
Hades,This is a poor man’s Diablo.
Hades,Great Job on the Nick Limon!!!
Hades,Lmao
Hades,Is this better/ easier to play with controller or m&k?
Hades,It took me over 60 deaths to escape. I'm waaaay below average.
Hades,Thanks! I’m gonna check Hades out. Just finishing off Cult of the Lamb first.
Hades,This game is fuckin awesome. Never played rogues before and needed something new.
Hades,"Looks like a phone game you play on the toilet.
Hard Pass - Pun intended."
Hades,Love this game!!!
Hades,"Bought it recently, enjoying it very much"
Hades,1:33 What about fellatio followed by prostate play and intimate cuddles with your life partner on a beanbag with cocoa?🥰
Hades,It was a 10
Hades,Amazing game. So addictive and well made overall.
Hades,Just bought this. Looks amazing. The art work is beautiful
Hades,Ayooo the sequel finna be lit
Hades,I’m a person who doesn’t understand why people like this game so much.
Hades,A marvel game in this exact style would be fun
Hades,‘Aunts’ *shows athena*
Hades,the painting at 2:39 xd
Hades,Really fun game with a lot of content. Solid 9/10. My only gripe being that the ending was rather underwhelming
Hades,This game looks complex and confusing
Hades,WOOOOOOOOO
Hades,Devlop open world games for Nintendo Switch please 🥺
Hades,It’s 10 come on
Hades,Is it like Diablo 3?
Hades,This game is very addictive 🥰
Hades,Looks very similar to diablo
Hades,Hades is the avatar after Aang lol
Hades,This Guy's knowledge is more than most of the EA employees
Hades,It's hilarious that 90% of the people in the comment section talking about how bad this game looks are Horizon Forbidden West players (according to their own uploads). Comparing an AAA game made by almost 400 employees with a 100 million dollar budget to an indie game made by a dozen people is just sad.
Hades,Imagine getting the latest and greatest console to play a comic book graphics game yikes
Hades,My buddy got me this for my birthday yesterday and boy is this game fun
Hades,This is one of the best games I'm played. Endless replayability fo'sho
Hades,So you start all the way over when you die
Hades,"I'm going to be honest, I'm bored and was looking between this and MHA One's Justice 2 (because it's 75% off and I'm a nerd). This helped me decide, so thanks!"
Hades,latest video game review ign propagations
Hades,filled with fleer cards filled with attributes
Hades,Create a treasure chest
Hades,This game needs to be on iOS
Hades,Just escaped for the first time on my 30th attempt and still feel like I’ve only just scratched the surface of the story. Love it.
Hades,Playing this on switch now. Awesome game
Hades,"So enemies just scale to your level and adapt to your abilities. Why even try then?
Same old garbage lazy game mechanics as usual."
Hades,Sung jin woo training arc
Hades,2021 game with 1980 tech. 10/10??? Omaigod 🤦
Hades,crazy that you played this on a mouse instead of using a controller
Hades,This game is way too hard for me
Hades,Damn spoilers
Hades,This game surprised me.
Hades,zeus is the brother of hades...
Hades,Why no co-op!  Looks awesome other than that
Hades,"Can't wait for the sequel, rabies."
Hades,"seems very west of dead... minus the Ron Perlman, of course!"
Hades,Looks like a cartoonish diablo knockoff
Hades,I've only left tarterset once and I'm run 33
Hades,The ethical development makes this a 10. No crunch.
Hades,can someone remind me which street fighter has strikers?
Hades,It won a hugo award give it 10 now!
Hades,Is it just me or does hades look kind of like sasuke with rinnegan
Hades,This review made me buy the game
Hades,So we're here cause of the Hugo Award Announcement right?
Hades,Hugo award winning games!
Hades,Just downloaded on Xbox Game Pass. Absolutely fantastic
Hades,This is a 10
Hades,Best game Ive played since Breath of the Wild through 3 times one straight to Gannon once with no violence like Hawksaw Ridge and once did everything yes Terry Town and all
Hades,Well written review!
Hades,"This was an incredible review, aside from the 9. This is easily a 10/10. Perhaps top 25 video games of all time."
Hades,"It looks like total crap! What is this, 1985? A tiny little cartoon running around? omg"
Hades,Currently doing a giveaway on my channel if anyone wants to try the game for themselves
Hades,Man this game is so addicting.
Hades,It’s to addicting
Hades,"Picked it up on sale on switch, 10/10"
Hades,They gave Deathloop a 10 xD
Hades,I’m 25 attempts in and I’ve only gotten to the third boss. It’s hard af lol
Hades,9 is too low!
Hades,Any link for the game?
Hades,"Awesome game, and review guy did great. But outed himself as a n00b by saying lucky tooth is better than Olympian keepsakes (just joshing)"
Hades,Game Looks Wack
Hades,"What a Masterpiece of a game this is, love it..."
Hades,"Your review put me onto the game, but my family resent you"
Hades,There wasn’t any complaint y not a 10
Hades,guess im the only one who finds this game boring
Hades,HLD?
Hades,"Wow this game is epic ,  what make this game so unique is the fact that they manage to bring merit to characters just by taking even though there are no single cut scene ..."
Hades,Just bought it on ps5..
Hades,so not a 7 for once
Hades,"Reggin, Reggin, Reggin"
Hades,Thanks to game pass  let's do this!!!
Hades,Crap
Hades,How are people playing these cartoonish games
Hades,This game is amazing. Damn son.
Hades,This is the first game in years that's had me in my seat for a solid 10+ hours of non stop playing. Solid 10 for me
Hades,"what does the reviewer mean by ""street fighter-style assists?"" street fighter is a 1v1 fighter."
Hades,So…why was Hades a 9 again?
Hades,Looks like Devil May Cry + Diablo
Hades,"can someone tell me Hades is compared to what, is it like diablo o like twin stick shooter but sword fighting?"
Hades,"Ugh. Can we get a linear game please? Every indie game is either a pixelart metrdriodvania, or procedurally generated rougelike. Enough already."
Hades,The soundtrack sold me
Hades,"You Switch users are rather coy.  This is one of the greatest games I've ever played, and y'all have been like ""It's fine"", for the past year.  This game is a freaking masterpiece."
Hades,It's finally available on game pass 🔥
Hades,"i actually haven't played this game yet at all, but i have seen someone play it for a short time, and the music just got me. i constantly and consistently listen to the music playlist - it is phenomenal"
Hades,Very balanced and well-crafted review. Thank you sir.
Hades,"Very well done Video! I was on the Fence for a long time for this Game and u finally sold me on it, so i did buy it. Hoping i end up liking it :D"
Hades,"oh man im 100 hours deep and nowhere near 100%, valiant effort getting this one to completion sir"
Hades,I believe Hades 2 will be a descent into Hades to kill a boss at the lowest level.
Hades,"Rogue-likes are games that I want to enjoy, but the nature of them doesn’t appeal to me. I bought Hades and agree the combat is fantastic. But I don’t want to go through the same scenarios hundreds of times to get everything from the game. I much prefer games like Hollow Knight for the adventure aspect. 
So I’ve found that nobody really hates Hades. They either love it, or it’s just not their type of game. 

Great review as always!"
Hades,"Bro, I been trying to get out of Hades for years and still haven't done it. 
You are definitely the Top G of gaming. Wow "
Hades,"As an avid Hades player, thank you for this comprehensive review, your praises weren't overdramatic and your criticisms were all fair. The only thing I think you missed is just how fantastic the games aesthetics are. from the character models, art style, enemy design, room designs, sound design, voice acting and the MUSIC everything that this game provides as an aesthetic experience is simply top notch. Far, far better than many contemporary AAA titles."
Hades,"Literally one of the best games ever made. Every aspect of it is just perfect. VO, music, writing and don't forget about the gameplay.... Goddamn. SuperGiant just blows a majority of these AAA studios out of the water and it's not even close. HADES holds a special place in my heart. I've never been more excited for a sequel."
Hades,"I hope they change the fishing game. Is just boring to wait, they can do something similar to stardew valley."
Hades,For me was the game of the year. The combat is just too smooth.
Hades,"This is one of the best games ever made. The story, dialogue, music, gameplay, replay value, all top notch. Looking forward to the sequel."
Hades,"Love your work, man - and thanks - you've gotten me to reinstall this one! I love the tight control in this game, it's truly excellent."
Hades,"I loved this game at the beginning, but ultimately I stopped because the last 2 Maps became more unenjoyable the more often you played through them. Even with a good build that made them easy, they were still just not fun. Systems, Gameplay and Sound can be great.. but when the levels are made to be as irritating as possible it ruins everything. :( Elysium being the worst offender and most anti-fun designed place in terms of enemy design ever."
Hades,"This is one of the greatest games of all time IMO.  Supergiant are brilliant with storytelling and game design, and especially combining both to create a holistic experience"
Hades,Great review. I disagree on the visual/enemy variety. If you’re not noticing it until “40-50” hours in and think that’s a negative (especially with an Indie title at that price) I think you might be reaching. Seems pretty impressive to me. In a roguelite no less.
Hades,"Pfew…. I clicked off at 3:15 just in case. I’m still playing 😅

I will come back when im finished"
Hades,"I refuse to believe you got all of the titles, purchased every song, and got all the themes."
Hades,Nice review thanks
Hades,The best I ever got was 38 heat. Fucking love this game.
Hades,"I agree with this. I'm happy that people liked Hades, but with the lack of enemy variety and the same levels repeating I got really bored. I don't want to fight the same enemies and levels over and over and over again"
Hades,Hades is the game that got me into roguelites after previously never playing one before. It’s one of my all time favorite games
Hades,"The iconic music deserved a callout as well, those and the cutscene unlocks made those rng unlocks feel amazing and special, despite the repetitive runs to find all of them. The fact that you're also diving into the post-game story by that point and can run through faster and faster lead to a virtuous cycle of playthrough narrative on top of the varied combat through the weapon aspects. It's somewhat curious to see them sequel this given the story, but excited to see what they pull off."
Hades,"I download this game thanks to game pass, glad to say that it is an absolute gem"
Hades,"Wow, super thorough review, thanks!"
Hades,"I wish I had the drive to 100% games. 
I'd love to see ever secret and get every collectables, ect...
But I get to a point where I had my fill and move on."
Hades,Have you played Last Oricru?
Hades,"I've played on the Switch but this review has convinced me to try on PC, extremely enjoyable game though."
Hades,At the start you have limited access to the boon pool. Once you get to a certain point it opens up and the game becomes much easier.
Hades,"playing this game with kb and mouse, you must be a masochist."
Hades,"My only real issue with this game is that it doesn't really feel like Hades, as in Greek Mythology.  The levels are fairly uninspiring, with it just being a series of fairly bland rooms. and the enemies feel more science fiction that mythological.  I know the art direction was obviously a conscious choice, but the setting just feels like it was tacked on, like they had a game already made and at the last minute someone goes, ""Now we need a story."" and someone else went, ""How about Hades and Persephone?""  Clearly that isn't what happened, but it mostly feels like that to me."
Hades,"I got the true ending and thought I was done didn't know there was an epilogue, ""when I thought I was out the pull me back in"""
Hades,One of the GOTY of 2020 and all time!
Hades,"I’m not really into this type of game, but I loved hades"
Hades,Thanks for going back and hitting old titles that most people have moved on from. Made me want to dust off the game and waste that boomer Hades.
Hades,"Out of all rogue lites and rogue likes I have played and liked Noita the most. Also I can not recommend you to try to 100% that one. You could go through so many other games with that time.
Fantastic game though. Also people should not be hesitant to seek knowledge about that game if they feel like it. Game is way deeper than you would expect."
Hades,What was your favorite build?
Hades,"Did you try using a controller as well? I can see how this game could be played on keyboard and mouse, but the controller button mashing always felt intertwined with the gameplay."
Hades,"Oh no, now I have to go back to Hades once again to finally get that true ending. Oh well."
Hades,did... did you actually play this on keyboard and mouse? good god man you're nuts!
Hades,"you should check out Bastion and Transistor aswell.

Bastion is sort of the same but as a linear game instead of a rougelite and its really great.
Transistor should be even better but i havent played that yet '*hides in shame*"
Hades,"My favorite aspect of this game is probably the Daedalus hammers and the different Aspects of weapons. They sometimes change how you use the weapon, and at the least, feel unique enough in their styles that it can shape how you want a run to go.

My only request for Hades 2 is that there's more interactions between gods and their boons. Seeing how they're so important to runs, they should interact with each other more, perhaps even spurn you if you decide to choose one boon giver over another. To me, in this game, they feel like different types of number/stat increases that don't change how you play.  Also, I think gems, darkness, coins, poms, etc should be earned more in the level rather than as the reward for completing a level. They take away from the most enjoyable aspect of the game which, to me, is crafting and building up a unique Zagreus each run.

Edit: Let me just add, this is one of my favorite games of all time. While SuperGiant Games are a AA developer, they're veterans in the industry and their production quality is rarely matched. It's unreal what they pulled off with this game. It has so much focus in design that it should be studied. What a phenomenal game."
Hades,"I'm so excited what Supergiant will do with the sequel, how much more can they do? This already is at the pinnacle of roguelikes"
Hades,"I can't wait for Hades 2.
Hades 1 kept my attention for so long"
Hades,"According to my Switch, I've put over 1500 hours into this game since Dec. 2020. I'm neurodivergent and I find some repetition to be soothing, so I play while listening to YT vids like this as decompression.

This was a great review, and covered all the most important bases thoroughly.

As someone else pointed out, I don't think Daedalus Hammers were mentioned, and they can be run-defining. My favorite is the Exploding Launher (available on certain spear aspects). The problem with hammers is that they are immune to RNG manipulation; speed runners hate it, so there are mods to mitigate it, but I play on Switch so...

Another thing I noticed (again mentioned elsewhere in the comments) was that Hell mode is much more than just those 5 permanent Heat. The removal of i-frames when you take damage really forces you to think harder about your boon choices and how you approach different threats, especially at higher heats. That said, I find the game more fun on Normal because I feel less restricted in my options.

And regarding threats, the low number of enemy types is noticeable, but easily mitigated by the Pact of Punishment. Two levels of Benefits Package plus Middle Management and Extreme Measures really spices up the existing enemy types.

None of this matters if you aren't broken like me and just want to finish the game though, so again, GREAT WORK Mortis!"
Hades,I don't usually comment on game reviews but I just want to say that I appreciate this kind of content is that you make.
Hades,Finally a game on the channel that I also managed to 100% <3
Hades,"I started the game last month, had it sitting in my library for a while. Just as I was starting to really progress the game crashed during a save and got corrupted, I have to start a new one, I'm glad that I was only 10 hours in or so :p
As far as action roguelikes go I'm pretty set up with Hades and Dead Cells for years to come as I'm not that good at them so progress can be veeery slow XD
It's a bit strange to know Hades 2 is in preparation, Supergiant Games don't usually do sequels. My favourite so far is Transistor, for the variety of builds and unique real time with pause combat <3"
Hades,Would love to see a video talking about mount and blade bannerlord! Lots of rpg elements and a bit of a kingdom come deliverance vibe. Sadly no fantasy though.
Hades,"I've also 100% Hades and I got to say it's my favorite grind so far, I've done Elden Ring, all the dark souls, Sekiro and so much more but Hades is something special."
Hades,"My only problem with the dash abilities being interesting and varies is just that Athena's is so absolutely broken that other than Poseidon, I just am not very happy with the others.  They can be neat, but can't compare to, you know, more invulnerability on command."
Hades,Amazon raised the price by like $8 after you posted this review 😂❤
Hades,"Hi, you should check out Dungeon of Naheulbeuk, a little French tactical strategy RPG. 
I think it is up your alley and needs more love, and would be easy for you to 100%, I am having so much fun with it as it's unique."
Hades,About the only thing I haven't done in this game is unlock skelly's third statue.
Hades,How do you get these done so fast?
Hades,I tried to get into Hades when it was on Gamepass. I just wasn't feeling it. That's when I realized I don't like Roguelikes. I couldn't get into Deathloop either. The game wasn't hard but I don't like playing the same levels over and over again.
Hades,Please review Chained Echoes
Hades,Probably my fave game of the past 5 years. So well crafted
Hades,So glad you checked this!
Hades,"Hades is one of the few games I got 100% in. Played over 300 hours and loved every minute.

Mort, what's your favourite build? One I really enjoy is the ""super soaker"" build (Lucifer gun with Poseidon attack and Zeus duo)."
Hades,"You're a machine, a tremendously skilled reviewer and gamer. Like the anti-game journalist lol."
Hades,any chance you might look at their game Transistor?  I'd be interested in what you'd think of that one.
Hades,Great game. I had a bunch of fun with this one. Props to you for 100% on this one … that’s a looooot of runs.
Hades,"I do love how Dusa is the maid for the house.  Thus Maid-Dusa, and she's a gorgon  😂  I just found that so amusing."
Hades,Thank you for such a thorough review.  I respect your commitment to 100% completion.
Hades,"I'm glad you got 100%, I think I'm just not able to enjoy fast games like this anymore. Nowadays I stick to turn based wrath of the righteous. Trying to get into dos2 as well, but ugh something about it just doesn't gel with me like wotr. Anyways, just wanted to say I enjoy your videos. I'll be hitting up wasteland 3 soon, based on your video that I watched a couple hours ago."
Hades,Post your run stats!
Hades,Great stuff as usual
Hades,I hope Hades will one day go mobile.
Hades,"Wow! There is a lot more to this game than I thought!
I never played  a roguelike game before but if I ever decide to invest my time into one, Hades will be the first one that I'll play"
Hades,This is a great game. A life saver in the summer of 2020 and 2021
Hades,"If I were a developer of Hades, knowing all too well the accolades, awards & reception, and I knew YOU were in process of a review, I would *still* hold my breath."
Hades,"Hades II is going to be about Melinoe, Zagreus's sister (well half-sister in mythology but SG is likely going to remove the icky history of her birth) and Hecate.

In the mythology Melinoe is Persephone's daughter with Zeus after he pretended to be Hades to knock her up. Which if you're paying attention Persephone is already Zeus and Demeter's daughter so it's pretty gross. Good money on SG removing the Zeus part."
Hades,Hades is an outstanding game. Plus the voice acting is wonderful. Esp Meg...
Hades,I ve heard the game is massive great job!!!
Hades,"Maybe I missed it, but I don't think he mentioned Daedalus Hammer that you can find during the runs that can drastically change how your weapon works in addition to the changes brought by the weapon aspect. The game is really good even for people that don't play much rougelikes thanks to the demigod mode."
Hades,Love this game so much! Wish it would come back to Game Pass 😭
Hades,Who was your favourite character in Hades (except Zag)?
Hades,"Yeah, I doubt this one will break me in with roguelites... I don't like them and I doubt I like this one. Tried out Dead Cells and was bored already after not 2 hours. Watched my friend play it with his save and was scratching my head why the game seems to drop the more fun stuff only when you sink in 50 hours.
Anyway great review!"
Hades,Seems like this could evolve to one of my new favourite channels ➡️ good work
Hades,"What about the music in this game?
Supergiant games normally has some killer soundtrack.

This game is on my wishlist for some time, and I even don't like roguelikes. Supergiant is a very talented indie studio, I loved Bastion and Transistor."
Hades,Play Hollow Knight next.
Hades,Still waiting on a GOG release before I buy it...
Hades,Thanks!
Hades,i recently 100'd myself. its one of the best games ever made. top 10 unquestionably.
Hades,It good
Hades,My man just casually includes footage of the final boss.
Hades,Nice
Hades,"You are such a mad lad for completing this game!

It's a phenomenal title, but the side quests do drag on way too many runs in post game so I didn't finish them.

My favorite weapon was the gloves, simply because you can spam attacks with just holding the button.

Interesting that you played on keyboard, having 360 movements in this game is very helpful"
Hades,Having played this game when it launched. You nailed this review. I was about 50hrs in with a couple of clears when I got bored and frustrated with the rng. Still really enjoyed what I did play but doubt I’ll ever see the real ending.
Hades,Hades is one of the best games I've ever played and I got 100% of the achievements and loved doing it. My favorite weapon is the bow with triple shot cuz it's powerful when you get close.
Hades,First!
Hades,"those rooms at 2:45 and 2:55, where in the game are those? I have put countless hours into the game and beat it once, but never have seen those rooms before. are they secret rooms?"
Hades,Great game! Glad you enjoyed it 😂
Hades,This 100 percent must’ve felt so great
Hades,Its first game that i maxed out.
Hades,"21:47 ""It's complicated without being overwhelming.""  Thank you for the impressively thorough review. Even though it's an older game, you still managed to teach me a several knew elements about it. Onward to 200k. All glory to the algorithm."
Hades,Bump
Hades,Bruh i just wish i could finish as many games as you! Love ur work! Keep it up
Hades,"Man I loved this game and beat it ages ago, but I didn't even know half of those progression systems even existed."
Disco Elysium,"2:50 Based
5:00 Holyyy"
Disco Elysium,Sorry but this game looks way too tedious.
Disco Elysium,Its so much better now. All the clipping bugs are gone and the dialogue is fully voiced now
Disco Elysium,"The game promised much, but in reality it is a jumble of doubly pseudo-intellectual text that could pass as ironic if it were sufficiently grounded in something compelling. The core problem is that as time goes by you find that it is a useless script, characters that stand like lampposts in place all the time, a map that is appealing in principle but becomes tedious and tiresome day by day. The character setup files, the ideas, the objects, promised a lot, but in the end nothing work toghether nothing materializes, it never works with the script and the text of the story that is with capital letters a heavy indescribable suffering.

They need much better scriptwriters, and real hardcore gamers to redesign all the game throw the garbage by the window (with director included) and try it again without mumbo jumbo gibberish wathever comes to mind deceiving ""playing"" system."
Disco Elysium,looks rly boring
Disco Elysium,this sounds so cool wtf
Disco Elysium,this guy should write a movie or a tv show. its so pristine and elegant without coming off as pompous or pretentious
Disco Elysium,😎🤙👍👍
Disco Elysium,"I'm planning to play this game but seeing the gameplay and the texts, it overwhelmed me!"
Disco Elysium,"combat isnt a focus + freedom gameplay like DnD game, this game is like torment: tides of numenera"
Disco Elysium,limmy does a big shite
Disco Elysium,"Just picked it up this week. I've already sunk 12 hours in! Deserved its score, but the final cut is easily 10/10 for me."
Disco Elysium,So it has divinity original sin 2 narrated amazing writing for an entire game? That is INSANELY AWESOME.
Disco Elysium,uh huh
Disco Elysium,Insteresting
Disco Elysium,Best game ever. Pathologic is in second.
Disco Elysium,this game looks soooooooooooo boring
Disco Elysium,commie pinkos
Disco Elysium,"Consoles need trial versions. I'm so intrigued by this but, I'm afraid it's not for me"
Disco Elysium,Bought this game 5 min into the review.. 😁
Disco Elysium,"looks fun, but imma wait for it to be on sale"
Disco Elysium,IGN employee who actually knows what he's doing
Disco Elysium,fave ign review
Disco Elysium,What is the background music? Is it from the game?
Disco Elysium,极乐迪斯科牛批
Disco Elysium,"They forgot to mention its a world built on fantastic communistic ideas that has now collapsed under the weight of these same radical ideas, with it's streets now filled with the broken spirited and poor people struggling with high crime on one side, and on the other side the capitalistic docks unapologetically, working making money, surviving and thriving lol"
Disco Elysium,Free ps plus game haaawoooooo
Disco Elysium,Ps plus?
Disco Elysium,Tragic but also homorous.
Disco Elysium,This reviewer alone restores some of my faith in IGN. He's the best I've seen/heard through your site.
Disco Elysium,Love this game. If you don't have a PC or console get it on stadia
Disco Elysium,what's the music in the background?
Disco Elysium,Masterpiece.
Disco Elysium,日本でも発売して欲しい！
Disco Elysium,how is this baned in aus
Disco Elysium,"""Disco Elysium plays like no other video game I've ever seen. It's closest analogue is perhaps the outstanding Divinity: Original Sin 2."" 

I disagree with it being close to D:OS2 in how it plays. D:OS2 has a strong focus on turn-based combat, positioning, tactics, manipulating the environment, and skills primarily focus on improving combat ability. On the other hand, Disco Elysium's focus is on characters, dialogue, solving the mystery of who you are, and the gameplay/skills primarily influence how conversations/dialogue plays out. The closest game to DE is probably Planescape: Torment. In that game you also wake up with amnesia and the primary mystery and focus of the story is learning about your past and who are you. While there is real-time with pause (RTWP) combat in PS:T, the primary focus and gameplay is on narrative and dialogue. Raising your stats in the game can have a big impact on dialogue options in the game, similar to DE."
Disco Elysium,Imagine if triple A companies did graphics like this. This is so much better.
Disco Elysium,It reminds me of the original FALLOUT.
Disco Elysium,Coming to PlayStation sooooon 🥳
Disco Elysium,Anyone else looking forward to playing this for the first time next week when The Final Cut is released on PS5?
Disco Elysium,Who's here cuz they put out the PS5 version???...
Disco Elysium,"passionlessly undersells what is a beautiful, art piece of a game"
Disco Elysium,"The word ""psyche"" is pronounced with two syllables: ""si-kee"", not ""sike""."
Disco Elysium,Represent 🇪🇪🇪🇪🇪🇪
Disco Elysium,What was the game at 2:05
Disco Elysium,the art style reminds me of the Urbz Sims in the city for GBA/DS.
Disco Elysium,This game destroys cp2077 rpg mechanics
Disco Elysium,This is the best PC game I've played in a decade. As a long time gamer is wonderful to find something so magical again.
Disco Elysium,Who wanna bet 100$ that all anime fan boys choose thinker?
Disco Elysium,"So passionate, was desperate to download this. Thank you, reviewer"
Disco Elysium,Simon Cardy is the best reviewer IGN has. No one else comes close. 💯
Disco Elysium,this game played against my anxiety so bad that it made it hard for me to play - still greatly enjoyed it
Disco Elysium,"Why is this reviewer with IGN and not some high quality indie reviewer, christ"
Disco Elysium,is it for xbox or ps4?
Disco Elysium,Sorry if already asked but what is the background music in this video? A part of the OST I assume?
Disco Elysium,"I like the concept but the dialogue feels boring, long and/or difficult to understand half the time if you're a non native english speaker. I would also like more animations and voice over. it's like reading a book most of the time, you have to imagine things rather than seeing them happen. 9,6 is a really high score, it means that it's almost a masterpiece which i don't think it is."
Disco Elysium,This game makes you feel like a detective.
Disco Elysium,I just got this on iOS and I can't wait to start a new game. Perfect review!
Disco Elysium,This is how Cyberpunk should have been
Disco Elysium,does it have voice acting dialog? or just text based?
Disco Elysium,"Wow, 100% consenus on this Review, IGN never thought you can pull that Off. Maybe they gave the Game to an intern for a review, because it wasnt a triple A Game."
Disco Elysium,Just got it for $12 on epic!
Disco Elysium,Mikee Goodman lives in my head? Wonderful!
Disco Elysium,This game made me understand that I am a socialist.
Disco Elysium,Anybody know the music at 0:33?
Disco Elysium,We need on PlayStation4
Disco Elysium,i would say it's more like Torment tides of numenera than Divinity original sin 2. but what do i know....
Disco Elysium,do you need to use your intellect to discover the clues or is it just pointy clicky clicky easy?
Disco Elysium,"Looks beautiful, but I wish it was from a first person POV. I really hate looking down at my character like those old arcade video games. Kinda takes me out of the game if I can't look around from 1st person POV."
Disco Elysium,"It kinda looks like ""Sanitarium""."
Disco Elysium,this garbage got 2 awards?....
Disco Elysium,"I'm not that reading guy, playing Apex Call of duty, tlou, Halo, Fortnite and so on. And them proof the first day on this game, Make me love reading and get excited and enjoying it. Disco elysium for me became one of the favorites now🤟🏻"
Disco Elysium,this game has exactly the same core as Ghost trick: phantom detective. pure art!
Disco Elysium,"For those who might like this, check out planescape: torment"
Disco Elysium,"oooh Francis Bacon, that's it :)"
Disco Elysium,Hands down their best reviewer who doesn't sound like a filthy casual gamer who plays Candy Crush all day long
Disco Elysium,"hey man , i really felt my hair bump since the very begining of the video ! wtf"
Disco Elysium,"So I'm not the only one who forgot they were watching and IGN video, right? It was like listening to those smaller YouTubers who don't have the audience they deserve."
Disco Elysium,what is the song playing in the review?
Disco Elysium,This is the real successor of Planescape Torment.
Disco Elysium,"I was really excited for it, but it is a ton of reading. I get kinda winded mentally reading through log"
Disco Elysium,So it's D&D in the modern world. You roll. Punch Failed and smacked your own face
Disco Elysium,"""Intellect, 'Psyc,' Phsysique, Motorics"" Psyc!"
Disco Elysium,I had to like this review just cause of all the diverse and complex words he uses to describe things i dont know
Disco Elysium,Wait wait wait...mistakingly thinking I'm a rockstar? Baby Tequila Sunset is a rockstar.
Disco Elysium,"The voice sounds so boring, I could not finish this video. I get the idea that this game is so boring as well."
Disco Elysium,"great reviewer. Now I just need to decide on Divinity: Original Sin 2 and Disco Elysium. A game heralded as one of the great crpg's, or a unique reimagining of them, each with character choices that vary the gameplay and story in major and unique ways? :)

rewatching this now so I didn't miss anything"
Disco Elysium,"The game actually may take many more hours than 30. There's so much content. Unless you skip through most of it, it may even take even as much as the double."
Disco Elysium,Wanted to play a game ended up reading a goddamn novel... proceeded to uninstall
Disco Elysium,You dudes are reviewing his review
Disco Elysium,Legit structure to a review. Intelligent reviewer.
Disco Elysium,"what is the game at 2:11 i played that before, i jst forgot the title"

Disco Elysium,wranglerstar
Disco Elysium,When is this available on switch?
Disco Elysium,I hate the humor in this game. Typical midwit reddit humor someone who finds cards against humanity funny would enjoy.
Disco Elysium,The best unfinished game ever
Disco Elysium,"""There is no violence in this game"". Clearly not targeted at the US market..."
Disco Elysium,"Such a great game, too bad nobody bought it."
Disco Elysium,I love the idea of skills being characters. It just revolutionizes the RPG idea.
Disco Elysium,Gonna play this asap.
Disco Elysium,"So blown away by this game. One that gets under your skin and actually makes you think about your choices in and out of the game (your own) and idealogies. And damn, what a soundtrack.."
Disco Elysium,I've been playing The Final Cut and it BLOWS ME AWAY. This is seriously one of the greatest games ever made.
Disco Elysium,"It's an interesting game, but it's no Leisure Suit Larry 2."
Disco Elysium,Excellent
Disco Elysium,Of course the reviewer would choose Communism lol
Disco Elysium,This game would be better without all the tankie stuff in it.
Disco Elysium,"""From fascism to liberalism and everything in between"" you did not do a lot of reading for that line, did you lol"
Disco Elysium,"So it's a taking simulator, basically?"
Disco Elysium,"In this 10/02/2022, the irony of capitalism in this game is something very sad!
 😢😢😢😢"
Disco Elysium,"The author of this video is the type to tell people he reads, but he really just listens to audible."
Disco Elysium,"One of the worst detective stories ever made, period."
Disco Elysium,It was okay
Disco Elysium,"Please don't call this RPG. Only games like Dragons dogma, elder scrolls, Witcher, risen, Gothic can be called RPG. 

You are insulting all those true RPG's when you lump the above nonsense with them."
Disco Elysium,Some of the best writing I’ve seen in any medium. Phenomenal voice work and art too.
Disco Elysium,this  game made me introspect so much
Disco Elysium,"One of the best games of all time, and EASILY the best-written game of all time. ""Must-play masterpiece"" is correct"
Disco Elysium,On sale now! Gonna give it a go!
Disco Elysium,Terrible game. 5/10.
Disco Elysium,"A 10/10 game that can be played lying down on your side, with just a mouse... it's amazing."
Disco Elysium,but of course the little IGN reviewer is going to out himself as a communist.
Disco Elysium,super game
Disco Elysium,My replika told me to check this game out lol
Disco Elysium,it's amazing that a game promoting communism could receive such awards in the western world
Disco Elysium,65% off on Steam right now!

Disco Elysium,"Mainstream game reviewer is a communist. No surprises here, folks."
Disco Elysium,"Just got this on Epic Games with their holiday $10 gift certificate, for $7.99."
Disco Elysium,LOL of course Cuno is grating he is from Liverpool!!!
Disco Elysium,"Die Bewertungen kranken unter einem ganz entscheidenden Punkt:

Es wird immer gesagt, das Spiel sei fantastisch, ausergewöhnlich, unvergleichbar. aber der Anspruch, der an es gestellt wird, ist, für ein E-Game, derart runtergeschraubt, dass die Realität damit ja nur mithalten kann. Und: Wenn der Zeitvertreib nicht verglichen werden kann, wie soll man es dann in Relation stellen?

Die Liebelei ist nur auf den ersten Blick so komplex, beim 2. Durchspielen merkt man, dass die eigenen Entscheidungen gar keinen so großen Einfluss haben. Die Grafik ist mittelmäßig, und, das ist das schlimmste, es gibt zum größten Teile KEINE Vertonung.  Man sitzt also die meiste Zeit dort und ließt sich eine Stelle nach der anderen durch. Die elektronische Zerstreuung ist daher mehr ein Buch, als ein wirkliches E-Game. Wer sagt, klar, das gefällt, mir, gut, warum nicht. Dann muss man aber auch diesen Maßstab klar herausstellen.

Zu sagen, ein Spiel sei gut und ein Buch sei gut, spricht andere Vorlieben an. Solange und soweit dieser Aspekt nicht klar herausgestellt wird, wird es keine honorierbare, leidenschaftslose Kritik geben, sondern nur immer mehr oberflächliche Kritiken.

Nehmt euch das mal zu Herzen. ;-)"
Disco Elysium,Just bought this. Spent ten hours or so upto now and I've loved every second of it
Disco Elysium,"An IGN member playing a communist, how shocking!"
Disco Elysium,Refunded it after 15 mins. Absolute crap.

Disco Elysium,"Worst game ever, super difficult to understand."
Disco Elysium,"A great game, but the frequent loading screens really bog down the pacing. Every time you walk through a door prepare to wait 40 seconds to a minute. It’s something that should’ve been fixed."

Disco Elysium,"This is an absolutely beautiful game, you have to play it"

Disco Elysium,"And they gave Days Gone a 6,5..."
Disco Elysium,What's so special about this game? Looks like it takes a lot of reading and barely any gameplay at all.

Hollow Knight,This video doesn't contain any story spoilers.  Now gimme #silksong
Hollow Knight,Never played but i want to now.
Hollow Knight,"The first time I played this game I didn't like it because of how much it just seemed boring,I tried it again because a bunch of people in a reply section called it a masterpiece,now I'm addicted"
Hollow Knight,"7:03 Thats not a flaw for hollow knight. Its infamous for not having a proper tutorial, but it teaches you almost everything! The pogo ability you will most likely learn by finding one of the grubs in the forgotton crossroads. Unless you already have the wall climb or double jump, your only way up is to pogo off of floating platforms that are completely covered in spikes! And you will most likely learn you can pogo off of enemies by trying to hit downwards one day. The crystal heart (super dash) immediately teaches you how to use it by telling you the control and making your only way out by using it. After getting the mantis claw (wall climb), once again it tells you the control and your only way out is by using the wall climb. Then you have to do parkour with it, which teaches you that is has similar jumping mechanics as a regular jump does. Even the moth cloak (dash) you get from your first bossfight with Hornet, you immediately can use it to get over acid, and to reach a pile of Geo (ingame currency). Pretty much every ability is explained naturally. Monarch wings (double jump): have to use it to get out. Shade cloak? Immediately get to use it to get an artifact you were unable to reach on your way there. Howling wraiths? As you leave the building, 3 flying enemies to test it out on. Vengeful spirit? Immediately a boss you are forced to kill with. Desolate dive (ground slam)? Have to use it to get out. And Isma's tier you get surrounded by a pool of acid so you immediately see how it works. Hollow knight is truly amazing at giving information without ruining the atmosphere and vibe of the game"
Hollow Knight,"I usually speed through games and try to get all of the gameplay rather than emotional enjoyment, but evert once in a while, I feel like I have to slow down, relax, and enjoy hollow knight. I went from optimizing every super dash and double jump to just taking my time, practicing pogos, seeing if I can make a jump like this or like that, going to an area I've been putting off and getting a good bossfight (Galien in this case), even taking a moment to enjoy how awesome the Hive is. Hollow knight can cause even the most gameplay-crazy people like me to sit down and enjoy how good the game is!"
Hollow Knight,It is a phenomenal game. Unfortunately I had to put it away cuz I couldn't beat any bosses.   Sad
Hollow Knight,"I liked a lot of things about this game. The setting of the game, music and art style. But the game play and story (whatever that is) was so boring, after playing for about 4-5 hours I was so bored that I deleted this game. But to each their own."
Hollow Knight,"It’s 2023 I never played this game before. After putting over 500 hours into Elden ring, I decided to look through my library and found out. I actually downloaded this game on PlayStation plus when it was giving it away during their monthly change ups, decided to give it a try, and I definitely feel like I’m going to have an amazing ride with this one."
Hollow Knight,"Was great learning who you are on Side Scrollers today so checking out you videos. As someone who specializes in Metroidvanias, I’ve come back to this game like 3 times and I have to FORCE myself to play it. I don’t understand how everyone gushes over it so much. Nothing pulls me and after like 6 hours, I’ve still found no enjoyment from it. At some point I’m just going to power through and get through the game but I’m not looking forward to it. Where as on the other hand, when I first started playing the Ori games, I was INSTANTLY hooked after like 10 mins and couldn’t stop playing them. Ori and the Will of the Wisps IMO is the quintessential modern day Metroidvania."
Hollow Knight,"I know I’m really late, but you should play rain world"
Hollow Knight,"I'd argue the amount of backtracking has a secondary goal that's not really discussed, and that's memorization and refinement. 

Going back through the same tunnels teaches you on a subconscious layout where everything is, and how to move through it quicker and quicker with each new ability. 

What starts out with careful jumping from platform to platform becomes a borderline speedrun level of movement tech where you are jumping, jumping again, dashing against the wall, jumping and dashing.

Do it often enough, and you eventually do not even need the Wayward Compass because you know exactly what you're doing."
Hollow Knight,"I would just use the dream nail and leave a warp point near a travel cricket guy. 
 
That's the closest to fast travel you can do and it's really helpful."
Hollow Knight,Thank you.
Hollow Knight,no it isn't
Hollow Knight,like the music in this vid
Hollow Knight,Everytime I start playing shovel knight i remember hollow knight & i start playing hollow knight then i got my ass handed over to me & start playing shovel knight 😜😜😜😜
Hollow Knight,I can't think of another game that nails atmosphere the way HK did. I just love being in the game.
Hollow Knight,the music in this video is so beautiful. thank you for crediting it in the description. ❤ that city of tears cover by the consouls is just so striking to me. moved me to tears 😭❤🌧
Hollow Knight,man just dropped an absolute bar at 2:55
Hollow Knight,"u can get mega bored from this game easily, luckily the second time i played it, it clicked for me."
Hollow Knight,I mean during the times I where I had nothing was great cause I just explored and the map is the best thing ever. Being slow at the start let’s newer players be more comfortable with the game this is great.
Hollow Knight,Hi
Hollow Knight,"Just beat it with true ending and it has amazing music and graphics and environment with great explorations Truly perfect. Notice how I didn’t say Bosses, Combat and movement. It the weak point of the game and annoying. I can see why this game is a 8-10 out of 10. BUT I freaking hate this game, it’s so annoying and I hate boss fight in general. The last few bosses and the path of pain is headaches but people love that. Those type of people are really weirdddd fr fr …think about it. Bet they love being different lol Beat it after 50 hrs and did all bosses and DLC and I love exploring the map and seeing what next but whenever there a boss fight I roll my eyes. It either cheese 🧀 or just annoying. I would personally give it a 6/10. The bosses are the worse but give a lot of lore so people love that ugh I deleted this game immediately and will never touch it again. I did 100% or 106% just to say naww don’t play this game unless you like Darksoul games but casual turn away"
Hollow Knight,I got to play this one after I get Disco Elesium check that one out
Hollow Knight,"This is the game that I feel most guilty for bouncing on.

It made me feel insanely depressed."
Hollow Knight,"I find all the areas looking the same, so I do not feel anything when I tried this. Castlevania: Symphony of the Night however, now that I felt a whole lot with the different locations and the music."
Hollow Knight,Played it for over 5 hours and i dont get it why its so hyped by everyone..
Hollow Knight,I bought this game on sale tonight from PS. I've been playing it for about an hour. Enjoying it so far.
Hollow Knight,"Most of the games I consider perfect or a masterpiece are mainly driven by bias, not this one though, to me it's objectively a masterpiece even if chipped and cracked in its edges.

There are so many reasons to give why one would think so. Though for me, it's mainly because this game doesn't level up your character, not quite, it's one of the few that levels you up as a player. Accomplishing its challenges rewards you with multiple things if not for the satisfaction, it's maybe a charm, geo, a spell, or an upgrade. Its punishments are often fair, even if it can be hard, but unlike another modern example like Dark Souls, it respects your time and curiosity by giving you a proper breather, a chance to fight back and try again."
Hollow Knight,"So HK is the best game ever because of its atmosphere? Flimsy conclusion, at best."
Hollow Knight,Why do the charms I've purchased not show up in my inventory except for one? Playing on Nintendo Switch.
Hollow Knight,"Hollow knight legit made me change my view on games
In 2015-2019 i tought that hollow knight was bad because… I don’t even know
Then i gave it a try and i cried in the abyss"
Hollow Knight,"I love indy platformers, unique art styles, games that have a soul, the ones that pose a hard but fair challenge. I'm one of the biggest Celeste fans you'll ever meet and now that I need a break from Elden Ring after a good 300 hours I feel like I just discovered a little gem here. Can't wait to play this 🙂"
Hollow Knight,"Amazing review, just started getting into metrovenia and roguelite.

Starting H knight than hades.

Cant believe i dismised this type of games

Ty man! U got talent"
Hollow Knight,I hated that game :D idk
Hollow Knight,"hollow knight is so special to me, it isnt just my favourite videogame of all time, its my favourite *thing* of all time.
i struggle a lot with my own words and describing how i feel but you jumping straight into the city of tears entrance with quirrel at the bench feels like you took the words straight out of my mind. thank you for unintentionally giving me a way to explain why that moment is my favourite"
Hollow Knight,"Its ""RES ..SPITE"" ... you said res spit ... you absolute fool"
Hollow Knight,This video spoils so much shit.. like what?
Hollow Knight,Ori is a FAR better game in terms of gameplay.
Hollow Knight,"A boss/mini boss respawn point thing is the only complaint I have, or simply being able to choose which bench I want to respawn on. Other than that, I'm thoroughly enjoying my first 6 ish hours so far. Idk how long the game is supposed to take, but I'm clearly not very far along"
Hollow Knight,Of course the Hollow Knight is one of the games ever
Hollow Knight,I apologize for being rude to everyone in this conversation
Hollow Knight,"Loved this game, but it's one of those games where I'm tired of the Dark souls approach to story telling and vagueness in it's world's lore and timeline.  The showing tells little, and what is told is also too little."
Hollow Knight,#markipoo it's time for Hollow knight
Hollow Knight,Hollow Knight is such an masterpiece game and awesome video man :]
Hollow Knight,i resisted buying this game on my switch for so long. Then i just casually got it on an offer... it has blown my mind. what a beautiful game
Hollow Knight,Isn’t Tetris perfect?
Hollow Knight,Got to the first boss and gave up. The game is way to hard. Don't understand the hype.
Hollow Knight,Meh
Hollow Knight,"I loved Hollow knight but I was lost as it was my first metroidvania. and unfortunately spoiled a lot. 
Cant wait for Silksong because I am going to play it blind from start to finish"
Hollow Knight,It's garbage. One of the most annoying games I've ever played in my life.
Hollow Knight,"About what you said with the “hump” you have to get through at the start. I personally never had a problem with this, because even with limited movement the game gives you so much room to explore at the start and you’re too busy learning the forgotten crossroads and getting charms and finding the stag stations. I’m sure for some it can be a bit annoying, but as a person who is rarely patient if I’m not having fun with a game off the start, the game managed to set itself up so well I was too immersed to stop."
Hollow Knight,">One Of The Best Games Ever
>Metroidvania

pick one"
Hollow Knight,If y’all could go sub and watch EZdubs hollow knight videos that would be great! Just trying to get around 100 subs. Thanks!
Hollow Knight,"When I started playing this game I was in a very bad mental state. When I played it for the first time it was holidays. I wasnt at home with my very strong computer and instead played it on an old laptop. I was alone in a big room, only hearing the sound of rain and storm outside. And it was a truly magical week. I will never stop coming back to this game and for once not grinding and sweating but just walking through the world and enjoying it. Thank you Hollow Knight. You were one of a kind."
Hollow Knight,"over wordy intro, don't do this again, you aren't a writer"
Hollow Knight,"Looks great, I'll probably try it sometime. Love the shadows and selective use of lighting and the 2d hand-drawn aesthetic. If I'm being honest the ""chibi"" main character is the only reason I'm not excited to play it immediately. Don't like that cutesy stuff in a main character at all. I do love Studio Ghibli which seems to be an inspiration for the style but even in like Princess Mononoke you have alternating scenes of gritty aesthetic horror along with the chibi forest spirits, you don't have the chibi style on screen the entire time."
Hollow Knight,I can't wait to go into Silksong blind. Excellent overview of Hollow Knight!
Hollow Knight,I'm so excited for silksong man... I have really enjoyed a few metroidvanias since like Blasphemous and Ender Lillies none have been as amazing as HK
Hollow Knight,Still my favorite game of all time.
Hollow Knight,Awesome review! I love this game to bit’s and so many difficult yet rewarding challenges in this game. It’s a must play for anyone who likes a challenge.
Hollow Knight,"Best game I picked up for free from PS plus, I knew nothing about it and ended up loving it!"
Hollow Knight,"I gave Hollow Knight another go, because of your video. Game is amazing. So many times we judge a game after 5-10 minutes and we miss out on gems like this one. Keep up the good work. All the best."
Hollow Knight,"this game is my favorite, it gave so much to me i can never give it back, its such a lore deep game, and its so beautiful, and it is much much more than a game, i always loved the game, it always pleased me, it gave me friends, this community, and the game itself is just awesome, people saying its one of their favorite games is an understatement! its the best game ive ever played! the music was always a masterpiece, and the art is sooo great. its also very hard, and i find it hard that people estimate 21 hours for a run and 42 hours for the full game, i finished the true ending and everything in 84 hours, its such a great game i just have to say that again, and i wont lie, im a complete hollow knight stan, but its reasonable. team cherry is such gigachads, and i want SILKSONG"
Hollow Knight,"I've beaten this game several times and it's my favorite game ever. I helped Kickstart it, and I've bought 4 copies of the game (on Steam for me, on Steam for a friend, digital on Switch and physical on Switch). 
Yet here I am watching another review for it as though I'm deciding whether to give it a try or not 😄"
Hollow Knight,<3
Hollow Knight,I had to order it. It's always sold out here. And found out the mail is delayed. I'm biting at the teeth to play this. I bought blue fire. Kinda like Zelda meets hollow knight but I'll bet anything it's not good as this
Hollow Knight,"..a perfect example of how visual spectacle and the sense of supreme production quality doesn't even mean that the game needs to be 3D, let alone require a ""gaming pc"""
Hollow Knight,Hollow knight was one of the only games that I actually wanted to 100% and tell me why the hollow knight was the only boss in the game I 1st attempted
Hollow Knight,"Hollow knight is genuinely one of the best games ever made.
OHh HOW I hope that silksong is just as good! D:"
Hollow Knight,Which is the other game you'd consider a great indie masterpiece of our time?
Hollow Knight,"I think the boss runs should be basically the way they are. Proving yourself again and again is part of the game. And even if it is annoying for some bosses, its not every single boss, and some run-backs are particularly easy. Dream bosses dont have any run back whatsoever. So having that difference between different bosses makes the whole world more dynamic. If every boss had a run back of two hallways and lasts exactly 7.5 seconds to make everything streamlined, it would be “better” for fighting the boss over and over, but it would be less interesting, predictable, and forced. As in, the developers are bending what the world is naturally to fit into preconceived “game” mechanics. Instead of world dynamics. 

Idk if that makes as much sense as i think it does. But i think that the whole experience benefits from having some things be obnoxious"
Hollow Knight,It’s not
Hollow Knight,This game gets so much love and I've tried to get into it but I just can't. I can admit it's a good game but it's just not for me. It's crazy bc I love other games like this but this one just doesn't do it for me.
Hollow Knight,"This made me want to give the game a new chance. I played it for a couple of hours and just didn't get what everyone was raving about. Only exploring action game I dropped along with Axiom Verge 2 (such an immense  letdown after the original which I hold as one of the best and most atmospheric expaction games ever). 

Mayne I'll like Hollow Knight better this time around."
Hollow Knight,The anor londo reference with Quirrel in  in the beginning is another little detail I love. The game pushes the camera just far enough for you to see the reference <3
Hollow Knight,This game is as close to perfect as I have ever played for a metroidvania.
Hollow Knight,"Praise to Tonald Loke our Lord and saviour.

Blessed be the don"
Hollow Knight,"Except for the fact that I went to the mine area at a point i was not supposed to, now i cat get out, i am stuck and i can't progress with 10 hours into the game. 

Tried to find solutions and apparently the only one is to use a Speedrun trick memorizing a dark area full of insects and platforms... Terrible design"
Hollow Knight,"i’m new to the game and am in a fairly early stage, i wish that they had a frameskip toggle option. i don’t have the best laptop, so the (rare) lag can end up costing me a boss battle"
Hollow Knight,"Hollowknight is an amazing and beautiful game that does have a barrier to entry in the form of a skill check early on.

 Its well worth mastering and pushing through though. lm glad i completed this game its a master piece, cant wait for silksong. 

If you have finished HK like me theres a hand full of similar games that you may like also . Just do some research."
Hollow Knight,"I've just finished replaying it with a friend on his first run ever. This game will never cease to amaze me, the Hollow Knight's backstory is incredibly touching and the whole lore is so well presented. It's really one of the best games I've ever played."
Hollow Knight,Good video. Re-listening to your appearance on EFAP. Would love to see you on there again some day
Hollow Knight,"It’s the best game of all time imo. The first playthrough was so magical that I couldn’t stop thinking about it for weeks. Great video.

10:06 you make a great point here, which I definitely agree with. Practically all my favourite games ever share the same concept, which is that they handhold extremely minimally and mostly just let you go do your thing. Dark Souls 1, Factorio, Hollow Knight, Oldschool Runescape, Geometry Dash, Call of Duty zombies, Dead Cells, etc."
Hollow Knight,"Hollow Knight is amazing


Blasphemous better"
Hollow Knight,"I first learned how to pogo hop in path of pain cause I saw it was literally impossible and looked it up.

Also I've never once quick cast. I did all Bindings pantheons every Radiant difficulty fight and steel soul never knew that was a thing."
Hollow Knight,That crossroads ost is like freebasing nostalgia
Hollow Knight,Ok but like why dreamshield
Hollow Knight,Why is this the best game ever? Cause they nailed it!
Hollow Knight,I genuinely believe that Hollow Knight is the best game ever created. A true 10/10 masterpiece.
Hollow Knight,Downward thrust I just subscribed off your destiny 2 video if your looking for a good inclusive community division 2 has the best one
Hollow Knight,"In relation to the comment on the music, my friend is very prone to sensory overload and gets overwhelmed easily. When I showed them the game for the first time, one of their first comments was that the music was incredibly relaxing."
Hollow Knight,"I am a simple man - I see a well-made video praising Hollow Knight, I watch and leave a like."
Hollow Knight,It's too cartoony for me. I tried to like it but it reminds me of some cartoon network series. I think both Ori games do a better metroidvania by leaps and bounds- but that's just my opinion.
Hollow Knight,Great video! I realized I miss your “did it fail?” series.
Hollow Knight,"that poem man 2:58 to 3:10 
i immedtaily subscribed"
Hollow Knight,"This video is pog, Lord Tone.

For real though this video is awesome. You make some really good points of praise and especially criticism. You didn’t dwell on anything for too long and the neat little bow at the end was awesome. Please don’t rush but definitely make more like this man!"
Hollow Knight,I started playing but I quit. Gave it another try and wow I'm happy I gave it another try.
Hollow Knight,"I beat hollow knight not sure what all the hype is games ok it's not that great upgrade system sucks... what awsome I got a new way to jump.. what cool i got a new way to dash... no way another way to jump.. this next one has to be better nope another way to dash lol games cool just not that cool. The visuals, bosses and levels are pretty dope but it was lack luster in my opinion"
Hollow Knight,Best game of all time cant wait for silksong
Furi,"6.8, huh Git gud"
Furi,Carpenter Brut made the sound track btw.
Furi,Why do they give woman like this to review games ?
Furi,How IGN so consistently gives such inaccurate reviews is  almost a miracle!
Furi,Women should not be allowed to review video games.
Furi,This game is a 10/10
Furi,"with reviews like these i'm sill wondering why people are watching reviews especially IGN 
moral of the story is don't trust anyone trust your own experience"
Furi,issue of skill
Furi,WTF IGN GODDAMN
Furi,Truly a bad review
Furi,Half a hour to beat a boss?how high was she?also the counter system is close to flawless
Furi,"Modern big budget titles have left many gamers feeling fatigued. No matter how many features you throw into the most recent FPS, everything starts to feel very similar to the last game you played. You can throw 100 different elements of gameplay, story or design onto one disk, but it all starts to feel like a chore if none of these elements feel “fun”."
Furi,"Who else clicks on IGN reviews just for the inevitable mockery in the comments section? 😂
If that's not the point of IGN video reviews these days then I've lost touch."
Furi,Prime example of why video game journalists are a joke
Furi,They had a hit picking this game they had a miss letting her do the review. 😂
Furi,"""Fun to frustrating"" you're literally just bad at the game shut up"
Furi,Shittiest IGN review
Furi,Honest title: Woman reviews game she can't git gud at
Furi,at last ign is consistent in their bad reviews..
Furi,"This video has more dislikes than likes, and that does put a smile on my face"
Furi,"The parry mechanic is literally the easiest in any game I've every played, it literally makes a ding sound and flashes white when you should parry."
Furi,Do the people who write these reviews play game? The game was challenging but really not that hard.
Furi,What a pathetic review
Furi,"Jesus


Edit : 666th comment"
Furi,"Chloi, get gud."
Furi,6.8/10 doesnt make you feel like spiderman
Furi,10/10 this review is buns
Furi,Yet games lacking creativity like cod always get praised by the ign overlords
Furi,Lol corporate review
Furi,Easily 8.9
Furi,they didnt give us money or early acces 6.8/10
Furi,I’d give this a 9 and I’ve beat the star
Furi,"Crip clean combat, a bangin' soundtrack, and a fresh take on bullet hell games = 10 parries/10 parries"
Furi,This chick sounds exactly like my friend who tried furi once and just died over and over... pssh
Furi,git gud ign
Furi,Garbage review. This game is great. But it's just not for everybody.
Furi,"""this game is so hard omg i give it a 6,8,due to me being so bad at hard games"" ign be like

i played this game this year,bought it with a sale, i loved it and had a super fun time playing it, done furier difficulty and s ranked the furi story mode, this reviewer is a bit of a casual don't you think?"
Furi,I fell like this is asuras wrath but a bit hotline miami-ish
Furi,"2:10
""Parrying feels inconsistent"" yeah she's a game journalist of course she's bad."
Furi,Came here for the comments
Furi,"A 6.8? Bro what do you mean? While ign over here saying it was a SHOT. Personally I think it would’ve SLICED through the competition.
PARRY those puns! For real get SNIPED ign."
Furi,*my shitty gaming skills have entered the chat...*
Furi,I'm glad they fired her. She pretty much gave this game a low score for being bad. Karma 🤷‍♂️
Furi,ign you have broken my heart
Furi,"The parry is the most consistent mechanic in the game, you’re just bad"
Furi,Did they really play this game on furi mode and still complain about the game being frustrating?
Furi,"6.8? Seriously?  Did you get the plot? Have you ever played challenging games? I mean, wtf ign? Next time give a game to someone who can play and understand the genre. Unsubscribing right now."
Furi,The parry feels inconsistent. WHAT?!
Furi,this girl gave a 9/10 to pubg
Furi,Why is there a girl who is terrible at video games reviewing this game 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Furi,I rate this review an IGN/10
Furi,See in my opinion the part they went wrong here was when they gave furi a 6.8
Furi,It’s frustrating that’s for sure.
Furi,One of the best video game soundtracks ever made.
Furi,IGN and their masterful reviewing skills
Furi,"She's a tech 'recruiter' now, keep trying sweetheart lol"
Furi,I really dont like IGN reviews anymore...
Furi,"There's a massive influx of ill educated comments in here that bashes the criticisms of the controls when in reality the game suffers from wonky hitboxes and the dodge+ parry mechanics aren't up to par with what the game tries to accomplish. The game will often straight up ignore your input and your character will -still- take damage despite you either having blocked the attack or dodged it.
I took the liberty to do some frame by frames to see if i was right, i was, and back when i had them up people still refused to see it because they subscribed to the typical fan mentality where no aspect of their current fascination could possibly be wrong which is the root of why so many modern games get away with poor programming a million times worse than this."
Furi,"Dude this game is easily a 9, it has its flaws but they are pretty minor. IGN has no capability to play hard video games."
Furi,"Easily a 9. Even with everything, ignore is still wrong"
Furi,The Dislikes are more than likes . This explains everything
Furi,Not even gonna mention the charge mechanic for gun play and melee? Okay ign
Furi,"I'm bad at this game 
6.8/10"
Furi,"IGN: on a scale from 1 to 10, Furi is an 11, and I’d give it a 6.8."
Furi,I need to go on record with everyone else here against IGN: get gud scrub.
Furi,I hear an awful review......pitter patter.
Furi,?ⓣⓗⓘⓢ ⓜⓐⓨ ⓟⓡⓞⓥⓔ ⓣⓞ ⓑⓔ ⓐⓝ ⓤⓝⓟⓞⓟⓤⓛⓐⓡ ⓞⓟⓘⓝⓘⓞⓝ
Furi,"""I guess they never miss, huh"" - IGN"
Furi,Coming back to laugh at you.
Furi,Sounds like you're just really bad at the game
Furi,"""tHis gaMe iS tOo hArd""
-IGN"
Furi,Not often I agree with the gamer community but you’re all spot on here about the score for this game. Deserved to be higher.
Furi,I like how this review doesn't mention graphics or story
Furi,"You Ma’am, I would have to disagree as this game needs patterns that’s the whole point! And mixed with the incredible EDM sound track is a gratified mesmerizing, satisfying game. Entering into “flow” and the timing of buttons to counter and the challenge results in a great game!"
Furi,"This game falters on not giving upgrades to anything, just by beating a boss is not enough give me a new blade, a new ninja suit, something to look forward too but stress ."
Furi,Oof
Furi,"I call faie review, this game is easily a 9. This game is all about understanding the mechanics of the game. Yo dont know how to plauy."
Furi,Is this your actual review?
Furi,This is one of my favourite games ever. Addictive soundtrack!
Furi,The parry works fine if you concentrate on the sound que instead of the visual que. Its a fine game if you get it on sale or with Orign acess via EA. Its just not worth 19 euro.
Furi,"""On a scale from 1 to 10 this game is an 11, and it'd give itself a 12."""
Furi,6.8? wtf..
Furi,Horrid review. Not indicative of the product’s actual worth and excellence.
Furi,"I honestly disagree with the score because of a few reasons. 

1.i found that the boss design was honestly great it really went well with the whole futuristic synth feel, I can sort of agree with the scripted sequences except for the fact that these animations only show up, up to 5 times in a battle which gets a little stale and I wish there was more than one animation but the stick moving parts suffice for that and it changes depending on which boss.

2. I feel like “going through the motions” is not a correct way to describe a boss fight, as there are many ways to take on attacks for example when a boss shoots at you you can parry the shot, dash through it or shoot it to negate the shot, of course your choice of what to do can depend on what type of shot is coming at you but that’s the general idea, for a bosses slashes you can dodge or parry the slashes and finally when there is an up close battle scene and the boss does a wide slash you can dodge it but you can also attack him then parry his next attack. My point is there are different ways to approach a battle it’s just that you used the tactics that made the most sense compared to dashing away from a move that you can parry. Also the parries are pretty spot on it just depends on the speed of the boss.

For what you complained about furi did not deserve a score as low as 6.8. 

(Sorry if my sentences where inconsistent, I just went on a rant I didn’t write an essay)"
Furi,Go play Kirby epic yarn
Furi,This game is better than that.
Furi,They don't call it a boss for nothing
Furi,I just finished this game and it's really incredible. I dont know where this reviewer is coming from with her criticisms. It's almost like she hasn't played other games before.
Furi,This game was a solid 9 for me
Furi,This is the worst review I've seen on this game by far.
Furi,"No,no.The game is great maybe 8.5-9 but its cool"
Furi,IGN needs to git gud
Furi,"Clicks on video, goes to a random part of it
Hears that the parring mechanic is inconsistant
Exits video"
Furi,"Other than what she says about parrying, her points are, while not completely valid, at least understandable.
However, even with it's flaws, Furi is no way below an 8.0 imho. It's just sad to see all the love and care that went into making this game(which is SO clear in everything) be so underappreciated because the reviewer was probably not so good at playing it :("
Furi,video game reviewers should be good at video games
Furi,IGN has no idea what they are talking about
Furi,Why did i even wait for this review to pop up...when i could just look at Giant Bomb...Dunkey was right
Furi,I’m upset because it’s hard -ign
Furi,"I think it says a lot how IGN who can’t handle a challenge harder than pong have this game a 6.8 while Yahtzee, who hates every game ever made other than a select few called this the second best game of the year. Really makes you think"
Furi,"This game is an 8 at least, it's also rewarding when you beat a boss"
Furi,I love this game so difficult though😅
Furi,"Unlike IGN, this guy truly understands the concepts of furi"
Furi,"Eh, disagreed on this one. I'm tired of bosses that force you to sit there and eat their stuff, even if you're whirlwind of protag death because the devs arbitrarily told you so. Also, bosses can sometimes start committing to an attack but then snap out of it and go defensive or dodge you when you go for a punish... it's all just too arbitrary and unintuitive for me to be excited about. It's like the devs are trolling you and would rather give the boss ""cheats"" than let the player hit them and be done with them sooner or easier than they intended.

I got to 5 phases into the Strap fight and I quit. I don't mind a challenge but the game makes a habit of forcing me to replay mundane sections just to get to the harder parts. I'm not about that, so I'm out."
Furi,I Have Played Furi
Furi,"I think the bosses have a lot of symbolism towards The Rider facing his troubles I will explain why.

The Chain: Probably the sadistic part of Rider which he used to have before being locked up after being sent on a mission.

The Strap: What Rider could have became if he didn't get help by the Voice.

The Line: Riders questions about himself if it is worth it to keep going and questions his own identity.

The Scale: Perhaps the revenge nature of Rider of what he want's to improve or destroy depending on what ending.

The Hand: The determination and will power Rider faces to obtain and reasoning to fight, which is to be free.

The Song: Fighting to obtain forgiveness towards this world that isn't his or destroying the forgiveness.

The Burst: Destroying the fact that killing ""is a game"" and removing the ego from himself.

The Edge: Not fighting because he is evil or good, but fighting because he has to including improving as a person.

The Beat: Both being confused on why they are here and lost perhaps being controlled by something bigger.

The Flame: Destroying the horrible past and pain to move on and finish off the mission.

The Star: Ending the thing that caused world domination and being controlled as a person giving Rider real freedom.

The Voice: The mind of The Rider to convince that there is trust and good people in this world he is fighting in.

I generally think Furi is a hell of an underrated game and it is well constructed as a boss rush game just really thankful to experience this game thank you game baker studios!"
Furi,RAGE quit after 4 boss only needs Parry... fcking another dark soul type game man ı was so exited to play this beacuse od soundtrack and dissopinting me like kena bridge of spirits ... stop making souls game pls fcking anooyiny
Furi,The last part is why I love challenging games. They push you beyond your limits and it's fun to improve yourself.
Furi,Reminds me of El Shaddai.
Furi,The angel and the old monk were so difficult.
Furi,"My favorite part of the combat was deliberately hitting a boss at the wrong time to provoke an attack, parrying it, and dealing a ton of damage"
Furi,Furi is similar to Gitaroo man.
Furi,i got an S rank in furier *dabs*
Furi,furi is epic
Furi,Wait.. not worth to parry in Dark Souls? Git Gud and its an easy task to parry.
Furi,This> Ign Review
Furi,"I lOVE this game, but fuck the sniper lady. What was everyone's favorite boss? I am curious"
Furi,Stoped time... *NEVER AGAAAAAAIN* !!!
Furi,I love the gameplay in this game but the graphics leave a whole lot to be desired and the soundtrack is really not my thing. I like the game tho
Furi,"God i dislike this game and don't get why so many people love it. The annoying narrator, lousy animation, bad character models, the fact that the only real gameplay is 8 boss battles and the rest is walking, boss battles going on for way longer than they need, the writing overall being bad,, wonky hitboxes.. i really think this game is a 6 at best."
Furi,"On that dark souls parry comment, the snake men aren’t exactly easy to parry. Only SOME of their attacks can be parried. Aside from that, not a bad review at all"
Furi,Good review. i like it :)
Furi,I remember finishing furier old man boss I have never buss such a hard mental nutt in my life
Furi,FINALLY SOMEONE TALKING ABIUT FURI
Furi,Dark Souls parrying is really easy once you have the enemy attack patterns down
Furi,will there ever be a furi 2? what do i play nowwww?
Furi,I think I've never played a Boss-game...
Furi,“None of these adversaries are pushovers” beside The Pushover (The Beat)
Furi,This is my favorite series of videos
Furi,"definetly one of my 20 favorite games of all time, played it until i got every achievement and like 45 mins in speedrun haha obsesive me xd"
Furi,Look at what they did to you
Furi,*Trash normie can't parry in dark souls.*
Furi,"I picked it up for my Switch during the last sale and it was overall satisfying.  The walking part and the last “optional” boss, however, were disappointing.  The end credit scene before the final fight and cutscene was much more memorable to me.

Anyway, I’m glad that I played this game.  The soundtracks were especially phenomenal :)"
Furi,3:00 HMMMMM...
Furi,But I'm not a furri
Furi,2:48 if you suck
Furi,Isn't this a game about furries?
Furi,The concept of enemy attack patterns is similar to the touhou franchise
Furi,both the main character design and his abilitys remind me of hyper light drifter
Furi,Is this Sam from node?
Furi,Wow this reviewer 🔥🔥🔥
Furi,"The secret final boss, on Furier... that took me a while. It was the damned fourth phase, I tell you! Hit once, and you just get caught in the vortex with no chance to whittle down her (it's?) health bar at all, and there's hardly room to dodge. Finally beating it was about the happiest damned moment of my recent life, haha.

Speedrun time's still only like, 51 minutes currently, but oh well. It's nice to see the game's getting recognition."
Furi,0:52 Is... Is that a human Glados? On a wheel?
Furi,I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVE FURI!!!!!!!
Furi,"I’m just gonna add how for dark souls, parrying the snake men is crap because yes your CAN parry them but only SOME of their attacks. Parrying is not all that bad in dark souls for the most part once you learn how it works. Furi gives you a signal when to parry so I’d argue that it’s easier when it comes to parrying"
Furi,i swear to god furis margin of error for parry is literally 1 millisecond. fucking impossible
Furi,"You can also fit in a few blaster shots before you activate the perfecrt parry cutscene thing.

There's so many little extra things you can do to make fights go faster.

Also, furier is the way the game was intended to be played, think of furier as the true game."
Furi,Did... you just call The Beat challenging? I see...
Furi,Guess I have to play furi again...
Furi,Each trophy was worth in this game and after platinum i am very satisfied and yeah i am bragging.
Furi,"I would say the dark souls parry works well for that game, but it's not something that would work everywhere."
Furi,"i'm sold, i've been wanting to play a shoot em up or a boos rush game, even though i've heard of furi i never knew it was either of those genres"
Furi,"I played this when I heard ""Youre mine"" by carpenter brut, who also did the hotline Miami soundtrack. So yeah I enjoyed this game"
Furi,Really considering getting Furi for my switch
Furi,For a little while i thought the game was called furry
Furi,Still better than IGN
Furi,It’s coming to switch so definitely going to get it.
Furi,I'm stuck in the fourth boss
Furi,"lol darksouls parry doesnt have that much of a precise timing at all
just press the button when you would get hit"
Furi,dark souls is trash
Furi,YOU need to play Monster Hunter Worlds (when  it comes out)
Furi,Love this game. It's samurai Jack meets Tron. And man does it have teeth!
Furi,"I love unique bullet hell games, most bullet hell games are set up where you just use a spaceship or something and you only have to dodge projectiles while autofire does the rest of the work for you, but i love games like Furi, Enter the Gungeon, Nuclear Throne, and Nier Automata(btw you should do a you need to play Nier Automata, because Nier Automata is fantastic)"
Furi,"I tried to like it, but the pacing was off and the controls were laggy as fsck. Really wanted something as tight controls-wise as Hyper Light Drifter or Nier: Automata. Shame, because the music in this game is a-MA-zing."
Furi,I loved Titan souls :(
Furi,"""None of the bosses are pushovers."" Except the one that doesn't attack."
Furi,"*finishes game on Furi difficulty*
""Oh God I actually survived everything""
*Plays on Furier*
""Kill me, kill me now""

Gotta git gud"
Furi,"""None of these adversaries are pushovers""








The Beat :'("
Furi,"Snoman, YOU need to play Cloudbuilt if you haven't already. It's like if Mirror's Edge had a baby with F-Zero and Megaman. It is also not for the faint of heart or easily angered."
Furi,"WHOA! You mean Furi had a new game plus? Yeah that and many other games give you ""twice the game for one!"""
Furi,Instant spoiler for those who want to play it.
Furi,CAn u suggest other games like furi...just completed it :P
Furi,Furi is ok I guess I don't like it to much....
Furi,I got this for free on PS+ and I haven't booted it up yet. Thanks for showing me what to expect! I'll get on it soon.
Furi,story just sucks balls
Furi,Just don't become furi(badum-tsh. Kill me)
Furi,Does anyone else think The Voice is a reference to Frank from Donnie Darko?
Furi,"""In dark souls the timing has to be so precise to the point where it's not worth trying."" Wat"
Furi,So Yasuo got his own video game... cool!
Furi,I need help on that sniper bitch any tips
Furi,The gameplay kinda looks like a 3D Hyper Light Drifter mixed with a bullet hell and a little more gun usage and boss heavy. Even the protagonists' fashion senses are similar. Not sure which one came out first.
Furi,You need to try LBX.
Furi,"I'm watching a lot of your video's, as i am makeing a game myself.  

these video's really help me understand what is good, and no so good about certian genra's"
Furi,This series always seems to deliver for me! Loved the game!
Furi,">unable to parry in darksouls
You know the meme bruva.
seriously demonsouls, DS1 easy parry"
Furi,Did anyone get to the secret boss fight at the end?
Furi,"I bought this game during the winter sale and had a great time beating the first couple of bosses, then the sniper boss really frustrated me after a couple of instant deaths so I stopped playing. Today I found this video and decided to give it another try. I had a blast again and beat the boss first try. Thx for encouraging me not letting the game catch dust in my steam library."
Furi,what is the game shown in the upper left corner starting at 0:20?
Furi,"you should make a ""You Need To Play Rivals of Aether"
Furi,"You would love caveblazers, a currently early access rougelike. I got it a long time ago and wow. I think it is better than spelunky."
Furi,furry?
Furi,"the only problem i found in this game is, it is or SUPER FUCKING HARD, or SUPER FUCKING EASY, and if you go to easy you cant go back to hard"
Furi,If you had ps+ it was a free game a while ago.
Furi,"Didnt know that Furi is such an interesting game! I got it for free on playstation plus so I overlooked it quickly, cause free games there they aren´t good normally. Thanks for opening my eyes. Keep up the great work!"
Furi,"Ehh, the combat design felt boring and uninspired. Melee boils down mostly to parry parry attack, and sometimes dodge. Though you never have to dodge in melee if you attack them while they do a cone attack until they do their easy to parry attacks. So melee is mostly parry parry attack, and you can charge your next attack if you have enough time. So deep. Gunplay is really awful, with the high pitched sound of the gun lacking impact, and the muzzle velocity, single hit damage, and fire rate of the projectiles being pathetic, mediocre, and unremarkable. Charge attacks don't solve this issue as they are mostly situational, and for some reason there are situations where the boss will not dodge your low muzzle velocity normal shots but will dodge your higher velocity charge shots.
The most legitimately fun part of the game was that dodging the enemy attacks in bullet hell style was challenging and fun. But without the good gunplay or melee combat, there is not much else to do. And the boss designs cannot be good if the core mechanics don't lend themselves to any amount of depth. I kinda liked the second boss and the sniper lady because they felt the most unique with the exception that the master of time was unique but also drawn out and frustrating, but the rest of the bosses were mostly mediocre."
Furi,Can you please be a Steam curator?
Furi,this game is an unreal level of hard.
Furi,Still proud that I got the platinum trophy on Playstation.
Furi,sad that they rip off the entire figthing mechanics from hyper light drifter
Furi,"Metal gear Rising +Afro samurai.
I HAVE TO PLAY IIIITTT!"
Furi,Furries
The Case of the Golden Idol,I def prefer this game over the return of the obra dinn. Didn't really like the flow of that game given you have to go through so much and you are easily prone to missing a small detail that essentially might solve multiple issues in your logic
The Case of the Golden Idol,I hope you've played Obra Dinn since this. Great review!
The Case of the Golden Idol,"Great game, I want more! Luckily I haven't played Obra Dinn yet, so that's my next stop 👌"
The Case of the Golden Idol,"Great review. Like you say, the trailers have a hard time really showing what the game is about, and there really aren't many reviews out there."
The Case of the Golden Idol,"Thanks for spotlighting this and for the great review, added to my wishlist"
The Case of the Golden Idol,This was already on my list but it's moving up a few places now!
The Case of the Golden Idol,"The mystery and detective work is you, the player, putting together the story as you uncover the pieces of the puzzle.
The story unfolds linearly, but the mystery is player understanding how you got there and why.
A detective finds a body, and their job is to put together the story to create the narrative. That's what the game is.
The player is just an omniscient detective who has no part of the story itself."
The Case of the Golden Idol,"So from what I get from this is that there's a (loose) distinction between 'solving a mystery', which is characterised by the freedom to creatively and non-linear-ly work your way towards answering a central question, and between a puzzle game, which is built on completing tasks and puzzles in the order the game goads you to do, which is a bit like assembling an IKEA shelf.
And the fascinating thing is that I feel the opposite way to you. To me, there was no mystery solving in the Obra Dinn, but there was in the Golden Idol. (And I enjoyed both of these games massively). I think it all comes down to your individual way of playing the game and taking it up on its invitations to consider the plot.
I didn't engage with the 'mystery' of the fate of the Obra Dinn and its shipmates, I was busy playing a series of Guess Who and Spot the Knife while following the predetermined path to unlock more cool panoramas to look at, which all felt surprising and unconnected except for them being part of some domino chain or string of bad luck. The 'mystery' to me was only lore, something I could optionally contemplate after the end.
I find that with the Case of the Golden Idol something similar happened whenever I focused to much on filling out the scroll and primarily relying on it for my thought process, letting it predetermine every step I take. But other than with the Obra Dinn, in this game it rather sucked out some of the enjoyment of it. But the rest of the time I really was taken in with trying to wrap my head around the scenarios and the central mystery, the mystery of what secret strings are being pulled behind the scenes, which I especially felt invited to by the game because of the connections popping up, promising to make every episode make more sense and to uncover extra secrets, and not least by being asked to recontextualize things and think of the bigger picture in order to progress.
Also, from watching my s.o. play the game (and the DLC) after I completed it, I could also witness how it was possible to use different set of clues, different approaches and areas of focus, which emboldens me in my sense that there is a creative deduction process within the episodes, though from experience it seems to feel more easily like it if you bring out your notes, put on your (metaphysical) detective hat and orient yourself around your own set of questions (motive, method, lies&truth, accomplice?) to make sense of the murders."
The Case of the Golden Idol,"Although I understand the point the video is trying to make, the game still has too many detective elements for it not to be labeled a detective game. You have to find clues and establish motive to solve a murder. You have to use deductive reasoning and logic. You have to remove any preconceived assumptions and biases you may have and see the case from different angles. But do I agree that it is very unlike what a real detective would face: for instance the danger of chasing suspects, recognizing lies when interviewing people and finally presenting evidence. There is a bit of an anti-climax here: in a traditional detective scenario the suspect is put to justice. But here, you just go to the next part in the story. Those are just one part of the detective experience though, and though I would agree the experience here is not complete, I wouldn't blame anyone for the mislabeling. Especially when no alternative label has been suggested, not even by the author of this video. It's the same argument as roguelite vs rougelike, except there we actually have two different definitions"
The Case of the Golden Idol,The game is fun enough but you can solve the problem with just brute force without deduction
The Case of the Golden Idol,super close on diegesis! the diegesis is the world that the story takes place in so elements that exist in that world are called diegetic
The Case of the Golden Idol,"Can anyone recommend a game similar to this? 
I’ve played obra dinn, immortality and her story too and loved those"
The Case of the Golden Idol,"It's like claiming youre a detective in Escape Room simulator games... Sometimes you are! You're solving WHY you're there! But usually, it's just the Getting Out of the game that's the goal...?
Did that make any sense? 😅"
The Case of the Golden Idol,"Oh, shit! I've actually played Unpacking!!! Wow!
A friend owned it and let me play it a couple years ago 😅"
The Case of the Golden Idol,"I understand your point of view and I don't mean to paint not being a detective game as some sort of besmirchment but I would still be hard pressed to classify The Case of the Golden Idol as anything but a detective game. I think we just have different points of view as I don't think you need to be specifically tasked to find things out to be considered a detective. I think the unique thing with this one is that by ignoring proper framing for the scenarios, you simply progress through it to discover a sense of what's happening. It doesn't play like you are trying to reveal the secrets of the idol but rather the journey the object went on. A lot of the ambivalence others have can be completely dissolved with the idea that the idol recorded all the deaths it was in the vicinity of and you are interpreting the images. You are looking through history and deciphering the meaning of things until the epilogue where you can confidently state what occurred. It's like putting an ancient pot back together without knowing what it looked like originally or even what parts are the pot and which parts are something else. Or in this case, it's like finding an abandoned camera and combing through the scenes to paint a picture of what occurred. Anything obscured can be seen as a mystery with the right mindset. I would say Cultist Simulator acts as a fantastic detective game and that one starts with absolutely no information at all. The term is just a way to describe what skills we're using to obtain the goal. The key is your curiosity and satisfaction of solving the narrative acting as the driving force to continue."
The Case of the Golden Idol,I just played through the game because of your video and I got stuck on the last case for literally 3 hours because I didn't connect who the guy's real identity was. I found out AFTER I already solved the last case because the guy HIMSELF said it in the epilogue case and I felt so stupid
The Case of the Golden Idol,"I enjoyed The Case of the Golden Idol. I played it solely due to it's similarity to Obra Dinn. But even since playing the demo a few months back, I knew it couldn't compare to Obra Dinn, even though it tried to. And the reason is, I believe, there will never be a game that _can_ compare to The Return of the Obra Dinn. Because Lucas Pope is an artist. The game is a piece of art, and a masterpiece at that. I'ts not perfect, but it is a masterpiece nonetheless. Lucas Pope invented a whole new way of storytelling, forcing the player to backtrack the events, criss-crossing across time, putting the story whole, piece by piece. And the way he presented it, in a monochrome 3D diorama is unlike anything ever seen before. On his blog, or in an interview (I cant remember) he mentioned he wanted the _Memento Mortem_ to be whole scenes played out, fully animated and whatnot, but he ran into technical limitations. And he took those limitations and made it so the scene was just a single still frame, and it's so much better this way. The video game aspect of Obra Dinn is plain and simple, but there's so much more underneath that you can't look at it any other way than like a piece of art. Not to mention the score! 
And I'm not saying there are no other artist video game creators like him. There are plenty games like Obra Dinn that are pieces of art. But none of them are of similar scope. Also, there will probably be more games utilizing the diorama-deductive mechanics, but they will not have the same effect on the player. Because if someone develops a game from copying the mechanics, trying to capture the feel of another medium, they aren't expressing _themselves._
Also, I'm certain next game from Lucas Pope will be at least half as amazing as Obra Dinn. I'm also certain it will be nothing like Obra Dinn, or Papers, Please for that matter. And I'm waiting for it excitedly."
The Case of the Golden Idol,"Great review (which I say as someone who loved CotGI). For me, I felt like a ""history detective"". The game follows a timeline of, what, roughly 40-50 years? I felt like a researcher trying to follow the trajectory of this idol and understand its impact on this community, like some Lovecraft protagonist pouring over documents at Arkham Library before a racist cat comes in. 

It also reminded me of growing up playing strange passion project games in the late 80s and early 90s. A lot of those games just had some central mechanic and no ""wrap around"" world of characters and motivations. I kind of liked being a disembodied investigator moving through pure UI. I wouldn't love it for a 30 hour game, but for a 6 hour cozy deduction game, it was a nice change of pace."
The Case of the Golden Idol,*terf stick* good one lol
The Case of the Golden Idol,todays the last day of the steam sale and this game has been on my wishlist for a while but all i have is a laptop with a touch pad with no mouse is this game easily playable without access of a mouse?
The Case of the Golden Idol,wtf is this video and wtf is this game. wtf is happening?
The Case of the Golden Idol,"I think the disconection here lies within the word ""detective-game"". Most people use this word to discribe 'the case of the golden idol' because the game needs you to do similar thinking like a detective would do, while you use the word to specificly discribe a Roleplay-game that lets you play as a detective. Both are different things, and it isn't realy a problem of the discourse if your understanding of a certain word differs from from the rest of the people that talk about the game."
The Case of the Golden Idol,Ehm. Every episode of a game is a murder mystery. Every single chapter player been asked to figure out the details of a murder. And yet you ask “where is the mystery???”. It’s rather confusing when a rythorical question that supposed to have no answer turns into a rythorical with the answer so obvious that it doesn’t worth spelling it.
The Case of the Golden Idol,"Those 5 are your whole list of detective games?

There was this one game that had a web of questions in each chapter.  They weren't all one socket (per question).  Game updates didn't keep up with system updates though and it pretty much died.
It's essentially inventory objects going in the sockets not names and other words.

What about all those ""deduction board"" games?  There's at least one where I don't know why but they made the deduction board most of the interrogation process instead of its own thing.

Deduction board=those things where you mash clues together to make little baby clues or something else to further the case."
The Case of the Golden Idol,"I understand and agree with pretty much all of your points, but I still felt like a detective lol. btw the Unpacking comparison was genius"
The Case of the Golden Idol,"I agree that there isn't a brilliant mystery that's uncovered, other than the Lazarus character. But in each scenario, you solve a murder using the clues in the scene. You listen to what each character is saying, and you analyze the environment and its small details - if this isn't being a detective I don't know what is."
The Case of the Golden Idol,"I have many disaggreaments with the arguments of this video, and I should elaborate on that soon, but is an interesting discussion anyway."
The Case of the Golden Idol,"This video did a great job of putting into words my feelings on this game. I was many hours into the game wondering why the hell I wasn't enjoying it in the same way I did Obra Dinn considering how much I'd seen people talk about how similar the two games felt to play. Eventually I managed to get past that and enjoy it on its own merits, but constantly comparing it to Obra Dinn really hampered a lot of my initial enjoyment of the game and I feel like if I wasn't aware of people making those comparisons, I would have gotten into the game a lot quicker."
The Case of the Golden Idol,Personally I think Id classify it as a mystery game. I wouldn't say there's an overall mystery to solve but its more a series of short mysteries to solve with an overarching story. I see each chapter as its own mystery where you go through all three phases of deduction.
The Case of the Golden Idol,Watching this make me imagine a game about a time-traveler that goes back to [redacted] moments to record their events to help fill in gaps for an [redacted] archive.
The Case of the Golden Idol,"You know, I did a weird experiment of playing the Golden Idol, then playing Obra Dinn (for like a third time) and then Golden Idol again to see how the various experiences differ. I have to say - the Golden Idol is much more enjoyable on your second playthrough since you suddenly get what's going on and you pay attention to the actors to recognize and things ""click"" a lot more. I didn't get that with Obra Dinn since what was going on and the people involved were pretty clear during the first playthrough, probably because you do a lot more back and forth in that game than the linear Golden Idol playthrough. The only big benefit I had playing Obra Dinn again was knowing the tricks to figuring out some identities that were a little cheap the first time around (like telling apart the chinese topmen).

Plus also Golden Idol fails in the sense that you only learn what happened in some of the story by filling in the blanks. Like a good chunk of the epilogue was ""wait, what happened that I missed? Who stole the idol when?"", etc."
The Case of the Golden Idol,"Where Return of the Obra Dinn is like a detective novel, The Case of the Golden Idol is like a bundle of detective short stories. That, to me, still makes it a detective game.
All that means is that we define the label slightly differently, which I think is fine.
Ultimately I still agree with most of your thoughts on the actual nature of the game, which is the part that actually matters, even if we use different words to describe it.


I suppose that does reinforce the point that it's important to be specific when describing games: ""this is/isn't a detective game"" is just as incomplete a statement as ""this game is/isn't like Obra Dinn"". So I suppose when I inevitably tell my friends about this game, I'll be sure to include _in what way_ both of those statements apply to the Golden Idol.

Anyways, regardless of whether or not I agree with this video, I's a great one!"
The Case of the Golden Idol,"This is the sort of youtube channel that makes me not want to make a youtube channel. So often I think of cool ideas for topic that i'd love to present in a long form way and dive into my own brain and others thoughts, especially with game design and narrative. And then I see you, making these amazing videos, and I think why bother. You already do it so well. AND you don't get rewarded with high subs like all the drones with thumbnails of them pulling a dumb face alongside a dumb title."
The Case of the Golden Idol,"I mean couldn't you say the same thing about like half the mystery tv shows out there? Like take Castle, I never cared one wit for any mistery that arced over more then one episode. Does that make it not a mystery show?"
The Case of the Golden Idol,"I hadn't seen any discourse before playing, so I went in to the game completely blind, getting it purely because of the aesthetics. I think a big part of what your issue is comes from what the game is being labeled, and not what the game makes you feel from point to point, which leads to that label in the first place. I felt like a detective, because I picked up clues from around a scene and had these wonderful moments of clarity where it all came together, a moment where I felt much more clever than I usually am because I put two and two together.

The original Sherlock Holmes stories are mostly all quite short, and many were not connected by any overarching canon. Does this mean Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories aren't mysteries? Of course not. The characters were consistent (as they were in Golden Idol), but the thrust of the stories came from Sherlock gathering evidence, then solving the case with a flourish. The flourish, in this case, is on display at the start of each case in Golden Idol, and the solving happens backwards, with the player as the lead investigator, the ""script"" of the story coming from your internal monologue (or external since my wife and I played it together). 

This all being said, I really liked this video - I think you gave the game a fair shake, and even though I disagree with some of what you've said, it's clear that this is something that comes from a place of love, and I hope my comment doesn't impact you in any negative way!"
The Case of the Golden Idol,"So after finishing the game, it felt a bit like a step backwards from Obra Dinn. Rather than having one big mystery to solve, you are solving many smaller mysteries, often with the same questions (""who is this person that you've seen before?""). At times it's also needlessly fiddly or obtuse - names are broken into two parts that you always put together in the same order (I guess the only reason to do that was so you could deduce some parentage names, not really worth it...). Then the characters often start talking in a convoluted language, referencing someone by a title or just one half of their name, or referencing a past event that you just have to exit the level and check back on.

The boomerang murder was especially annoying for this, it was really hard figuring out the first and last name pairs even before you assign them to someone and you can't click that sort button otherwise all your work will be gone. Or in the battle where a lot of people died figuring out who fired the cannon was a bit of a leap.

But then when you pay too much attention, the game also doesn't acknowledge it. Why was the footstool underneath the exit trapdoor? Why were the bishops on the chessboard in the same coloured spots if not to indicate someone hastily put the board up. Why were two people with bloodshot eyes if only one glass was drank (I guess someone took a swig from the bottle?)? Then at the end it turns out one of the mysteries you solved was wrong in the end (AFAIR the inn killer was someone different in the end?), which was just a little baffling.

So yeah, there is definitely a lot games like Golden Idol and Obra Dinn could do better. Golden Idol lacking the central mystery is definitely something that's felt throughout. Both games not having a better system to link names, faces and filling in blanks in reports definitely could be a big problem to solve for the next contendor..."
The Case of the Golden Idol,"The word you were looking for was ""Diegetic""."
The Case of the Golden Idol,"So... The difference between ""detective game"" and ""deduction puzzle game"" is just having an in-universe character?"
The Case of the Golden Idol,Architect of Games sent me.
The Case of the Golden Idol,"Cool channel, looking forward to watching it"
The Case of the Golden Idol,"Got here via Adam Millard's video, was intrigued by the game and decided to give it a whirl. Yeah, it definitely doesn't feel like a detective game, more of an adventure game where you mash things together until they fit. Like I can get most of any puzzle complete, but the last few bits are always a problem.

Like hey, the murder at the inn - you have door locked from the inside, window that was clearly broken outwards, a stool beneath a trapdoor, and another room without a key and a window closed with a latch. The solution is that the murderer came in through the trapdoor... but if that was the case, why would the trapdoor in the victim's room have a stool beneath it, and the other trapdoor wouldn't?

Another thing I find a bit annoying in games like this and Obra Dinn is when you know the face of the person that did something, but you don't know their name, so you can't just fill in the half-identity into a mystery as a placeholder to be filled when you actually figure out who the person is. I wished that was an option a few times in Obra Dinn and at least once so far playing the Golden Idol so far..."
The Case of the Golden Idol,You got a shoutout from the architect of games! Ggwp
The Case of the Golden Idol,"I disagree with your definition of a mystery as outlined in the Glass Onion part of the video.
Glass Onion cannot be said to be a fair play mystery (generally meaning, it abides by Knox's rules, or otherwise does not hide information from the watcher), but that does not make it not a mystery. Mysteries can hide clues, that's just a different kind of mystery.
The original Knives Out blatantly lies to you, yet it can certainly be called a mystery. Sherlock Holmes hides information from the reader all the time, but it is certainly a mystery. Mysteries are not constrained to being necessarily solvable, or having all the information given to you. Hell, Glass Onion is VERY solvable, you say so yourself"
The Case of the Golden Idol,‘Turf stick’ is now what I will call wands in Harry Potter.
The Case of the Golden Idol,"I feel like Case of the Golden Idol, Obra Dinn, Immortality, etc are all united under the umbrella of narrative archaeology games.  They're about gathering data and synthesizing a story about events after the fact.  You can apply this to games like Tacoma, Gone Home, and Her Story as well."
The Case of the Golden Idol,"The way you describe the case of the golden idol, when everyone else just throws it in the detective bin, is reminiscent of the way I describe games ""like"" Factorio."
The Case of the Golden Idol,Good observations. Very good!
The Case of the Golden Idol,"Well I guess I have yet another *awesome* channel to binge watch 😂 Good stuff my man, I was iffy on getting “Golden Idol” for myself but now… I have to know *who* that *guy* is 🤣."
The Case of the Golden Idol,"Hey, I am one of the authors of the game. This is an awesome video. Super glad you made it and really like the ideas that you raised in it.

I would agree that we internally don't necessarily consider Golden Idol as similar to Obra Dinn. We had some different ambitions with it (like telling that linear story in an interactive manner), but it is a useful short-hand which to communicate what the game is.

On the other hand, I quite disagree with the ""detectivness"" aspect. In my mind there are many games with detective themes, where you are a detective and commence investigation, but in players mind no investigation happens. So we tried to solve for generating fulfilling ""aha!"" moments which players have to reach on their own, even if at first overwhelmed by all the information.

Likewise, I would consider Obra Dinn a detective game, but definitely not because it has a main character. It could have been removed and nothing in the game would change.

Anyway, amazing video, loved the pacing and the tone. Subscribed."
The Case of the Golden Idol,"That's a profound, well-meditated statement. This pushes the discussion of videogames beyond categories and classifications, as the negative approach of this video-essay proves. The theoretical discussion should be no longer a different collection of critiques that forces one thing to be other, but the analysis of what a piece of art is in its own merits. Essays like this really moves the discussion into the realms of aesthetics. A very nice and well thought video. 
I would also like to point that maybe the golden idol works like a McGuffin. It may be a pivotal thing into the plot, but AND SPOILERS AHEAD:
I strongly believe that the storyline is focused on the character of Edmund Cloudsley and the conspirations he builds around. I also believe that the game has a little bit lack of focus but maybe (and I don't have a proof that confirms my next statement but here it goes) it's an exploration of how we build narratives. The game has a very fragmentary way of telling its epic and I tried to comprehend it as a different way (similar to novels) on how we tell our own stories. I believe that it could explain the lack of main character. The game is more focused on building an ambiance, a collection of scenaries intertwined between them but not a Main Mystery. I dunno, I just wanted to say that the reflections of this essay are very precise and focused. Nice video."
The Case of the Golden Idol,"Stumbled upon this video after finishing the game and found it captured my own thoughts quite well. The whole channel, really, has been absolute goldmine so far from what I've watched. Looking forward to more!"
The Case of the Golden Idol,"You are phenomenal my friend please keep making these amazing videos, I’m always searching for a reason to play a new game I didn’t know (that’s because I’m not good at understanding if a game is for me or not and I feel more comfortable when I’m sure there’s something in a game besides flashy presentation or popularity or people saying it’s good to adhere to a niche of refined people. You did just that with this game managing to talk clearly about good and bad things about it while also being coincise, this was a truly great video."
The Case of the Golden Idol,Obra Dinn was immersive. Idol was just mechanical. Both greath games but no comparison.
The Case of the Golden Idol,"Amazing game, one only problem with mystery games is that when jig is up, there is no replay value, It could be fun, but for how much ?
I've broke my brain solving those puzzles for 12 hours, i can finish this game in half an hour... animations and music are great, I loved the soundtrack for the Lighthouse and the Inn (lower floor)."
The Case of the Golden Idol,"Who is Lazarus Herst?
Done, boom that's it."
The Case of the Golden Idol,I think it’s not entirely wrong to say The Case of the Golden Idol is a spiritual successor to Obra Dinn or a least follows in Obra Dinn’s footsteps. The thing that both games do is be a story focused game with mechanics directly relating to that story while having the player be removed from whether that be from a meta standpoint in Golden Idol or by having the player character be mostly unrelated to the plot like in Obra Dinn. While there may be some differences between the games personally Golden Idol is the closest thing to a spiritual successor to Obra Dinn so far and both games are some of the best examples of games as a story medium.
The Case of the Golden Idol,"Got around to playing Golden Idol and wow… what a game. I agree with you that it’s not a mystery game, more of a straight deduction puzzle game (if that even counts as a genre) if I had to categorize it as something.

But I think the beauty of the modern indie game boom is that genres are becoming obsolete. What kinda of game is say Inscryption? Is it a card battler? Is it a detective game? Is it an interactive story? I think it is all of them. I think we are truly living in a golden era of game innovation - from Obra Dinn, to Tunic, to Golden Idol, to Inscryption, to Forgotten City - I can’t think of another time when so many exciting and uniquely perplexing games have come out.

Consider me your newest subscriber! I love the content and you absolutely deserve way more support! Keep up the great work :)"
The Case of the Golden Idol,"The Case of the Golden Idol was ace. I had lots of fun solving each mystery set-piece.  The creators did some fabulous world-building and that was a good foundation that makes your disembodied, omnipotent and stuck-in-time detecting unique. I'd just say to people to go play it. Regarding Knives Out, Rian Johnstone was recently on Marc Maron's pod talking about the nature of whodunnits and it's very interesting, definitely recommended.  In fact he quotes someone who says whodunnits are really only fair to the reader/viewer if you're a bonefide genius with experience in the field.. they are, for the sake of narrative tension, being justly unfair.They're rarely ever meant to be truly solvable because they are, by and large, thrillers first.  The Ustinov Poirots are a real joy and to do it very well.  Murder-mysteries are really, basically a ""locked room"" thriller... as in how did the murder happen in the locked room where there was no one else? As a fan of this genre I think some of the Jonathan Creek mysteries are so extremely well devised and written.  You come out of it feeling like you should be able to have solved it because the writing deftly conceals that actually you'd have had to had been Jonathan Creek to have ever solved it. It lets you feel the solution was within your grasp all along."
The Case of the Golden Idol,"I really disagree that Obra Dinn is a detective game. I see it as a puzzle game about paperwork like papers please, but without any of the action or affecting consequences that made papers please actually fun. The moment to moment puzzles are all too small to be considered mysteries (like the mystery of where you put your car keys when they're in your coat pocket where you always leave them), Many of Obra Dinn's puzzles aren't who killed this man, but 'what is this person's name' which is a rubbish mystery. The 'mystery' of the ship in general is plain as day from the first few vignettes, and doesn't matter to anything. Motives don't matter in Obra Dinn at all, they're just set dressing to make it feel like it's actually a detective game, they're not used for any detective work. I've seen Obra Dinn compared favourably to sudoku, and I'd agree with that analysis without the 'favourably', but I think we can agree that sudokus aren't mysteries."
The Case of the Golden Idol,"I'm God's Golden Warrior and its my duty to throw people into the street, Saints Row 2 human shield style."
The Case of the Golden Idol,bro the amount of salt casually thrown at outer wilds. god damn lol
The Case of the Golden Idol,"I still feel that although the game as a whole might not be a detective game, most if not all of the levels were detective levels. I like to think of the dinner party as an example. You go through this scene seeing the end result, that someone has died from what appears to be a poisoning. From there you gather evidence and clues and try to infer motives for why some characters might want the true target dead, and why someone else has died instead. There's a very key ""aha moment"" at some point when everything lines up and you can finally prove you know what happened. The game does fail to immerse you in the world, as nothing is gained from your revelation and no main story can be studied in retrospect. So as a whole the game fails to be a large coherent detective narrative because no weight is given to your conclusions, but intrinsically you can feel like a detective as you piece each individual part of the story together, and then move onto the next.

I'd like to add that some levels feel like they are less in the vein of detective work, specifically the cabin level. For the most part it does not seem like you are trying to uncover who killed who, but who did what with what, and the deaths are just an after thought. I still felt like a detective, but I was investigating a b&e not a murder. Which honestly makes me feel more like a detective, as my main drawback from the game was that a death (accidental or intentional) always had to be a part of every scene. I would have much rather enjoyed picking apart the aftermath of a will reading if the main point of the scene wasn't being drawn towards a man on fire, but due to the nature of the game, that doesn't drive the narrative.

Regardless of where we stand on whether the game holds itself up as a detective game through and through, I think most can agree that it was a generally enjoyable game to play."
The Case of the Golden Idol,"It's still a detective game, like I'm sure I just spend almost 9 hours trying to figure out stuff instead of simply watching story unfold
I can see your point though, it doesn't really push as hard as RotOD did on the detective aspect, they saved a lot of crucial information pieces until later, it was almost impossible to see right on the point where it's going
It's entertaining af still, though they limited the scope of being a detective a lot, the last part still makes me feel smart... though just for a short period of time, but surely a detective experience"
The Case of the Golden Idol,"I'm always excited when you upload, you are a great game critic and are helping me to understand how to critique games in a more interesting and accurate way."
The Case of the Golden Idol,"A harryvideogamesarebad classic! Love discussions of genre and influence like this. Funnily I went through something kinda like this with Tunic, where I was expecting a Zelda-like but then my favorite aspects of zelda just werent there. But then sticking with it and seeing the unique qualities it did have to offer made it one of my favorite games ever in the end"
The Case of the Golden Idol,By what human hand did this video get recommended to me. <1000 subs and views. How does this show up in a feed? I didn't know that was possible.
The Case of the Golden Idol,"wait this channel isn’t super popular ? with this level of quality that is criminal, keep up the good work man"
The Case of the Golden Idol,"This was a very good video, you earn youserlf a new subscriber. keep up the good work."
The Case of the Golden Idol,This just popped up on my homepage for whatever reason and I'm glad it did! This is a great video
The Case of the Golden Idol,The mystery in knives out isn't dumb and it's not calling its own mystery is dumb. The perpetrator is dumb and the folly is expecting an elaborate solution to a crime that was in essence and execution sloppy and badly planned. It's the difference between someone's public image being smart while the actual person is just a rich idiot.
The Case of the Golden Idol,"So glad YouTube recommended this to me, because now I can put words to what was bothering me about this game. It's such a delightful game, so weird and new, but it definitely isn't a mystery. Can't wait for what the creators of Golden Idol make next!"
The Case of the Golden Idol,"Wait, I actually think Unpacking might be a detective game…"
The Case of the Golden Idol,"I hadn't actually seen how Case of the Golden Idol plays before this video, and it sure looks like a game that I'd be into!"
The Case of the Golden Idol,"Your videos are awesome, wish you have more subscribers."
The Case of the Golden Idol,"❤️❤️❤️ from the philippines, will watch later haha"
The Case of the Golden Idol,Hype Hype HYPE!!

It just hit Game Pass, and will take about 30 seconds to download."

SteamWorld Dig 2,"Think I'll get it. It's on sale for $10 and will keep me entertained (plus I can take it on the go) until Smash  Ultimate comes out. Course I have Let's Go Eevee and love to play it, but better in dock mode than handheld mode."
SteamWorld Dig 2,Some will say this is Terraria Mod...
SteamWorld Dig 2,Amazing game. I'm impressed with it.
SteamWorld Dig 2,It arrived today mine! :D
SteamWorld Dig 2,So it is kind of like a way more polished version of Super Motherload from steam.

SteamWorld Dig 2,"I loved the original on 3DS and Heist, so I’ll totally have to try this one out when I have the time."
SteamWorld Dig 2,Such a good game. Honestly this is the kind of thing I want more of on Switch. It's got a fantastic gameplay loop and it really lends itself to mobile play.
SteamWorld Dig 2,Beautiful art with a classic side-scrolling action/puzzle gameplay? Sold!
SteamWorld Dig 2,Bought the game today and I'm loving it.
SteamWorld Dig 2,Not a big fan of Metroidvania games at all nor indies in general but this game blows me away. It's not the best of the best but its so special on its own and its a perfect game on a Switch console. I hope it gets a physical release along with Golf Story! Superb games
SteamWorld Dig 2,"I just finished the first game, really liked it, didn't know there was a second until now."
SteamWorld Dig 2,in the end of game... be very hard ):

SteamWorld Dig 2,Should you play the first one before?
SteamWorld Dig 2,This looks like an android smartphone game but in a good way. Maybe i should try it out.
SteamWorld Dig 2,"Is anyone here fan of steamworld heist

SteamWorld Dig 2,Just beat the game. It was unforgettable. The final boss was epic
SteamWorld Dig 2,I really liked the first one and this one looks even better.
SteamWorld Dig 2,I'm loving this game so much! I also reviewed this on my channel. Image & Form Games is an awesome game company - very down to Earth group of people and had strong line of communication with me throughout the development of this game!
SteamWorld Dig 2,What consoles is this for?
SteamWorld Dig 2,This game is brilliant!
SteamWorld Dig 2,nice review
SteamWorld Dig 2,I'll repeat my last comment. This reviewer really did a good job and seemed fairly good at the game. Only people like him should be allowed to review games for IGN. Not some other people that are at a similar level of skill as that guy who could barely finish the tutorial of Cuphead.
SteamWorld Dig 2,it's *8.8/10* guys.
SteamWorld Dig 2,Why no 3DS :/
SteamWorld Dig 2,I thought the thumbnail for this video was the Crazy Frog!
SteamWorld Dig 2,what is that is accent?
SteamWorld Dig 2,Hi
SteamWorld Dig 2,Still looks like Raz from Psychonauts
SteamWorld Dig 2,"I finished Steam World Dig two times. Probably gonna get this as well, but I don't like the female main character.."
SteamWorld Dig 2,im a big gamer and i wont buy this solely because of the female protagonist.
SteamWorld Dig 2,*reviewed on PC and Switch* recorded on PS4. Haha
SteamWorld Dig 2,No procedural generation? No ng+? Why even Bother. 8 hour game and done. This has so much potential with the RPG elements but the devs chose the easy route to money apparently.
SteamWorld Dig 2,"8.8 million subscribers. 1,680 views."
SteamWorld Dig 2,"I remember buying 1 during the PS4 exclusive drought around launch year...
Really enjoyed it."
SteamWorld Dig 2,"It's the same score........
Anyway great game."
SteamWorld Dig 2,Should I get for Switch or Pc? I'm on eshop right now but can't decide
SteamWorld Dig 2,"Discovers that the game actually DOES have post-story content, but still finds a way to complain about it. Classic IGN."
SteamWorld Dig 2,So finding out that the game DOES have post game content doesnt bump it up to at least 0.2 points to make the score a 9 ? .......ok
SteamWorld Dig 2,Omg i just finished Steamworld Dig because i haven't played it before. I didn't know there was a prequel!! Thanks for re-uploading hehe. Does anybody know how much this game costs for ps4? The game looks awesome btw
SteamWorld Dig 2,This just looks like a modern version of Dig Dug from the classic arcades back in the day.
SteamWorld Dig 2,10th
SteamWorld Dig 2,8.8 thank me later
SteamWorld Dig 2,Why re-upload?
SteamWorld Dig 2,FIRST DISLIKE
SteamWorld Dig 2,Why did they re-upload this video?
SteamWorld Dig 2,🅱ig
SteamWorld Dig 2,Anyone want to donate a $10 eshop card so I can get these games ? Plz
SteamWorld Dig 2,What is the background track called which starts around 0:17?
SteamWorld Dig 2,Man i loved this game
SteamWorld Dig 2,Steam world is my favourite game. I played through it 7 times!
SteamWorld Dig 2,"I Played it 3 Times  already because its Pure Chill out  
and as you said the Endgame can be nasty  but its a Nice Game for Low Cash"
SteamWorld Dig 2,Is this worth the 20 bucks?
SteamWorld Dig 2,18th century prospector? you mean 19th century?
SteamWorld Dig 2,"Not the biggest fan of this game tbh. It feels very stale.  In terms of new mechanics it doesn't really have anything interesting. The The new powerups are really lame. A jetpack which just  feels like an upgrade to the grappling hook, a fire picaxe which doesnt do anything really. All of the powerups feel extremely subdued in terms of creativity. There's no powerups like bash from Ori  which completely reinvented platforming. The  skill system is the biggest mechanical addition and it feels half baked. Most of the skills are quality of life upgrades rather than actual beneficial skills (besides double health of course) the skill system is the complete opposite of hollow knight. In that game skills actually we're game changing but you were limited severely on how many you Could equip. In this game skills are pretty much worthless but you can pretty much equip 75% of them. Given how worthless most skills are your incentive for exploration is pretty much non existent since the only optional items you can aquire are cogs for worthless skills or artefacts that only reward you with a garbage final level. The final level of sd2 is really bad. Rather than giving an actual challenging level they go the lazy route of making it a bs overly long endurance test which you have to keep playing over and over again untill you can pretty much beat it damageless which is really bad design. Hollow knight had a far more rewarding bonus level. It was far more focused in terms of design and was not concerned with wasting your time. Besides all the other crap, the world building in this game is lazy. A bevy of worthless static npc's who only exist to give off small fractions of dialogue. Compare this to hollow knight. Npc's are constantly shuffling positions their dialogue is allways changing. One of my favorite moments In That game was  the mining bug you meet at the start of the game. As the game progresses this friendly npc starts becoming sick and you have to eventually kill it which is heart wrenching. Npc's feel like they had actual effort put into them instead of just putting them in their for the sake of having them. In fact the whole story is lame and cliched tbh. Fen is literally every single companion character you met in any other game and he's has nothing that makes him stand out. The fact they want me to cars about him during end game is pathetic since the put no effort into writing him as an interesting character. Besides that the plot twist at the end of the game was garbage. They spend the whole game building up a final battle between rusty and dorthy but they pull the rug out from under you at the last minute. Instead of the battle that was hyped up for the whole game it's instead some worthless npc you spend a grand total of 5 minutes talking to in the game. The story and world building all feel low effort and lazy. Not enough is defined to be interesting which leaves you with a feeling of emptiness upon completion of the game. There's also barely any replay value given how little sequences breaking opportunities there are. Everything In steamworld dig 2 imo feels like a step backwards behind something like hollow knight or Ori which are far more exciting games and have far more satisfying content."
SteamWorld Dig 2,Put a couple of hours into this but just not feeling it. Shame.
SteamWorld Dig 2,Also skip this review and just buy it because one of the cool things about this game is discovering the power ups that this review spoils
SteamWorld Dig 2,"Steam World Dig 2 is a master piece, I'm surprised not many people mention this game. I got 17 hours on it Unlocking everything and I literally had as much fun as Mario Odyssey. It's incredibly addicting, the only downside is that the game is a bit short and it just leaves me wanting more/waiting for the sequel. I give it a 10/10 Must buy and IMO the best Indie game on the Switch."

SteamWorld Dig 2,hate the reviewer
SteamWorld Dig 2,For $20 this game is sooooooooo worth it
SteamWorld Dig 2,Is there is physical version of this game?
SteamWorld Dig 2,I'm sad it's not randomly generated like the first in the series; as it defeats the idea of replaying to get a different experience each time.
SteamWorld Dig 2,3:39 shitting up those walls
SteamWorld Dig 2,Drop your switch codes below
SteamWorld Dig 2,I was a huge fan of the original.  Can't wait to get this
SteamWorld Dig 2,I hated the ending through. pretty sad in my opinion with what happens to the planet itself. wont spoil it
SteamWorld Dig 2,"theres an upgrade i dont get how to use it, wich is the one you get by getting all 42 relics, someone know?"
SteamWorld Dig 2,Is it available for 3DS too?

SteamWorld Dig 2,"This was a magical review, the guy who wrote this really knows how to fluff up his writing, whenever I listen to one of Derrick's reviews it always sounds like he wrote an essay for school about a game, with not much heart put into what he's actually saying"
SteamWorld Dig 2,"Nice to have another review from you, Tom. It's been to long since your GameSpot days!"
SteamWorld Dig 2,i must say Tom has the perfect old cowboy voice for this review
SteamWorld Dig 2,You definitely sound more enthusiastic in this review than your other reviews. Keep up the good work!
SteamWorld Dig 2,Better.
SteamWorld Dig 2,This is the new Gamexplain that can have different reviewers for different games because the Switch is so 3rd party friendly! This is awesome!
SteamWorld Dig 2,glad that the developers gave us an option to choose between the vita and switch. vita version for me
SteamWorld Dig 2,Here I thought Ash was going to review this...  Guess he still needs to beat the game... and the first one.
SteamWorld Dig 2,this or minecraft? i can't decide aaa

SteamWorld Dig 2,"Great game, I hope we also get a sequel to Steamworld Heist"
SteamWorld Dig 2,Are the worlds randomly generated
SteamWorld Dig 2,Now im a have to buy it...
SteamWorld Dig 2,image informed games has yet to make a bad steam world game.
SteamWorld Dig 2,Is that penguin a reference to Grape-kun?
SteamWorld Dig 2,"this guy sounds so sassy

SteamWorld Dig 2,I love this game but the last boss it too hard.
SteamWorld Dig 2,I feel like this could be Game of the Year... well at least top 5.
SteamWorld Dig 2,I can't bear this voice
SteamWorld Dig 2,"This seems pretty good, I might give it a try.
P.s. Do a review or discussion about Dragonball Xenoberse 2 for Switch!!! I'm hooked on it 😆🖒"
SteamWorld Dig 2,1:00 that peguin might be a reference to the penguin that feel in love of an anime girl in a zoo in japan when Kemono Friends
SteamWorld Dig 2,Already finished 100% but i still watched it lmao
SteamWorld Dig 2,"Dig a tunnel, dig, dig, a tunnel....
Dig a tunnel, dig, dig, a tunnel....
Quick, before the hyena cooomme"
SteamWorld Dig 2,Who tf is this
SteamWorld Dig 2,"If you're watching this before playing the game, I'd recommend coming back after playing (And definitely play it, this game's easily a 10/10). This review spoils a bunch of the power ups you get, which I find to be one of the most fun aspects of metroidvanias."
SteamWorld Dig 2,This is the weirdest review I've seen on gamexplain yet. And. I don't like it
SteamWorld Dig 2,I beat the game before you you posted this
SteamWorld Dig 2,Does this mean that the GameXplain crew isn't playing SWD2? That'd be a travesty.
SteamWorld Dig 2,wow i missed so much i currently have all hookshoot and other stuff
SteamWorld Dig 2,The game was really much fun to play. I hope aswell that we get to a third adventure in the Steamworld.
SteamWorld Dig 2,"Guess you could say that this guy...






Liked the game! ...What? were expecting a pun? Get out of here you dig."
SteamWorld Dig 2,"This, golf story and axiom Verge will be my odyssey-waiting games, can't wait to play them all"
SteamWorld Dig 2,So where are you people who are gonna complain about the reviewers voice or the way he reviewed it? I thought it was good.
SteamWorld Dig 2,I thought I recognized the voice. Good to hear Tom is still doing this kind of work.
SteamWorld Dig 2,Poor Grape-kun.
SteamWorld Dig 2,Shitting up Walls.
SteamWorld Dig 2,The soundtrack for this game sounds like Fallout New Vegas. I love this game and the music is amazing.
SteamWorld Dig 2,"I'm one of the few that absolutely hated Steamworld Dig - I don't know what it was, but that game did not resonate with me in any way whatsoever.  I can't see myself picking up 2, but I'm glad it sounds like it improved on some of the first game's flaws!"
SteamWorld Dig 2,Whating up walls?
SteamWorld Dig 2,"Is this really the same Tom who has been on Gamexplain before, because if it is, he has improved soooo much on his reviews!"
SteamWorld Dig 2,"This, then Golf Story, then Axiom Verge baby!  Good to be a Switch owner."
SteamWorld Dig 2,3:39 “shitting up walls”
SteamWorld Dig 2,3:39 shitting up walls
SteamWorld Dig 2,So many digging puns in this comment section
SteamWorld Dig 2,*Please anyone anyone! Take my switch fc! Pls SW-7187-7048-6311*
SteamWorld Dig 2,"Controversial opinion. This game was better then Samus Returns (which was great).
I can't believe I 100% this game already. 17 hours later..."
SteamWorld Dig 2,"""Nothing in steam world dig 2 is bad"" then explains why he thinks the combat is bad...."
SteamWorld Dig 2,what a weird review lol
SteamWorld Dig 2,Looking for a good Nindie so I have something to play until Fire Emblem/Odyssey in October. Any good ones?
SteamWorld Dig 2,"3:39 , I love shitting up walls, this ones a must buy for me"
SteamWorld Dig 2,Is there a physical copy
SteamWorld Dig 2,"This game is amazing!
I can't recommended enought."
SteamWorld Dig 2,This game is fucking awesome
SteamWorld Dig 2,"I really love this game, and I agree the only real downside is that you have to return to town way too often."
SteamWorld Dig 2,Diggings what they dig. Ya dig?
SteamWorld Dig 2,I'm really digging this review. Nice to finally get the dirt on this game.  This reviewer doesn't seem too picky. Did I get all the puns out of the way?
SteamWorld Dig 2,Is the 1st one worth a buy?
SteamWorld Dig 2,"After I finish Samus Returns, I’m definitely getting this to keep those Metroidvania vibes coming."
SteamWorld Dig 2,Make a video on the recent Sonic Mania update!
SteamWorld Dig 2,RIP XBOX ONE
SteamWorld Dig 2,"DIG A HOLE

DIG A HOLE

DIG A HOLE

hmm BUTTERTOAST!!!!

*mha mha hahamhaha*"
SteamWorld Dig 2,"Am I first








I don’t care 🤷‍♀️"
SteamWorld Dig 2,This game is wonderful
SteamWorld Dig 2,Nice
Stardew Valley,Weakness Disgust me
Stardew Valley,I’ve been wanting to play this game basically since it came out
Stardew Valley,This game deserves a 10.  If a game holds up and keeps a player wanting more with tremendous replay value without any complaints that's a massive accomplishment.  Stardew Valley is quite possibly the best video game to come along in decades and will go down as one of the greatest video games of all time.
Stardew Valley,It blows my mind that the entire game was made by one young man. It is so complex but still very clean.
Stardew Valley,If any game deserves a 10 it’s this one…
Stardew Valley,1/10
Stardew Valley,zzz
Stardew Valley,Did Link retire and move to the country?
Stardew Valley,Boring
Stardew Valley,It has a little something for everyone
Stardew Valley,Top notch review for one of the best life sim games of all time
Stardew Valley,"Just downloaded this game for my ticwris max gaming watch , playing this on m my watch for some reason feels so much cooler though 😂"
Stardew Valley,"0:23 ""Linus Wizard Sebastian"" That explains everything"
Stardew Valley,Her voice is so soothing 🙂
Stardew Valley,This Game is perfection
Stardew Valley,"I wish it doesn't show
Year 1, Year 2, .... It somehow makes
me feel rushed. 😭💔"
Stardew Valley,Why 9.5 rather than 10😡
Stardew Valley,"After 1.5 we need another review, the game has been improved even more!"
Stardew Valley,I'm not buying this game
Stardew Valley,I never understood ign reviews...a game like this could have no issues but they won't give it a 10 rating..I guess if your not call of duty you won't get a 10 score
Stardew Valley,this is my favorite game on the switch right now
Stardew Valley,Her voice soothes me
Stardew Valley,dj khaled
Stardew Valley,U gotta be kidding me... u cant finish this after 100 hours? Al u do it farm and talk to neighbors. How can it take 100 hours?
Stardew Valley,double toasted
Stardew Valley,binaural beats
Stardew Valley,alec steele
Stardew Valley,So Stardew Valley is like one giant safe space. Gotcha.
Stardew Valley,"started this game when it first came out, in 2 weeks I got like 100 hours playtime burned Out and now I do the same thing all over again.. halp!"
Stardew Valley,0:21 What? I can't become Anyone's Worst Enemy??? This game SUX! :P
Stardew Valley,when the party's over billie eilish
Stardew Valley,kid cudi
Stardew Valley,jacksepticeye
Stardew Valley,So basically it's a new Harvest moon game ?
Stardew Valley,Wait they rated a game higher than COD? Hell has frozen over! This is the first genuine and legit review I've heard from IGN since when they first began. Put this woman as the reviewer of ALL games. She knows what she's doing.
Stardew Valley,I still enjoy the older versions of Harvest Moon and Rune Factory.
Stardew Valley,What a fantastic game this is.
Stardew Valley,Why is everybody saying that people are being mad at ign? What did ign do?
Stardew Valley,Have you ever farted before
Stardew Valley,"""even after 100hours I still feel there's much more"" yeah that's because 100 hours is nothing. Let's take ARK for example, if you play the game the way it is meant to be played and bring rates down to official rates 1x, it takes about 300hrs to finish 1 map and there's like 5-6 maps out there to finish."
Stardew Valley,Nice review
Stardew Valley,.
Stardew Valley,"This looks like
Super nintendo,crossed with sega Gen.
Crossed with secret of mana crossed with sim city crossed with minecraft crossed with zelda crossed with....
List goes on"
Stardew Valley,Do the multiplayer saves or is there cabin gone when they are? Also is this game cross play? Can you play Xbox and switch together?
Stardew Valley,"Hey, can I borrow your axe? 




Gonna do some chopping"
Stardew Valley,Warn for spoilers please
Stardew Valley,"Why not a 10/10? 
I'd like to know what took away that 0.5 atleast."
Stardew Valley,"I didn't like it at first.  Seems like pointless busy work, but once that first crop comes up, it sinks its hooks into you.  It also has a lot of surprises along the way, that keeps it fresh."
Stardew Valley,Other than mods IS there any difference with Console version than the PC?
Stardew Valley,"""The changing of seasons is one of the most exciting events""

I wonder if she knows how boring that sounds"
Stardew Valley,Bobby Lee brought me here.
Stardew Valley,I played this until animal crossing came out had 40 plus hours now I’m playing animal crossing 24/7
Stardew Valley,"I like this game, but it gets boring and tedious at some points, as does animal crossing."
Stardew Valley,"This is the most adorable, endearing and relaxing game I've ever played."
Stardew Valley,I want this game so bad but i dont have friends to play with. i feel it will be boring if i played alone :(
Stardew Valley,"Sooo this is a Zelda, Minecraft, Animal Crossing combination??"
Stardew Valley,This is actually JUST a job! Why would anyone want to play this? To be trained to be a bot?
Stardew Valley,"If you like farming games you'll love this, my friend likes farming games and I introduced this to him and after just 1-3 weeks we had 25 hours in game and still have so much more to do."
Stardew Valley,So should I buy this game oooor my time at Portia?
Stardew Valley,Really makes you feel like a farm and it's a little something for everyone
Stardew Valley,I'm not saying this is a bad review but why does IGN only post positive reviews? Even on shitty games?
Stardew Valley,It really makes you feel like Stardew Valley.
Stardew Valley,I never thought id like this game before. But now im glad i got it for the switch. Its so fun to me already got a bunch of hours on it.
Stardew Valley,Pokemon graphics coincidence
Stardew Valley,2020 still playing this game?  🖐🖐
Stardew Valley,"I knew the game wasn't for me but I bought it for the hype. I respect Eric Barone and his effort but I did not find ""planting"" ""seeds"" in a matrix and waiting for the character to sleep every 5 minutes very interesting. Not to mention first thing that happened to me in this game was passing out and receiving a medical bill. Seriously minecraft way more chill."
Stardew Valley,Bobby lee brought me here
Stardew Valley,i wish i could support the developers and buy the actual game and not the cracked one but oh yeah everything on the internet is a scam is my parents mindset
Stardew Valley,worst. game. ever
Stardew Valley,I see more comments sayin to stop hating based on the dead cell review than comments hatin
Stardew Valley,Meme rewiev but StArDeW VaLleY vErY NiCE
Stardew Valley,I’ve played sinc release
Stardew Valley,Great review
Stardew Valley,"Person on previous review: why 8.8? this is an easy 9.5
IGN: _makes it a 9.5_"
Stardew Valley,I scrolled down expecting ppl to be talking about the game so I can decide to buy it or not but instead everyone's having a meltdown about something completely unrelated
Stardew Valley,Its got a little something for everyone
Stardew Valley,Harvest moon back to nature
Stardew Valley,I love her peaceful voice!
Stardew Valley,"I got this game... uh, yesterday and I recommend it to everyone, I played about 4 hours (made some messups in 1 save so made another) and it is so fun"
Stardew Valley,800th comment
Stardew Valley,Damn she just flexed her 100 hours
Stardew Valley,One of the best games I ever played! It was a weird and sad feeling when it got to the point where there was nothing left to do!😅
Stardew Valley,"well ill have you know i have a 2 hour save, so haha"
Stardew Valley,Such a great game
Stardew Valley,So this is minecraft story mode
Stardew Valley,She has an extremely pleasant voice to listen to.
Stardew Valley,Is this like Harvest Moon or more like a survival rpg in 2D?
Stardew Valley,Its fcking harvest moon
Stardew Valley,"Can't get into this game. Tried so many times, starts slow. Stays slow, not for me sadly, looks like it could've been fun."
Stardew Valley,She has a really nice voice💜
Stardew Valley,"this review made me fall asleep
thx a lot ......"
Stardew Valley,I just love the way that the game doesn't force you to take any specific path. Like you can go as fast or as slow as you want and the game isn't going to try to change that.
Stardew Valley,Great review :) i think this is genuinely the nicest game ever made
Stardew Valley,Do u guys want to do a rewiew? so shutup and stop being horrible to someone u dont even know.
Stardew Valley,"""Coming back to Stardew Valley is like coming back home"" .. if you came back home if you were 3 years old"
Stardew Valley,Too bad they still haven't updated the console versions (except for the Switch)
Stardew Valley,How many save slots/farms can you create on stardew valley PC?
Stardew Valley,It's the perfect game why isn't it 10/10?
Stardew Valley,"it's out on android now 
go buy it now"
Stardew Valley,shes trying to flex on us with an 100 hour save
Stardew Valley,"Did you enjoy this video? Support the channel by buying me a coffee :)
https://www.buymeacoffee.com/robokast"
Stardew Valley,2:40 im a romanian and i understand what that woman said lmao
Stardew Valley,Did your friend just blow up your only ancient plant??? Really hope you started the day over
Stardew Valley,clints cool
Stardew Valley,"I started to play it in my cellphone cuz a friend told me to play it, and I don't have a computer or an actual videogame, so, I thought I wouldn't like playing so much this game, because touch system is a shit, but here I am"
Stardew Valley,"I declare the Cult of Penny. F..k Abigail, f..k Leah, f..k everyone else.. LONG LIVE PENNY!"
Stardew Valley,Great review
Stardew Valley,You didn't really explain why it's good you just explained what you do. This video sucks
Stardew Valley,Nah this game sucks senpai
Stardew Valley,"HARVEY is the best marriage candidate.  Elliott and Leah come in second.  These three live on their own.  Like grownups.  Emily and Hayley (sisters) I suppose are more like room-mates, no parents seem to be around.  Shane, Sebastian, Alex, Sam, Maru, Abigail, Penny all live at home.  With their parents.  Not ready to be married."
Stardew Valley,What an ugly little game.
Stardew Valley,no hate but isn't this just a remake of HARVEST MOON?
Stardew Valley,Undertal was way more fun
Stardew Valley,"I really can't get into Stardew Valley. I just don't have the patience.

For my farming fix i have a real garden."
Stardew Valley,"Bachelorretes:

Haley : the slow and painful exponential route.
Penny : the ""I'm going to fix her"" route.
Abigail : The weird but fun e-girl route.
Emily : The hippie route.
Maru : The underrated route.
Leah : The ""finding your place in life"" route

Bachelors :

Harvey : ""I AM A SURGEON"" route.
Sebastian: The ""please let me in your room so I can give you tear drops you basement dweller"" route.
Shane : The ""I am going to fix him"" route.
Alex : The male Haley.
Elliot : The vampire route
Sam : The ADHD route. 


? :
Krobus : The introvert that deserves a much needed hug."
Stardew Valley,7 days to a better game
Stardew Valley,"i cracked stardew valley so just imagine this is a negative review on steam: I actually dont like this game like i have it right now open and ive been so bored not knowing what boring thing to do next like harvesting crops or giving npcs gifts ive litellary searched why people like this game and spend 14 euros on it its all just a big slow walk to every single tile in the whole map , its a very grindy game like it takes so much progrres to achieve a very small thing, have u ever played a mobile farming game like hayday or something its kinda the same but without ads and payments u need to wait a long time for your crops to grow than u plant them again and make a profit of like 1000 g then u have to repeat this procces 10 times just the get a single coop but wait cuz u need to buy chickens too to make profit of it right? so you grind 2 more days then u get the money back in after a season from selling the eggs and this is just a super small part of the game ."
Stardew Valley,Best part of the game is that sea urchins can wear hats.
Stardew Valley,Stardew Valley forever!
Stardew Valley,I take issue with a lot of the points in this video
Stardew Valley,"I loved my time at portia and thought i had to play stardew valley too and today I started playing it for a couple hours but I am so disapointed.. feels like half the playtime is walking so unbelievable slowly through the world, and you are forced to walk home every evening or you'll get fined with money loss penalty.. 😫 
I dont know if I can contiue the game anymore.

But everybody hypes this game so much, what am I missing??"
Stardew Valley,"I have 3 perfection files and about 10 more incl. some co-op farms I play with friends. I've married pretty much every bachelor and bachelorette. Krobus is still one of the best options because he gifts lucky lunches and fried eel. Haley, Penny, Leah are the best bachelorettes and Elliot, Alex and Harvey are the best bachelors. I don't make the rules."
Stardew Valley,Elliott is my choice every time I just like the starving writer aesthetic
Stardew Valley,mi se pare misto ca a fost un meme in romana dar nu e niciun roman in comentari
Stardew Valley,"I like the video with the woman and the axe, they are speaking Romanian:)))"
Stardew Valley,"I always marry Shane. I can't help it, I just want to fix him and have blue chickens."
Stardew Valley,"I understand the abagail love, but emily has my heart, and it may or may not because she reminds me of someone i know in real life…dont judge me"
Stardew Valley,Can you place this on the Apple MacBook Pro?
Stardew Valley,I have no idea about this game but I see it is high on the rankings. I assume there is no combat phase? It’s not for me but it’s interesting there is such a large demographic segment for this type of game. In a way I think it has virtualized the innate human need to get away from the sterile loneliness of the ironically digitized artificial urban lifestyle of today and into a closer and more organic community of real relationships and even real food.
Stardew Valley,"Favourite game of all time. It got me back into gaming in the midst of crippling opioid and benzodiazepine addiction which I’m still dealing with, but I’m a lot cheerier knowing I have “friends” and a farm to keep my mind active. Stardew Valley is more than a game to me and Pelican Town is kinda like a real place of solace for me. I’ve min/maxed the game to no end and have over 1000 hours on record.

Now I’m starting from scratch with the Switch version because my PS4 won’t let me into my downloaded games due to forgetting my password and having 2 factor authentication on, which I don’t know how to use or undo."
Stardew Valley,I’m sold after seeing there is an anime waifu mod.
Stardew Valley,Fun fact: Stardew Valley violated the Geneva convention
Stardew Valley,Stardew is my favourite game of all time. Its such a good comfort game whenever i am sad i play it and it is such a nice way to escape from reality
Stardew Valley,Big soy energy 😅
Stardew Valley,haven't
Stardew Valley,I always choose between Elliot (unproblematic king who dedicated books to me) and Shane (for his awesome character arc and development)
Stardew Valley,i miss harvest moon/bokujou monogatari...
Stardew Valley,I can’t get into it for some reason 🤔🤔🤔
Stardew Valley,Sebastian is my favorite  personally
Stardew Valley,"""Rural Vietnam"" ok 😐"
Stardew Valley,"i bought the game in early 2016, and i love it so much"
Stardew Valley,This is my favorite game ever and I do anything To save it
Stardew Valley,I’m team Sam. very unproblematic and very cute
Stardew Valley,Just bought it for $19. A very good price for a game with so much clout. I loved Harvest Moon so I should love this too.
Stardew Valley,don’t do garlic powder like that
Stardew Valley,"I never played this one but want to try it someday. But this just proves my point that a simpler with low graphics but with nice gameplay is better than a random game with nice graphics. 
All the games I remember fondly were simpler games wich I would play to exhaustion, not the latest game with nice graphics."
Stardew Valley,And remember it you install Stardew valley expanded you'll have another game to play.
Stardew Valley,0:34 you say that but farming is fun for the reasons that real life farming is fun
Stardew Valley,"Nah, I tried it, it' not for me. Nothing really outstanding about this, coming from Terraria, Valheim, 7 days to die or Apex."
Stardew Valley,Lol its not all perspective
Stardew Valley,Ya I’m still not sure why Abigale eats rocks
Stardew Valley,this is one game I wish I could play the first time again
Stardew Valley,MARU GANG MARU GANG
Stardew Valley,Stardew Valley is the bubble wrap of games. Every second there's a satisfying sound
Stardew Valley,"I like stardew vally but i suppose my problem with it is it needs a bike
Or something
Idk or running shoes 
But other than that i really like it very fun n all im gonna max out my tools in upgrades first"
Stardew Valley,"For my, it's the vibe. The world the game depicts. Everything is clean, pure, colorful, natural. People enjoy life as simple as it is. This game gives me some feeling I can't find the word."
Stardew Valley,I’m gonna play this with my boyfriend 🎉🥹
Stardew Valley,"I first wanted to go for Shane, bc I feel him and his struggle. But then Emily has this amazing weirdo charm that I adore and love, and then Harvey is also so attractive, nice and kind, but then Sam is such a sweetie every single time you talk to him... <3 Like how does one choose??? hahaha"
Stardew Valley,"I got  1500 hours solo, not played with mods yet, love the new Qi challenges ....im 73 years old"
Stardew Valley,another game i love is My Time at Portia. some people call it 3D stardew. Love Portia
Stardew Valley,"bruhhhh when i was told 1 person made stardew valley i as like gtfoh bruhhhh... i was actually shocked, still cant believe it. eric barone = the GOAT"
Stardew Valley,"But sincerely, PC has multiplayer mode 2 years ago, n when the mobile get 1 att after all this time, it doesn't bring everything PC have.  Disappointing"
Stardew Valley,God remember cube world alpha ? What a stinker lol but we loved it.
Stardew Valley,1:48 7 days to die is infinitely better than this POS.
Stardew Valley,"Honestly, I love SDV. But, at times, it can get pretty boring and tedious so that is why I use mods so I can get stuff like access to my chests everywhere! honestly love this game tho"
Stardew Valley,"For me I like the Game so much because of the freedom of having no time limit(Except for the Seasons) and being able to do many different things(Farming, Fishing, Fighting, etc.). Also the NPC's have a very good Story and add a lot of Charm to the Game"
Stardew Valley,Haley. Is. The. Best
Stardew Valley,"Elliott is by far the best marriage candidate, you guys are just cowards"
Stardew Valley,"I only played Stardew Valley a bit. Just 970 hours. Not that long.
I've actually only married once in the game, and it was Emily. But I'm going after Abigail now. She reminds me of a Vtuber I watch."
Stardew Valley,Stardew valley is my favorite game and penny best wife I will take no comments
Stardew Valley,All the answers to how we should live our lives is in this game.
Stardew Valley,"Do you know how you tell something is impressive, by not saying it is impressive....

You are using manipulation and one has to wonder why you need to MANIPULATE is into thinking something is impressive, when if it was impressive you could show us, without having to use the word once."
Stardew Valley,SV is definitely a great relaxing game! But Rune Factory is much more awesome.
Stardew Valley,"Harvey is the best boy. So sweet and loving. 
Abigail is the best girl because purple hair. 😁"
Stardew Valley,"The shade and your sense of humor are sending me 😂😂 great video, man!"
Stardew Valley,I love my emo boyfriend Sebastian
Stardew Valley,I love Stardew valley
Stardew Valley,My favorite of all time ♥️ i still have my farm on my phone and I kinda want to play again
Stardew Valley,What's the game at 0:13 called? Looks cute
Stardew Valley,I love it cuz I played friends of mineral town as a kid
Stardew Valley,"i dont like the artstyle of stardew valley , i would rather play farming simulator"
Stardew Valley,"I wish more creators would recognise that his gf supported him (financially and otherwise) all through the development,  she deserves more credit towards Stardews creation than she gets."
Stardew Valley,I LOVE BORAT
Stardew Valley,w video
Stardew Valley,00:12 game name please
Stardew Valley,"The first back pain that i ever experienced in my entire life is when i discovered this game. I played it way too much for my own good, and i come to the conclusion that I’m getting older 😂"
Stardew Valley,WHAT IS WRONG WITH SAM. HE IS A SWEETHEART. I AM GOING TO EAT YOU BARK BARK BARK BARK
Stardew Valley,The Graphics looks awful though.
Stardew Valley,Probably tmi but stardew valley a game I wanted to play before I deleted myself I played it and put so much time in it that first setting that I just kinda forgot what I was so depressed about I was able to get away and have a clearer mind when I ultimately had to confront my issues.
Stardew Valley,"I'll be honest, i got this game for free by downloading the cracked version of it (I know Cracking is bad). Loved it so much to the point i bought it on steam officially."
Stardew Valley,"tried it, it sucked. :/"
Stardew Valley,"Wallow in the misery of marriage?

Sounds like you are doing it wrong"
Stardew Valley,"2:36 She was talking in Romanian, and these were not some good words lmao."
Stardew Valley,my wife haley is the love of my life
Stardew Valley,i went for maru...
Stardew Valley,"Stardew valley is so wholesome, you can’t even put it into words"
Stardew Valley,"Harvest moon is just that girl like she is so good..... i remember playing it so much, i still have the nintendo but we dont have a charger for it 😭😭 stardew valley reminds me so much of it and is such a unique and good game as well im still obsessed with it umtil now"
Stardew Valley,"Omg I love this game so much, I haven't loved a game this much for a while"
Stardew Valley,One of the best games in the market for sure :)
Stardew Valley,"This game has been getting me through college. When I’m super stressed, I just turn on my game and escape into my super aesthetic little farm and live the good life. It’s almost like it reminds me why I work hard: so I can have my own perfect little “farm” in the real world. I’m not a gamer, but this game is such a blessing to my sanity, I’ve even been known to sit in class and play with one hand and take notes in the other, I’m now on a profs dislike list. But that’s not the point, it’s such an incredible and beautiful game that I can’t help but be obsessed"
Spiritfarer,Just bought this game on sale. What a great game.
Spiritfarer,enchanting game
Spiritfarer,I cried while played
Spiritfarer,Beautiful and deep analysis of this game. Very well done!
Spiritfarer,"Play the demo and you'll see how the game wants to tell you how you should feel about events. Wokified crap, avoid."
Spiritfarer,I like the art
Spiritfarer,One thing I don't like about this game is the ladder animations.
Spiritfarer,Hi guys. Looks like I'm 1 year late. Is this game any fun?
Spiritfarer,"Hey, is that you, Orc?"
Spiritfarer,This game exceeded my expectations.
Spiritfarer,"Thanks for a really great, informative review which helped me decide (whether) to buy Spiritfarer!"
Spiritfarer,Chulip is better
Spiritfarer,Metroidvania w/o kills? Sounds fuN!
Spiritfarer,It’s impressive how I’ve spent over 25 hours on this game and I haven’t even finished it. Also all of this time has been used well and never gets tedious it’s hard to put down. And as I’ve said the time is filled with good well written dialogue. Never gets annoying
Spiritfarer,Just picked this game up on GOG. Sounds fucking incredible and I am really glad I found your channel because this review was great.
Spiritfarer,Really well written and well delivered review! I think this might be perfect for my good friend's birthday
Spiritfarer,"What a huge Disappointment this turned out to quickly be. If you think you are in for a deep and immersive game. Well after only minutes you realize that what you see is not going anywhere fast.
An extremely slow paced Indie game that might seem to offer a new feeling to a new game. Yet in reality you are facing imminent boredom. Your ship is an awkward cut out that belongs in a pop up book.
Your only excitement which repeats annoyingly, is trying to catch something flying by you.
You soon hope that you will find out that the game will open up if you can just reach shore. Wrongful thinking. You find out that the pointless point and click on land, was designed for 7 year olds from the start. Achievements are zero as you find one belittling item and have to rush back to that .,*&= ship again. 
No I do not recommend this game to any age groups. It’s shallow and frustrating how unadventurous a game can become. I’m actually writing this more out of frustration, seeing it on Editors choice, where it certainly sh not be."
Spiritfarer,"This review is spot on, well done! Spiritfarer is an amazing game. It just might be one of the best games I have ever played. And I've played many, many games, from triple A to obscure indie. In terms of feeling involved and absorbed, Spiritfarer is absolute gold. And it sprinkles such beautiful surprises throughout the game. The music, characters, artwork and animation is all so perfectly in check with each other. A truly amazing accomplishment by the relatively small Canadian developer Thunder Lotus."
Spiritfarer,"I am thankfull that You did this review, because I would have passed it by without second thought."
Spiritfarer,"I like the game, this game is addicted...."
Spiritfarer,"ESRB label includes ""Language Warning"". Can anyone here tell me if the Lord's name is taken in vain by any of the characters in Spiritfarer?"
Spiritfarer,i wish there was a way you can look at the map at night even when you can’t navigate
Spiritfarer,I don’t have an ill temper :(
Spiritfarer,what a great review 👍
Spiritfarer,"Just picked up the physical from bestbuy. Comes with a post card set (I left it sealed) a stamp set, and a download code. (Art book/soundtrack) 
Been playing it 4 hours now and I can say its in my top 25 of 300 physical i own. 
Gris beats it in atmosphere. . . but i put them near eachother on the shelf."
Spiritfarer,I’ll buy it on Steam :3
Spiritfarer,I cried so hard when I helped Gwen and Summer cross over! 😂 10/10 would recommend!
Spiritfarer,"I bought this game based almost entirely on this glowing review, and I gotta say... man, you did not nail it at all. At this point, I've put many, MANY hours into Spiritfarer, but despite that it has its charms, so much of the gameplay loop is just frustrating that I'm having trouble wanting to continue. 

The day/night cycle is irritatingly short, making you cram in as much as possible before losing the ability to travel for the night. You're constantly being harassed for multiple types of foods by your passengers to the point that it can take up a majority of those days just to make sure everyone is content before traveling somewhere else. Travelling itself takes up way to much time (even after unlocking fast travel) which also means you'll have to give more food in between. The map doesn't always clearly mark what quest is tied to what area, meaning you could be going to a highlighted area only to find it wasn't the quest route you wanted to pursue. The list of little annoyances goes on and on."
Spiritfarer,This is a great review. Thanks. Definitely going to pick this up on Switch! Side note: you sound almost identical to a YouTuber called City Beautiful who talks about town planning. It’s uncanny!!
Spiritfarer,Wowowowowowowowow
Spiritfarer,3:45 I laughed to hard when I first saw the animation of Stella and Daffodil sawing a tree :D
Spiritfarer,"This game is too slow with lots of travelling, unskippable animations (sleeping + waking up) and way too much grinding.

I think Steam reviews will settle down later, but now it's too high.


The game is good tho"
Spiritfarer,Makes me think of another really great game tackling the subject of death and being in limbo before the final destination: Grim fandango!
Spiritfarer,"I just got it yesterday on Steam (it's on sale) and spent the entire evening with it. Personally, I find the relaxing first hours of the game quite pleasant. As a casual player, I like that I don't have to rush from one task to another (at least not yet), and I could even let Stella go to sleep the first couple nights (it's always an option if you run out of things to do in the evening). It helped me slowly get eased into the game, stock some food, explore the map and learn the mechanics. Can't wait to get back to it tonight :)"
Spiritfarer,this game is just such a wholesome break from all the toxicity in some multiplayer games
Spiritfarer,I just finished this game about 10 minutes ago. I adored it. Totally didn't cry. I'm deadass
Spiritfarer,Anyone have recommendations for similar games? I played this and loved it so much! Hoping to find something else to fill the void.
Spiritfarer,"It seems like a very emotionally heavy concept.
So i came to reviews like this to see if it would be worth it. 

It seems like it is. <3"
Spiritfarer,Is anyone else like about to cry just from this?
Spiritfarer,"Satisfying
Spirit:""mUrDeReR"""
Spiritfarer,"""and I have to emphasize that this isn't a depressing game"" well, depends on your personality I guess, because I got depressed at some points 😅"
Spiritfarer,"I got sad when one of my fav characters went to the after life, and it was 5 hours in TwT"
Spiritfarer,This game is available just for $5 dollars in russia region it's a great deal considering the quality of game
Spiritfarer,This is a chicken noodle soup for the heart kind of game. It's heavy but in a good way.
Spiritfarer,Buying it now bc of this review. Looked decent. Knowing about it; seems amazing. Thank you for the review!
Spiritfarer,Is the reviewer from Long Island or Brooklyn area?
Spiritfarer,At 1:30 you already had me
Spiritfarer,"I'm way too sensitive, if I play this I'll cry everytime somebody passes 😭😭"
Spiritfarer,"I love little games with a cult following and a cute art style, literally my favourite. And now I found one!"
Spiritfarer,"I love Gwen, she’s a sweetie 💕"
Spiritfarer,"I wish this game got more attention, it’s so good"
Spiritfarer,"Great review, Picking it up now. Sometimes we need something emotional and spiritual to play.. Kinda like Hollow Knight.. That game was magical. And looks like Spiritfarer will fill that soft spot I need from time to time. Thank you sir."
Spiritfarer,"Introduced to this game by the soundtrack which was brought from my GF, those gorgeous music made buying this game a no brainer"
Spiritfarer,This game is underrated I reccomend buying it
Spiritfarer,Alright you sold me. Downloading it immediately!!
Spiritfarer,Spiritfarer+ xcloud = <3
Spiritfarer,Thunder lotus is proving to be one of the best indie studio out there
Spiritfarer,prepare to cry
Spiritfarer,I’ve been playing this game for hours. It’s an amazing game
Spiritfarer,Never seen a black ginger without chemicals involved.
Spiritfarer,Loved it... The Last of Us 2 wanted to have this much depth.
Spiritfarer,Who's here because of Kid Fury?
Spiritfarer,great review :)
Spiritfarer,Just purchased it. Can’t wait to start it
Spiritfarer,Spirited away meets terraria
Spiritfarer,"I don't usually play games like this, but I was honestly interested in this one when I first saw the trailer. I think it's worth giving a shot."
Spiritfarer,This game is AMAZING and the first one I've been hooked on in awhile. I'm in the PNW and can't go outside because of the fires so finding a good game to play inside has been a goal of mine. So glad to have found this one!!
Spiritfarer,Why indie is the future of gaming not AAA
Spiritfarer,Looks like a wonderful game to teach kids about life n death.
Spiritfarer,"Would GameXplain consider a spoiler cast about this game? I’m almost done with the main story and I have THOUGHTS (mostly good thoughts, with some sad thoughts mixed in)"
Spiritfarer,the game looks soooo good... waiting for a physical limited run release
Spiritfarer,too many text boxes with only 1 sentence let alone just 1 word which means you have to hit x 100 times per conversation and if you hit b to skip itll just leave and make you start the whole ocnversation over. that is pissing me off
Spiritfarer,was on the fence but you convinced me to get the game
Spiritfarer,"3:49 You say there is no combat but that log calling you a murderer makes me think that you killed an innocent tree and it’s children

You monster"
Spiritfarer,ABLEIST REEEEEEEEEEEE
Spiritfarer,"I see what you did at the end there with that circle, very clever! This game is amazing. I literally can't put it down at this point."
Spiritfarer,I got this game when it came out because the trailer Interested me. Was not even close to disappointed. Such an addicting game I literally can't stop playing it right now.
Spiritfarer,This game is so calming
Spiritfarer,HUGS and FEELS!!! The Game.
Spiritfarer,This game was very depressing for me and lead to existential crises after finishing it.
Spiritfarer,Got it today and I am LOVING it.
Spiritfarer,"First video of yours I've watched. Great stuff!! Love the way you break things down, it's all really helpful"
Spiritfarer,You convinced me my dude. Where's my wallet...
Spiritfarer,This look like smt up my alley. Thz!
Spiritfarer,"Not just PC and Switch, also PS4."
Spiritfarer,:C yis
Spiritfarer,"I downloaded the game today. I’m completely addicted and this is getting close to being one of my favorites games ever (depending on how the second half of the game goes), but I CANNOT STAND the fast travel theme. I actively avoid fast traveling because of this, I feel like the developers did this on purpose but come on! The combination of my “crew” playing instruments, general sound effects and the chaotic, annoying song, drives me insane. 
P.s. I’m in love with Gwen 🥺"
Spiritfarer,"I see the games 2 player, Can you play couch co op?"
Spiritfarer,I don't play this genre either but I will absolutely forget about hours to it in a way I haven't felt since Sims 2
Spiritfarer,"Goodbyes, both permanent and temporary, are the one of things I dread most in life. This game looks beautiful, but I'm not sure if it would be cathartic or cause extreme anxiety."
Spiritfarer,"Fantastic review, imo you've done this game the justice it's deserved, not sure why didn't i cross your channel before but am glad i did today!"
Spiritfarer,"Ngl, Alice's story broke my heart into little pieces."
Spiritfarer,Sounds very promising. Saw it on Gamepass but didn't think more about it. Now I have to try it. :)
Spiritfarer,Can someone please me wear to get pulsar ingot or zinc ingot!?
Spiritfarer,I wonder what the writer of this game must have been going through to decide to make a game like this. Truly wonderful
Spiritfarer,This game made me cry so many times. It's a beautiful little game
Spiritfarer,"Damn, I already got emotional when my long time villager in Animal Crossing leaves, I guess this game gonna multiply that tenfold"
Spiritfarer,"I was hooked by the animated sprites. It looks gorgeous and all, but personally, I feel like I'm terrible at games that ask for managing stuff. That's why for example I never got much into strategy titles or certain sim games, tower defense and whatnot. Now I wonder, for one who might like casual sim and advanture games, is this game something for me? I am always worrying that I could play it and the characters in-game are all just disappointed that I couldn't solve all their needs in time. ^_^'"
Spiritfarer,sometimes the art style looks amazing .. sometimes it looks like a newgrounds flashgame
Spiritfarer,"Why (Switch, PC) only ? it's also available on Xbox and it's part of the Xbox Gamepass"
Spiritfarer,"man this game, whenever the main theme song reaches that climax... waters my eyes so hard. I cry waterfalls and get this strong feeling in my chest. The song reminds me of those ""good bye"" moments ... and the hugs man... the hugs are so moving. Damn it. You play the game, and that song gets related to those moments, all back and forth, it creates such a strong connection with me that I either listen just to the song or watch just the scenes and I get to cry again, NO MATTER WHAT."
Spiritfarer,"I have only played the demo and damm I loved it, definetly gonna buy this game"
Spiritfarer,"I'm a bit sad that I cannot connect to the characters and the stories as other people do. At a point, I started feeling the dialogs to be really boring and skipping through most of them fast."
Spiritfarer,Very relaxing game. I love it
Spiritfarer,i love this
Spiritfarer,"This game was so peaceful, I loved it! I was always so sad when everyone left. Especially the frog and the hedgehog."
Spiritfarer,It's much less a game and more of a movie. Zero challenge.
Spiritfarer,"I feel like the first third to half of the game was super strong. Gwen, Atul and ESPECIALLY Alice were my favorites. The later spirits....not so much. Elena felt like a worse Stella and Beverly a worse Alice. I also felt the Stella ""plot twist"" was a bit meh, and some of the platforming was really hard, especially considering this is not primarily a platformer. It took me about 50 hours to complete, but a lot of that time was ""well I'm not really enjoying this but I wanna see it through"". Not a bad game by any means, but I'm glad I got it on sale for like 7 bucks."
Spiritfarer,I definitely agree that the gameplay has a few issues I would definitely agree that the guitar should have more use cases and themes and also the animations for doing tasks are way too long. Though these are very small complaints compared to what the game has too offer and I would 100% reccommend this game.
Spiritfarer,"im not one for kids, being a lesbian. but my mushroom son, my sweet sweet mushroom son? i miss him."
Spiritfarer,"played the demo. Annoying, overly wokified crap. Big pass for me."
Spiritfarer,"It was alright, did 40hrs for 100% completion.
The game clearly has some cut content (Like meditation being used for day skipping) which could've been used and at times they omit details like Buck not needing to be sent to the door. Yeah there's hints as of to why, but his quests where you have to wait several days for each step and you've done everything else...it becomes an incredibly boring waiting game.

Overall the game was alright, the message wasn't as deep as people seem to make it out to be and honestly some of the characters feel very forced in certain aspects (Even if they're based on people the devs have known)."
Spiritfarer,"I'm tempted to get this game on switch, it will probably make me teary. I like building, crafting and gathering games."
Spiritfarer,"I like that you mentioned that ""some sounds are a bit too piercing"", as this was, unfortunately, the reason I stopped playing this game. I had to completely mute the game every time I would water and harvest my crops."
Spiritfarer,Very nice
Spiritfarer,"There are games I hardly recall. There are games which were fun to play. but there are VERY few games that felt like a journey and left an impact. 

Journey, Spiritfarer, and Homeworld are such games. Those engaged me in their stories and figures like no other. I just want to sit down and listen more stories...
and from start to finish, i felt like having 'gone' somewhere, not just finished another stage. There was a reason for every step you took and looking back you felt real clousure."
Spiritfarer,Thanks for making this review I am debating a couple games still not sure but this definitely helped
Spiritfarer,I really like it
Spiritfarer,This game and outer wilds hold a special place in my heart!
Spiritfarer,I cried so much in this game cause i loved all of my villagers
Spiritfarer,Screw that pulsar and sawmill mechanic 🤣🤣🤣😔
Spiritfarer,I just bought it for like $10. I played the demo and it seems interesting. Just waiting for the game to load
Spiritfarer,This one dropped on eShop at $5 so I am checking out for reviews ❤❤❤ thank you so much made me more convinced
Spiritfarer,Atul broke my heart 😢
Spiritfarer,This is the first time I’ve genuinely been sad that I can’t experience a game for the first time again. Most fantastic game I’ve ever played.
Spiritfarer,I 100% this game and got the platinum. One of the greatest and most beautiful games I’ve ever played.
Spiritfarer,"Played it, and loved it. It's definitely not a game for everyone, but if you're in for the story and enjoy taking your time as you progress through a game, this might just tickle your fancy. I can't recommend it enough if you're in to slow-boil kind of games."
Spiritfarer,"Just starting this game, I already love the graphics,and the spirits I have on my boat now."
Spiritfarer,I am finally playing this in good faith to finish it and it is fun but I do need to mix in some other games.  The game is addictive but also too long in my opinion.  I do love the new additions you get and the boat really does transition into an amazing collection of resources and unique buildings.
Spiritfarer,"If anyone’s here in 2022, this is my favorite game of all time. I’ve played it twice (side note-you will cry). I believe it’s $29.99 on the eShop, which it’s SO worth the price, but if that’s too high, sometimes it goes on sale for 50% off! I’ve bought this game twice because of how much I adore it. 

Since this YouTuber’s review, multiple updates have come out that extend the game and improve QOL (like the Lily Update, which allows you to eventually travel at night)."
Spiritfarer,"spiritfarer is very satisfying for me to play, not only from a story/character standpoint, but from a gameplay standpoint. each of the crafting minigames were simple yet unique enough for them to stand out, although some were easier than others. the character minigames were also fun for me, despite all being the same, but they were fun due to unique theming and how they all fit the characters and their personalities. i also really enjoyed the many opportunities to do side quests and such, as i'm a completionist when it comes to most games. collecting everything to gain rewards from susan felt satisfying once i was finished with it. 

as for the story and characters, i felt as if i could connect to most, if not all, of them in one way or another. having to let all of them go was heartbreaking and i cried until my face hurt, especially for alice and stanley. and although yes, i would agree that this game is certainly not for everyone, considering everyone has different tastes and plays differently, i would have to say that this game is one that everyone should at least look into. its theme of learning to let go after a loved one passes, i feel, is one that is important, long-lasting, and impactful. it handles such theming very gracefully and with respect, which i appreciate a lot. 

anyway, my long ramble is over. if you haven't checked the game out, i suggest that you do, whether it's finding a playthrough or purchasing and playing the game yourself. i hope you all have a good day/night."
Spiritfarer,"He said people can cry while playing. Lol I've been crying just from watching this. Yes, I'm that emotional"
Spiritfarer,worth it? are you kidding me?
Spiritfarer,"3:54
She’ll sometimes hook on automatically because pushing the move stick up will also make her hook on. So you were probably just pushing up on the stick. Its much better than the d-pad tbh."
Spiritfarer,This is definitely going on my to play list. Anything that deals with death and acceptance will always strike a powerful cord.
Spiritfarer,"I recently finished the game and loved it. But, watching this video made me realize something - the camera is NOT supposed to be that zoomed out on the boat, that you have trouble making out everything. I was wondering when you'd mention that about the things you didn't like about the game, but nope- probably just a bug."
Spiritfarer,The no travel at night is actually fixed with Lily
Spiritfarer,upvoted for limerick
Spiritfarer,This is on sale on the switch store everyone.
Spiritfarer,Great video!
Spiritfarer,"I don't have Stanley yet but my mum had him and he's definitely my favourite, he acts so innocent and he's so cute.
Personally my fav aesthetic is cottagecore and pixiecore and he looks like those ☺️

I also think it's cool that the game is free on xbox gamepass"
Spiritfarer,You had me at star hat
Spiritfarer,the review is done by a guy with no soul. cannot see the forest for the trees. bet he finds shakespear hard to read or casablanca dull because its not in color.  blech
Spiritfarer,i thought stella was a boy
Spiritfarer,"About 12 hours into the game, I like the slow pace plus that they take away common time limits, so you don’t need to hurry to complete any of the missions. They really put a lot of effort to bring relaxation for player to have connection with each spirits, which is not possible when the pressure is intense."
Spiritfarer,beautiful review
Spiritfarer,30 hours?? I'm still playing and im at 123 hours 😨
Spiritfarer,"Its on sale, for $3 in my country!! Lowest its ever been, Am gonna buy it, thanks for the review james <3"
Spiritfarer,I LOVE this game
Spiritfarer,"Playing the game can be such a spiritual experience. It doesn't shy away from heavy topics but approaches them with a solemnity I didn't expect from such a cartoony-looking game. There's a rewarding though bittersweet feeling to the game. I agree with the comparison to Stardew Valley--  if you enjoy a resource management game with a lot of heart, give it a try."
Spiritfarer,"In conclusion, yes it's worth it. A great game that teaches a difficult lesson to learn, which is to move on and say goodbye. A game where you as the player truly feel connected to others, in a wide world to explore. I cried rivers because of how emotional this game can be."
Spiritfarer,hardly ever had a game make me cry but this game made me ball
Spiritfarer,with the lily update you can sail at night after delivering 8 spirits
Spiritfarer,Is this game controller only?
Spiritfarer,do you know games similar to this?
Spiritfarer,I tried the demo and I love the concept but the controls were too bad to me so I deleted it. I LOVE the music and the story so I will just watch a play through.
Spiritfarer,"No one:
Not even a single soul:
Not even daffodil:
Not even SpongeBob:
Stella: I JUMP ON UMBRELLAS!"
Spiritfarer,i will be nice if you care for the spirits not play farming simulator a most all the time ...
Spiritfarer,"Once my game glitched and Bruce & Mickey were half inside one building, half inside another. When I tried moving one of the buildings, Bruce & Mickey’s front half stayed in place, but the back half disappeared. I had to go to sleep in the game to get them to be fully intact lol"
Spiritfarer,Does it worth 15$?
Spiritfarer,"I loved in particular how Atul left because it's similar to how my father did. It really did hit hard, especially since I latched onto him"
Spiritfarer,"Man! What a solid, well-rounded review. Great job!"
Spiritfarer,"I would love to see this game adapted into a movie, the animation is so pleasant while the music is so touching!"
Spiritfarer,"I loved SDV, I can't remember how many cumulative hours I put into that game. I hope this one delivers that same immersion. Especially now, in a world full of watered down ""triple A"" games."
Spiritfarer,I just hope this game goes up in value in 15-20 years.  I bought 100 @ $16.99 and hope they go north of $100 each. 😂
Spiritfarer,The game seems like just grind grind and grind. It's probably not my type of game but it's just chores
Spiritfarer,This review is infinitely better than any steaming hot garbage ign would of pulled together.
Spiritfarer,"Just got it because it's on sale right now, around 13€. Can't wait :)"
Spiritfarer,"All i could think was

""if they think it's bad. IT WAS WORTH IT TO ME"""
Spiritfarer,I really enjoy this game. I'm not quite finished with it yet but my favorite spirit so far is Stanley. He is such a sweet little kid and I know I'm gonna cry when I bring him to the everdoor.
Spiritfarer,This game is worth it. Haven’t even watched the vid yet
Spiritfarer,"So glad I bought this game it's one to chill with and take in. 

Though some of the repeat animations feel tedious, you do move on enough to not feel too laborious"
Spiritfarer,"I must admit that despite its flaws I absolutely adore this game. I enjoy resource management games quite a bit, and I gravitate towards games that are heavily story-driven anyway. I remember watching the release trailer last year and being instantly intrigued by the game, but I stayed away from spoilers as much as I could so I could go into it (mostly) blind. I finally got the chance to pick it up and play it a few weeks ago, and it was well worth the wait. 

I 100% agree with your comments on how well the game handles progression. I tend to find that with some resource management games there can be a lot of downtime while waiting for certain tasks to finish. I never felt this with Spiritfarer: tasks don’t take long to complete, and there’s always something to do so even when it’s simple tasks like cutting wood or weaving at the loom it feels like you’re making progress. I also like the way that you can increase your yield from certain tasks with practice in timing, which is a nice little reward whenever you pull it off. 

Spoilers Ahead:

In particular though, it was the roster of characters that really made the game for me. No character felt like they weren’t fleshed out, and over the course of my playthrough I came to love each of them for their quirks and traits. It felt like building a family, and it was equally heartbreaking and moving whenever it came to saying goodbye to them. I think the way the game handles the aftermath of the characters moving on is perfect in its own right: characters are rarely mentioned after the fact, but their absence is felt through their empty houses, through the lack of their presence around the boat or through interacting with their door instead of with the character to start an event. It’s not in-your-face, but it’s a small reminder of the character.
   I didn’t know the story of the game going into it, so it caught me a little off guard coming to the realisation that Stella was a palliative care nurse in life and that the spirits are largely those of patients she cared for. I’m a nurse, although not in palliative care, and so being able to connect with the story of the main character made the game that little bit more potent for me. There are definitely plenty of patients that I’ve lost who’s memories have stayed with me, and so it was in a small part vindicating to play as someone who shares those experiences. It was a very emotional playthrough, but in all good ways, and I think the way I connected with the story lets me overlook the game’s few flaws."
Spiritfarer,"What a huge Disappointment this turned out to quickly be. If you think you are in for a deep and immersive game. Well after only minutes you realize that what you see is not going anywhere fast.
An extremely slow paced Indie game that might seem to offer a new feeling to a new game. Yet in reality you are facing imminent boredom. Your ship is an awkward cut out that belongs in a pop up book.
Your only excitement which repeats annoyingly, is trying to catch something flying by you.
You soon hope that you will find out that the game will open up if you can just reach shore. Wrongful thinking. You find out that the pointless point and click on land, was designed for 7 year olds from the start. Achievements are zero as you find one belittling item and have to rush back to that .,*&= ship again. 
No I do not recommend this game to any age groups. It’s shallow and frustrating how unadventurous a game can become. I’m actually writing this more out of frustration, seeing it on Editors choice, where it certainly sh not be."
Spiritfarer,Gonna buy this masterpiece’s deluxe edition with granny’s pocket money I got yesterday
Spiritfarer,"I just finnished the game a couple days ago and I played on switch lite, (could possbily occur on the normal switch) and I had technical diffucutlties where the game would randomly crash on me when I was progressing with adding more spirits. I did let the devs know about the issue and it's fairly common on that type of console. So that is something to be aware of when playing on the switch cause it was something I was not aware of."
Spiritfarer,I just got the game today and quickly fell in love with it. I played 5 and a half hours in one afternoon and could not wait to progress further into the story. The game is beautiful and gives off a warm and cozy vibe like Stardew Valley for me. It was well worth the price tag.
Spiritfarer,Who else’s favorite character is Atul?
Spiritfarer,It's now on sale for 15$ but why is it over 6 GB large -_- it's a 2D platformer...
Spiritfarer,"I really wish they'd used stellas guitar more often, it would have been lovely aswell to get the little themes for each spirit once they passed on, so you could play them on the guitar."
Spiritfarer,The music is made by i think Vincent Diamanté who also made the music in Sky: Children of the Light which is also a relaxing game with also good graphics like Spiritfarer.
Spiritfarer,I played undertale so i love myself some good characters!
Spiritfarer,THE BEST REVIEW
Spiritfarer,You know you need to eat more if you hold up your hat and you started to fly.
Spiritfarer,"Nice review!
I played the demo, and wanted it to be longer, so that's a good sign. I just hope all the farming/crafting stuff doesn't get tedious.
It's $15 on Steam now, so I think I'll pick it up."
Spiritfarer,OMG FANTASTIC REVIEW THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR HELP AND INFO THIS IS AMAZING
Spiritfarer,"I played the game, definitely one of the most emotional and unique experiences I had in videogames in recent years. (But nothing is comparable to Stardew Valley)."
Spiritfarer,Good game for someone who has depression.
Spiritfarer,"ESRB label includes ""Language Warning"". Can anyone here tell me if the Lord's name is taken in vain by any of the characters in Spiritfarer?"
Spiritfarer,How legible is the text on handheld?
Spiritfarer,Hahaha i just passed 50 hours and im still not done with this game
Spiritfarer,"Honestly, I just happened across the game today while perusing some of the summer Indy deals, and I have to say it deffffinitely and instantaneously gave me Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki vibes and both my five year old and I were both just sitting there agog like: “yes, we should play this together” :) Thanks for the honest review, definitely informative and truthful ; thank you :)"
Spiritfarer,"Great review! I like how balanced you were, and analytical without spoiling plot points. I strongly agree with your ""nitpicking"" poinits and positive suggestion to play the game slowly. (^-^)"
Spiritfarer,"When Atul said his favorite past time...was hanging out with his children on the couch while they cuddled up on him while snacking on popcorn and watching movies...and how it's something he will forever miss...whew booyyy those water works came strong. I legit turned off the game, sat on the couch, called my toddlers over and we watched the film luca and had a laugh and some popcorn. I hugged them soo tight...that resonated with me soo much. Due to my poor health I came waaay too close to losing my life too many times. I related with Atul missing his kids soo much. I know I'll be an Atul too...one day soon.  💔"
Spiritfarer,"*small spoiler warning for the beginning of the game!*


the spirit that made me cry on the ride to the ever door was gwen. she was the first person who introduces you to the game and i grew such an attachment to her, that when she asked to go i felt like we didn’t have enough time together :("
Spiritfarer,I LEGIT CRIED WHEN I LET GO OF STANLEY NGHHGH
Spiritfarer,What is the game call? 🤔🤔😳
Spiritfarer,"Is Spiritfarer worth it? 

Of course it is - me"
Spiritfarer,Its a ghibli like experience in game.
Spiritfarer,Its hella boring game that causes me to pass out and oMYGOOSH the amount of blah blah blah from characters is dumb
Gorogoa,Game Pass found me this review :-D
Gorogoa,Loved this beautiful game
Gorogoa,Game Pass in da house! Who else came here because of Game Pass?
Gorogoa,Game Pass gang!
Gorogoa,Love this game man
Gorogoa,Masterpiece
Gorogoa,Interesting game but barely more than an hour long huh?
Gorogoa,"Loved this game so much, took me too look deep into life. Amazing, although you could've gave it like a 8.7 or 8.8"
Gorogoa,This is the kind of game you show to the ones who rabble about how video games rot your brain.
Gorogoa,"Also try Florence if you like Gorogoa, different but in the same vein, relaxing chill gameplay."
Gorogoa,"I won't never forget my Gorogoa experience. For 20 minutes or so I was astonished. The artwork, multi-layered conceptual overlaps, esoteric plot, immersive soundtrack and intuitive puzzle design make the game a complete master class on video game design."
Gorogoa,Nothing but trailer footage....
Gorogoa,wish more games like these but longer
Gorogoa,"I would like to see more games on the level of creative interactivity as this game.  It was such a breath of fresh air in a generation filled to the brim with Open World, First Person Shooters, Battle Royales and the like."
Gorogoa,AWESOME GAME.
Gorogoa,Is this on xbox
Gorogoa,Most annoying subtitles ever
Gorogoa,Looks boring
Gorogoa,"Adjust the format a little, but otherwise a good direction for the less talked about games"
Gorogoa,the fastest review in IGN history.
Gorogoa,very interesting concept however it wouldnt be something people could play again
Gorogoa,Nice! Both the review and the game. Gonna buy it.
Gorogoa,Subtitle too big!
Gorogoa,"i finished this game yesterday,"
Gorogoa,Fastest review evar.
Gorogoa,No need for subtitles
Gorogoa,Very pretentious like most indie games these days trying to go to that video games is an art form.
Gorogoa,"Something interesting for an IGN review, games like this usually aren’t reviewed."
Gorogoa,"Without a doubt one of the best games ever made! I hope it gets more recognition. Even if you're not a gamer you should try this one. There's very little replayability but if you do go back you will gain a further understanding of the actual deepness and complexity of the story, even though it doesn't seem that apparent at first. I know I'm in danger of overhyping this game but then again when I think about how amazing the game is that's not really a danger at all. You need to play this at least once before you die."
Gorogoa,This was such a pleasant experience. It was so creative and beautiful.
Gorogoa,< 3
Gorogoa,This is very creative
Gorogoa,Cool looking game
Gorogoa,Zero replayability but amazing experience nonetheless.
Gorogoa,nope. my monkey brain cant handle this
Gorogoa,I deleted this game thirty seconds into playing it. No thanks.
Gorogoa,Loved this review! Thanks for the visuals!
Gorogoa,I def want this for some reason it reminds me of Myst and Riven.
Gorogoa,fantastic explanation mate. Made me want to buy the game.
Gorogoa,"Wow, coming across this video after hundreds of SwitchUp videos feels like a belated face reveal. Cheers Mark SEEEEYAAAAAA"
Gorogoa,"I love this game! I only wish it was longer, because I love puzzle games and finished it in 2 days."
Gorogoa,It's not a puzzle game. It's not a game. It's a mindless clickfest best suited to someone high on shrooms...
Gorogoa,"Nice game.
You don't need a Switch.
Get it from the Playstore."
Gorogoa,"On sale in the eshop, 50 percent off, for $7.49 until 5/28/20."
Gorogoa,My friend code is - SW -7489-3984-2967
Gorogoa,"Recently played Florence, it was short but I loved every second. Have to take a look at this one."
Gorogoa,"I have never, never, played a puzzler like this.  It's unreal.  The story is strange and cryptic, and the mechanics keep challenging you.  The sense of accomplishment is epic. Absolutely buy this."
Gorogoa,"Oh god 😣 iv gotta stop looking at your reviews 😂 just finished valhalla interesting game, sluggish but the visuals make up for the sluggish"
Gorogoa,Another game for a hidden gems video😎👍
Gorogoa,Incredible game. Very difficult to describe because it doesn't really belong to a genre like you say
Gorogoa,"I think it's too soon to be calling a new game underrated, but yeah, it could use more publicity."
Gorogoa,I love your videos I watch them everyday! What is your friend code?
Gorogoa,"A great, totally underrated game!"
Vampire Survivors,Most mindless fun I've had in years
Vampire Survivors,Liked it very much
Vampire Survivors,It's really mind-blowing. Sharmistha
Vampire Survivors,It's really mind-blowing
Vampire Survivors,This game looks so boring....I don't get is popularity
Vampire Survivors,The reviewer has some terrible build.
Vampire Survivors,.. And now in Hindsight.. Bafta award 👏👏👏
Vampire Survivors,It’s basically Gauntlet on steroids.
Vampire Survivors,No disrespect but how did this win game of the year at the BAFTAs
Vampire Survivors,"Just shows, graphics are not everything, bafta game of the year, well done xbox"
Vampire Survivors,The BAFTA was rigged lol
Vampire Survivors,Bad game how this is game game of year2023.dead space or resident evil 4 game of year 2023 winners.
Vampire Survivors,It won best game
Vampire Survivors,BAFTA ???
Vampire Survivors,"It is an exaggerated game.
Brotato is so much better and beautiful game."
Vampire Survivors,"welcome back to 1990.. No thanks, this game is pain in my eyes.. lol"
Vampire Survivors,"This game, Hollow Knight and Hades are 3 are the best value for money games ever made. Absolutely brilliant."
Vampire Survivors,DLC level is dope!!!
Vampire Survivors,This looks boring as hell. 🤦🏽‍♂️
Vampire Survivors,Just downloaded the game and it seems there's double the content than what was in this video. You should definitely go back and review this game for a 2nd time!! Get hooked all over again
Vampire Survivors,Ok...was wondering what all the hoopla was about.
Vampire Survivors,"Apparently, the person who made this used to work with slot machines. They definitely channeled that addictive energy and enticing magic those machines had with this game!"
Vampire Survivors,Reminds me of survivor io
Vampire Survivors,Please put this game on the switch!
Vampire Survivors,Still not on Playstation
Vampire Survivors,I'd buy that for a dollar.
Vampire Survivors,The game is comple! RE-REVIEW! XD
Vampire Survivors,Must play of 2022 !!!
Vampire Survivors,great joke bro
Vampire Survivors,"The globe, space, aliens, dinosaurs, evolution, gravity and the entire heliocentric model are all lies"
Vampire Survivors,Whack!😮‍💨
Vampire Survivors,$3 doesn't do justice to this game where more mediocre games are being sold for higher prices. Indie devs are really innovating the game industry.
Vampire Survivors,"This game is addictive and really fun, if you haven’t yet play it!"
Vampire Survivors,What's the big deal with this game? Its looks like some rubbish boring mobile game. Why are people so obsessed with it?
Vampire Survivors,Someone invented a mobile game on PC. What an achievement.
Vampire Survivors,"7, for one of the best games I’ve played all year and best indie since Hades

Yikes"
Vampire Survivors,Nope much better games that are t outdated  to waste my time on
Vampire Survivors,This looks like a 80s arcade joint. I’m having trouble finding the reason why this is so popular rightnow lol
Vampire Survivors,this is not like Rogue at all
Vampire Survivors,Literally watching this as my build is on the other screen winning for me without any input from me lol
Vampire Survivors,It’s obscene how many hours I’ve put into this on my Steam Deck.
Vampire Survivors,This game is 10/10. The guy who reviewed it is a moron.
Vampire Survivors,Dynasty Warrior 2D.
Vampire Survivors,"So many points are not relevant anymore!   So many new maps, weapons, mobs (who shoot, etc...)  Best 3 euro u can spend in your life!"
Vampire Survivors,Do another video now :D its been few months :D
Vampire Survivors,Incredible game that you can get for $3. The only thing that would make this game better is if it was available on the switch.
Vampire Survivors,Garlic
Vampire Survivors,can my 4090 rtx run this game ???
Vampire Survivors,"7 is a bit harsh; take price and accessibility into account, and review the essence of this experience - a classic video game, surely it's worth 11.09321 out of 11.09339"
Vampire Survivors,"Hard pass.
This game looks like someone's PhD thesis on optimizing games to maximize dopamine production while minimizing actual substance.
It's like a slot or pachinko machine that just takes your time."
Vampire Survivors,dat mutt auf konsole please!🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Vampire Survivors,Thank ammongold tv. Ign don't even act like yall would ever review this game🤣🤣
Vampire Survivors,It’s 3 dollars.
Vampire Survivors,They should make this game multiplayer
Vampire Survivors,"My opinion, buy this game. You will likely spend more money on your next meal that will be gone in like 20mins. This game will have you hooked for hours upon hours, seriously it is so much deeper than it seems on the surface and it keeps getting more stuff."
Vampire Survivors,Reminds me of a mobile game called magic survival.
Vampire Survivors,One should mention the price of $3!
Vampire Survivors,"Gura is right, this didnt deserve the 7/10 it looks like an 8 or 8.5. :)"
Vampire Survivors,like a serious Sam game with serious endurance...
Vampire Survivors,IGN have become the Walmart of game review. It’s when you go when you want a cheap mainstream opinion.
Vampire Survivors,Does this count as action rpg?
Vampire Survivors,"Just trying, no idea thought my right stick was broken 😀"
Vampire Survivors,"for 2 notes tho, probably the best game of all time !?!!!"
Vampire Survivors,Droga!  😁
Vampire Survivors,this game produces serotonin in my monke brain
Vampire Survivors,its only like 2 pounds. And it can take 10 hours+ of full fun unlocks. WELL WORTH IT!!
Vampire Survivors,the latest map is very hard campared to other maps without the anti upgrade
Vampire Survivors,"also there are upgrades ""against"" you"
Vampire Survivors,"there is more cool things now like. a map for items, more maps, structures, acheivments ect so ye"
Vampire Survivors,This game reminds me of Magic Survival on my android phone
Vampire Survivors,Man I’m hooked onto this game bad. “Just one more round”
Vampire Survivors,Dude who made this used to work on poker machines.. He knows how to get those endorphins flowing.
Vampire Survivors,Great when you enjoy playing a pixel to fight other pixesl.
Vampire Survivors,My Fav. Game 🥰
Vampire Survivors,If they added co-op that would be super lit
Vampire Survivors,this game is insane.
Vampire Survivors,This game is Digital Heroin. Don't get fooled by some dumb score.
Vampire Survivors,It's Robotron!
Vampire Survivors,Is it 2D Devil Daggers……cause that sounds sorta amazing 🤩
Vampire Survivors,"Me sees the score 7: *DISLIKED*
Reason: This game is masterpiece and its worth more than $3"
Vampire Survivors,This game is like crack.
Vampire Survivors,Looks better than pokemon arceus
Vampire Survivors,"Biggest con of this game is that it ends. Roguelikes NEED to be infinitely replayable, after 10 hours, you get all achievments, have seen all powerups and bosses, and there is literally nothing left for you to do. Maybe they could do with an endless mode, but it needs to be balanced well enough because this game only has one analog stick as its only input. 

Incredible game for listening to podcasts, had an amazing 10 hours."
Vampire Survivors,This is basically a Castlevania Musou game. Lol
Vampire Survivors,Great developers who work hard to keep updating. A game worth uts money :)
Vampire Survivors,So boring...its a number pop up simulator?
Vampire Survivors,"For a close mobile version of this type of game play magic survival, its just as epic"
Vampire Survivors,Looks like a game from 30-40 years ago hahahaha wtf is this???
Vampire Survivors,This game looks like a 4 year old crayon scribbling contest
Vampire Survivors,Yeaaaàhhh another snes game in 2022.
Vampire Survivors,"The game has almost 97% positive reviews on steam. With 38,031 recommending it and 388 not recommending it. 

Ign : its a 7"
Vampire Survivors,Is it an app game?
Vampire Survivors,Lol wtf is this?!?! 2 PACK OF A$$!!! Stop the 🧢
Vampire Survivors,One of the best values on Steam.  It's a lightning in a bottle sort of situation where the core loop is just so satisfying it doesn't matter that there's (for now) little content and some repetition.  It's a more chilled out Isaac and everyone who likes roguelites should buy it.
Vampire Survivors,"vaporware... and when the comment section is more positive than IGN, you know it's being seeded by fake comments."
Vampire Survivors,thats a lot of castlevania props.
Vampire Survivors,"IGN rate=7, too many projectiles."
Vampire Survivors,"This game has a 99% rating on Steam from over 35K players, still ONE guy at IGN give it a 7..."
Vampire Survivors,Cool and all but I'll wait to see what it becomes rather than burning out on the initial limited content.
Vampire Survivors,👍
Vampire Survivors,This game is addicting the way popping bubble wrap is.
Vampire Survivors,i finally bit the bullet on this game after hearing about it nonstop a few days ago.  yah i play it too often.  great game especially now that the new DLC is out.
Vampire Survivors,Good game. If only it wasn't pixelated
Vampire Survivors,I wonder where that dracula face is robbed
Vampire Survivors,Jaded. Cynical. A great game!
Vampire Survivors,Free on mobile if you like to slay on the go
Vampire Survivors,"Nah, nah its cr*p"
Vampire Survivors,Deus Ex Invisible War for $0.40? You still got ripped off. That game is  bad. It legit sucks.
Vampire Survivors,"Vampire Survivors is so good! Once you start levelling up say goodbye to your life. It's definitely pick up and play with tons of replay value, I'd say it's a classic."
Vampire Survivors,Hack journos trying not to say the thing (“ONE MORE RUN”) as a praise in reviews of permadeath games challenge go:
Vampire Survivors,Anything with that Gauntlet vibe is fine by me
Vampire Survivors,Popped this gem onto the Xbox this morning and didn’t blink for the next five hours. This game is fiendishly addictive.
Vampire Survivors,"100%’d the game in 32 hours. Honestly one of my favourite games of all time, love it. I’d have to say after the main progression curve it takes a tank in enjoyment, but secret unlockables and end game content kept it fresh!"
Vampire Survivors,I did not expect Cruelty Squad to be name dropped in this review out of all the games.
Vampire Survivors,Its complete trash to me but some people think it's GotY.
Vampire Survivors,"They released it on gamepass for those who don't know, the game is really as addictive as people have said. It can be frustrating at the start but that's the catch. The more you play the more you unlocks and naturally you just get stronger. The game is a masterpiece"
Vampire Survivors,tanx 4 the rev
Vampire Survivors,Can't work out this guy's accent
Vampire Survivors,My dad has not played videogames since the 80s and he is completely addicted to this game
Vampire Survivors,"Amazing game!  (Especially for someone who can only use one arm after an injury.)
Only complaint is I wish there was a music shuffle option so it wouldn't loop the same track for 30 mins each time I play."
Vampire Survivors,*roguelite
Vampire Survivors,"The game was developed by someone who worked on software for gambling machines, I think that says a lot about the addictiveness of this game."
Vampire Survivors,didn't jim stephanie sterling fart on this game to give it it's finishing patch?
Vampire Survivors,Why is no one talking about the fact that this game is an asset flip knockoff of a mobile game?
Vampire Survivors,Greatest Game of All-time status.
Citizen Sleeper,"""Above average for a game using the Unity engine"". How many games have you made using Unity? How many games have you made? Do you even remotely know what the engine can and cannot do? Obviously not by your idiotic side-busting of Unity.  As a matter of fact, Disco Elysium is made in UNITY!"
Citizen Sleeper,Disco Elyseum is already sci-fi
Citizen Sleeper,"can't wait until A.I. can be used to voice originally non-voiced games, like the project that voiced the earlier parts of World of Warcraft"
Citizen Sleeper,"If you compare a game to Disco Elysium, there is obviously only one question that viewers will be interested in for the remainder of the video: ""is the writing as good?"" You don't answer this at any point."
Citizen Sleeper,Garbage review. Dude doesn't know wtf he's talking about in regards to Unity and Disco Elysium. Made me immediately dislike and become uninterested in this game.
Citizen Sleeper,"""The graphics are above average for a game using the Unity engine"". ""Navigating a vast abandoned space station as a controllable character would be too much for the Unity engine to handle"". Does this guy even knows what Unity is? Does he even knows which games were developed with Unity?"
Citizen Sleeper,Ripoff acg much
Citizen Sleeper,"You have some genuinely shitty takes in this review, it’s almost feels like you are trolling"
Citizen Sleeper,Completely agree on Disco Elysium's soundtrack. I though it was pure shite
Citizen Sleeper,Thought it looks more like Blade Runner...
Citizen Sleeper,"I find it ironic that Murphy says that Citizen Sleeper is an ""innovation... on the genre"" when referencing Disco Elysium.  Disco Elysium is already an innovation on the cyberpunk genre set out by the Neuromancer book and the Cyberpunk tabletop role-playing games.  It's true that Citizen Sleeper is showing up around the time of a popular cyberpunk game, but saying Disco Elysium is the genre setter is missing where Disco Elysium is coming from."
Citizen Sleeper,"You have so many misconceptions about the Unity engine. Subnautica was made in Unity, Cities: Skylines, Rust, Risk of Rain 2, Ori and The Blind Forest... The computer is the one that needs to ""handle"" the graphics, the engines is a series of tools to make a game. Although yes, it would be hard or impossible  to make a beautiful game in an old engine, but Unity is a new and very updated engine. Some games made in it look ugly, but because the engine, being free, is used by amateurs more frequently."
Citizen Sleeper,The soundtrack is the highlight of the game. I still listen to it daily.
Citizen Sleeper,is it a review or spoiler fountain?
Citizen Sleeper,"Concerning this is supposed to be a RPG, I missed a comment on character development.  Also it looks more like a visual novel style with small riddle like actions, less than a game where the player tries to act through a protagonist.  I know from other review, that there are RPG elements, and as you mentioned the story is well written, but... Well, I sometimes wonder if nowadays a developer just needs to combine a few skills to the protagonist that can be altered and/or grown, a plot to follow with some decisions and story-telling to call the game an RPG.  To me it looks more like an adventure game with a few RPG elements, but to understand more what this game is trying to do I need more information, or buy and play it myself.  The setting and idea seem interesting enough, although I hardly understand the gameplay as presented so far."
Citizen Sleeper,Disco Elysiums soundtrack is not forgettable at all idk how you’d come to that conclusion.
Citizen Sleeper,I absolutely LOVE this game.  In some ways I think it is actually better than Disco Elysium.  The skills in Citizen Sleeper are intuitive whereas the skills in Disco Elysium are so bizarre and ambiguous that I often have absolutely no idea whether putting points into it ia actually worthwhile.
Citizen Sleeper,Really dig the concise and clear review you did here. Thank you for a good preview before buying.
Citizen Sleeper,"It has words. It has dice. Therefore ITS JUST LIKE DISCO ELYSIUM GUYS.
Idiot."
Citizen Sleeper,"""soundtract"" is not a word"
Citizen Sleeper,"hey dude, not to be mean, but don't use unity engine in your arguments if you don't know what it is or what it means to use it."
Citizen Sleeper,Game is nothing like Disco Elysium. It's more like Fallen London
Citizen Sleeper,Bad review
Citizen Sleeper,I came to the conclusion long ago that the simplest of pixels on a screen could tug at the emotions when I played Thomas Was Alone.
Citizen Sleeper,"is the dialogue like Disco Elysium?  I mean in DE there was a lot of layers in the dialogue, it was very deep and philosophical with a lot of choices for the character."
Citizen Sleeper,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzitizen sleeper indeed.
Citizen Sleeper,Lem is my favorite character
Citizen Sleeper,"Finished it in a 8 hour run and got a chance at all the endings while doing so, chose one I liked so you don't really need to replay it unless your picked ending is one of the ones that show up early on. 
And personally this song is very memorable to me when i got the ending i wanted.  Possible Futures · Amos Roddy"
Citizen Sleeper,"more like Resident Sleeper, HA"
Citizen Sleeper,"I really think this review is incomplete without mentioning this game's inverse difficulty curve... At the start, the premise feels incredibly tangible and real, as the slow decay of your body limits your Action Dice and ability to interact. There are several ""negative"" timers keeping you on your toes, you're low on cash and the little you do earn, you have to spend on food or very expensive Stabilizer. As time goes on however, and you resolve more and more questlines while upgrading your Sleeper with ""+1"" modifiers and character perks, the game's gameplay becomes so easy as to basically be a time-consuming chore. You're no longer making meaningful decisions about prioritising certain quest-lines over others depending on your Condition, Energy and Cryo. You can do everything! Even the planned obsolescence of your body becomes a joke, especially with the engineering perk ""Self Repair"" which completely nullifies the mechanic (scrap has many sources and is very easy to acquire). Once you unlock it, you basically never need Stabilizers, and have 5 Action Dice available at all times. It ruins the feeling of the story, as the characters' wistful, downtrodden dialogue about being poor or sympathy for your terminal condition are a jarring contrast to your abundance of resources and full self-sustainability. By the time the game presented me with alternative ways to produce Stabilizer (and the story framed this as a big deal), I already DIDN'T NEED IT, because of the broken Self Repair perk! The impact of this moment was completely neutered, as the character reflected on being a slave to the Stabilizer which I hadn't needed in over 20 cycles..."
Citizen Sleeper,"man, the beef you got with unity is really showing, unity is an amazing engine, with good capabilities"
Citizen Sleeper,I'm just pissed u cant disable autosave
Citizen Sleeper,Great review but the soundtrack actually slaps hard
Citizen Sleeper,"The review wasn't bad, but I couldn't resist giving it a thumbs down after the multiple uneducated takes on game engines."
Citizen Sleeper,Short playthrough time is not a problem if the story and content is solid. A lot of games drag out too long.
Citizen Sleeper,Graphics are good enough for this type of game. It’s more about the style that matters. This game’s art style looks really nice.
Citizen Sleeper,Discos soundtrack is amazing
Citizen Sleeper,"and its a commie game like disco elysium, you are not kidding about it being like disco elysium."
Citizen Sleeper,If I wanted to play a board game. Why not play a board game? I think I’m aging out.
Citizen Sleeper,Looks like it hits all the right spots. Definitely picking this up.
Citizen Sleeper,"Nice review, but it's very obvious you have zero clue about Unity. Or little understanding of the technical side of the development in general. Those takes were quite cringe-inducing.

Unity is good enough to handle AAA quality of visuals, and a variety of art styles. It's all about the studio's budget, art direction and available skillset.
Likewise, the lack of player avatar has *nothing* to do with the engine choice. It's purely a question of gameplay and project scope/budget.

Otherwise, cool review, thanks."
Citizen Sleeper,"Good review, thanks for the video."
Citizen Sleeper,Keep in mind these type of games aren't for everyone and that's ok..
Citizen Sleeper,"nice video dude ;) Just to point a little thing (is actually a nitpicking) I'm starting to study game design and my main engine is Unity engine, and actually a lot of 3A with realistic graphics are made in it. So when you point that the graphics are ""above average for unity engine,"" it does not say a lot, because it is a really powerfull engine even with photorealistic graphics. Anyway, your analysis is so great, gj"
Citizen Sleeper,It’s too bad they used such a limited game engine
Citizen Sleeper,Thanks for the review. Looks like I'm skipping this one
Citizen Sleeper,"I really hope this game becomes super beloved like DE, so it could maybe get an Expanded Edition with Voice Acting."
Citizen Sleeper,"Thumbs down for this review because of the idiocit claims about Unity enging. After hearing for the second time that something coudn't be done because of Unity I just coudnt take it anymore.
Just FYI some games made on Unity:
Escape from Tarkov
RUST
7 Days to Die
Valheim
Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous
etc.
So... yeah. I have no idea what engine has to do with this game but whatever. 
As for the game itself - Already preordered. Looks great. But MY GOD I'll never watch anything from this channel"
Citizen Sleeper,I've never heard anything but lavish praise for the Disco Elysium Soundtrack. Incredibly memorable and evocative.
Citizen Sleeper,"you really have no idea what the unity engine is, do you? :D some nintendo games are built on it. it's fine that the game chose this art- and gameplay style, but it has nothing to do with an engine limitation. the unity engine is awesome, if used well."
Citizen Sleeper,3:12  ''sound tract'' lol.
Citizen Sleeper,Hey great review. I'm pretty excited for this game.
Citizen Sleeper,"Love this channel - subscribed!
I've had this game based on the recommendation of a podcaster (Scott Johnson at Frogpants) I follow.  With CS2 being announced at the Summer Fest Show, I'm even more intrigued in playing, especially considering how short of a game it is."
Citizen Sleeper,"""kind of like dungeons and dragons but without worrying about the theatre of the mind.""
thats a terrible description, for one 'the theatre of the mind' is the best part of dnd, for two its nothing like dnd. its not trying to be dnd at all."
Citizen Sleeper,Oh my God I'm so glad I found your channel I am a people and I am busy.. hope your channel grows! Definitely turning on notifications. Moat of my gaming is done on PS5 and steam deck.
Citizen Sleeper,"Good stuff, thanks for the review!~"
Citizen Sleeper,I hope this channel takes off. All us x and y peeps are busy at work now and the snes is breaking so we need nice games to squeeze into our lives.
Citizen Sleeper,"While having my own startup business, I’m only able to spend midnight time to play game after long day. Where I find your channel is great for people like us, please do more about good game for busy people, keep the good work!"
Citizen Sleeper,I’m echoing a lot of other peoples’ sentiments here but: what an awesome idea for a channel. This was a great review and I appreciate you taking into account how busy people are! Good shit my guy
Citizen Sleeper,You face blue
Citizen Sleeper,Really good channel but I would recommend editing your username to reflect what your videos are about. It will attract more people here quickly!
Citizen Sleeper,I'm soooooooooo busy but love gaming... This channel is my sweet spot
Citizen Sleeper,This channel is underrated because I am extremely busy nowadays but i always wanna play games 🥲 I actually picked this game up  when it was on sale
Citizen Sleeper,The only thing you’re missing- is you need to tell us what platforms these are on.
Citizen Sleeper,"Deathloop short brought me here. Instant subscriber. Easy to watch, easy to follow, very informative. Keep up the great work!"
Citizen Sleeper,"saw your deathloop short. Amazing recommendations but my train-wreck laptop is in disagreement with me. Therefore, this recommendation of citizen sleeper is gold to me. Thanks a lot"
Citizen Sleeper,"Just saw your short on deathloop and the whole idea of this channel is a godsend to me.
Definetly will be here for a while!"
Ikaruga,my favorite bird is the big bird from sesme street
Ikaruga,"my favorit bird is the tall fruity owl from hazbin hotel

Also, what's the track that plays at 9:37?"
Ikaruga,"I don't know why I didn't found you sooner.
You accurately depicted how I felt playing Ikaruga."
Ikaruga,I need that full space jam stonelike cover link please.
Ikaruga,I like the chicken hawk
Ikaruga,Crows 4 Lyfe
Ikaruga,This is a great game… nice review guy
Ikaruga,Ikaruga? Autism? I feel seen.
Ikaruga,0:54 nice soul hackers music
Ikaruga,"Yo this video is amazing, holy, subbed."
Ikaruga,Do you have the tracklist for all the music featured in this video?
Ikaruga,Jesus that was one of the best reviews iv ever seen
Ikaruga,"Bruh, this video is straight fire. Love me some Treasure. 
Do you have the name of the song that plays before Electric Toothbrush, around 0:54 ? Thanks
Peace and see you around"
Ikaruga,"This is the second video I've seen of yours after FF7. All I gotta say is keep it up. You've got to the potential to be one of the great ones online. I enjoy the commentary, video choices and comedy. Can I recommend Rez next, another what was once originally a Dreamcast game? Take care."
Ikaruga,"What a delight, to be surprised by a roast of Maddox in the middle of an already beautifully edited Ikaruga retrospective! What more could I want from a video? I like Cardinals, because they are red, and have cool hair."
Ikaruga,"Owls, because they're as adorable and cute and floofy as they are dumdums but that's ok"
Ikaruga,i like touhou
Ikaruga,"I'm not gay, but I'm glad you made this video.  This game is/was great!  Shame people got to play it on Xbox 360, though"
Ikaruga,"""deal with it or go play Lego Star Wars or some shit"". might be the best line i've ever heard, like in anything, in my whole life lol. and im kinda old ;D. i am totally going to steal that line and use it irl for non gaming related things. xD i will give you credit every time i do. i literally had to pause the video to absorb how awesome it was. im just picturing Gordon Ramsey as the voice of Ikaruga saying ""get the #$*% out of my kitchen and go microwave a hotpocket you tiny baby!"" the whole context and delivery and the game itself just made it over the top hilarious to me for some reason. like it knows its nearly impossible and wants to taunt you. like its saying, dont just go play something a little less hard, go play Lego Stars wars cause thats all you deserve you total scrub xD. If you fail hard enough in Ikaruga the game automatically mails you a copy of Lego starwars, that it paid for with its own money, just to taunt you more. ok i'll stop lol thumbs up"
Ikaruga,"bro, you're the best youtuber ever"
Ikaruga,"We need more content creators like you, this man’s out here doing god’s work with his design choices in editing, not to mention the fact that you’re giving one of my favorite games ever justice!!!

You deserve the title of “King” my good sir, Subbed!!! ✌🏽"
Ikaruga,Harpy Eagle.
Ikaruga,You need more subs
Ikaruga,Here from Mista GG. Love Ikaruga and love this video! Also I like blue jays
Ikaruga,I love this game
Ikaruga,"WTF i love this channel

My favourite bird is the the Toucan. Big beak looking ass"
Ikaruga,"My favourite bird is the untitled goose.

Also great video, but that clip of movie bob made my throw up a bit."
Ikaruga,You deserve at least a begellion more views. What the heck
Ikaruga,I love Ravens and Crows UwU
Ikaruga,Criminally underviewed
Ikaruga,Sonic mega collection music fire
Ikaruga,How the fuck has this channel not got more subscribers?
Ikaruga,"i like the peregine falcon

Ikaruga,"I looked up raidiant silvergun and it's playable on Xbox One, I know what I'm doing!"
Ikaruga,My favorite bird is pingu the penguin from my favorite show Pingu
Ikaruga,my favorite bird is the blue bird from normal show
Ikaruga,My favorite bird is the halbird from kevin
Ikaruga,My favorite bird is the Inca tern. Just look at those funny little mustaches.
Ikaruga,Haven’t played this since Dreamcast. But been fiending to replay. It’s ~$8 on Japanese eShop now. Think I’ll bite!
Ikaruga,**S O N I C????**
Ikaruga,Here because of Sonic Frontiers of all things.
Ikaruga,Is it worth $160 for a physical copy though…
Ikaruga,"Radiant silvergun
Soukyuu Gurentai"
Ikaruga,0:54 Puzzle game there he said the thing.
Ikaruga,I just could never really get into this game. I’m here just to see if I’m the only one. Apparently I am🤷🏾‍♂️
Ikaruga,"I just bought a Switch yesterday. I bought this game, this morning. Mind blown!"
Ikaruga,worth noting that this game has my favorite OST of all time
Ikaruga,I cant find a physical copy anywhere in my city. I will have to order it online if I want a physical copy. It is going on sale for 9.99 on the nintendo eshop at the moment though.
Ikaruga,"update: there's phsysical copy coming out for switch, PS4 and limited edition package only in japan late this year.."
Ikaruga,Ikaruga is a MASTERPIECE!
Ikaruga,"“i died so many times i thought i was gonna run out of infinite lives”
-VideoGameDunkey. and i entirely agree with him"
Ikaruga,"My quick mini-review: 
 Ikaruga is a classic arcade game that’s been ported and re-ported from platform to platform. The first time I played it was on the Sega Dreamcast. 
 —Is it good? Yep. It’s a great, classic arcade-y shmup. If you like shmups, go for it. Its instant frenetic action, pick-up-n-play simplicity, and unique color-changing mechanic have given it more personality and staying power than its peers. 
 —Is it a must-buy? When it’s on sale, it’s definitely worth a look. When it’s not, you won’t regret the purchase. Even after all these years, it’s a worthy addition to your gaming collection."
Ikaruga,What are other similar games similar on switch?
Ikaruga,"Pro tip for ""restarts""

In extra options set ""easy menu"" on! That gets rid off 2 selection screens, keeps your previous choices and makes it waaay faster and less tedious to try again by exiting to the menu"
Ikaruga,Ikaruga is on sale at the moment in the eStore. (22nd Jan 2020)
Ikaruga,What we REALLY need is North American release of Mushihimesama.
Ikaruga,the most racially charged shmup since touhou 15
Ikaruga,"ahead of it's time no doubt, too bad it's kinda short"
Ikaruga,Now all we need is radient silver Gun on switch
Ikaruga,"I have adhd and this is the kind of game that just suits my brain perfectly, it's like a workout for the mind and I'm totally in the zen mode when playing! :D"
Ikaruga,"Just picked this up for the PS4  retro sale, I've been meaning to pick this up years."
Ikaruga,"For those coming to this video beyond June 15th, they are releasing a physical edition for Switch and PS4 coming soon."
Ikaruga,Hopefully they'll port Radiant Silvergun too
Ikaruga,Wait. There's a switch port?
Ikaruga,Just beat chapter five without using a continue. It took 40 hours of attempts. Now on to the 1cc
Ikaruga,This game has not aged ONE DAY!!  Still have my original Gamecube copy. Gameplay is amazing and highly addictive. Graphics look like they were made yesterday. This is the game that got me interested in shoot em ups. Timeless!!
Ikaruga,Is this popular on steam?
Ikaruga,"A Treasure compilation would be, well, a treasure!"
Ikaruga,This is merely the first step of a GameCube virtual console
Ikaruga,I LOVE YOUR AWESOME ATTITUDE!!
Ikaruga,"A great review!! I will buy this game thanks to your review, thank you, and LIKE."
Ikaruga,I'm playing this game right now on a dreamcast with my TV turned sideways!
Ikaruga,Outland meets sine mora?
Ikaruga,Actually got a hold of the GC version today. I'll probably pick up the Switch version because it's a steal and it's on the go as well.
Ikaruga,"Wait, so you can just TURN ON INFINITE CONTINUES WHENEVER YOU WANT?! Can someone please tell me this is true! I've been trying to unlock infinite continues on my GameCube version for two years now and I just don't the time, nor the patience to play the game for a solid 7 FREAKING HOURS!"
Ikaruga,"This game is getting hype all over, and as much as I love shmups, I just can't get past the visuals. I'm not really sure why. It's almost like they look ""homemade"", if that makes sense, like the game was created on some kind of third-party software by someone in a couple of hours."
Ikaruga,"I thought I was good at videogames until I bought this. I've been playing it for over a year, and still haven't finished it! The level of focus you have to keep is unreal"
Ikaruga,I found out about the switch version just now through the eshop. This game should be promoted a whole lot more
Ikaruga,"lol ""Most of us"" had a PS2, stop acting like Gamecube owners didn't live in the same basement as Dreamcast owners"
Ikaruga,What’s better ikaruga or sky force reloaded?
Ikaruga,"It was either this or just shapes and beats.
I pick dubstep"
Ikaruga,Glad to see this game getting another chance; I heard so many good things. But having only 5 stages is a big turn off I have to admit.
Ikaruga,"porting a game that came out in 2001...sure, it's a great game, but I want new shit for the Switch"
Ikaruga,A true dreamcast classic! Now we need bangai-o for switch
Ikaruga,"Still got my gamecube copy!
Now I can take it anywhere! woop woop!"
Ikaruga,Are you fucking blind. It’s red and blue
Ikaruga,TATE mode confirmed?  This is probably a 'buy' for me then.  Is it just me or are the devs of the game CRAZY for not mentioned TATE mode compatibility on the eShop's store page for this game???
Ikaruga,Retail Version?
Ikaruga,Wait is this Touhou 7? Lmao
Ikaruga,"*As much as I love this game, I already have 3 consoles that can play it. I don't need to buy Ikaruga again*"
Ikaruga,Yeah this game is awesome. I want the cart!
Ikaruga,I stole money from my mom back in the day to get this on GCN
Ikaruga,"I'm interested in this but will wait for a deep sale, for a game you can finish in half an hour it's very overpriced."
Ikaruga,now i need to see radiant silvergun on the switch ! it's a dream
Ikaruga,"You Deserve an Award for reviewing a difficult game with out any mention/comparisons to dark souls ;) GG, will buy for sure."
Ikaruga,Everything is professional except for your voice
Ikaruga,First played this on the 360. Getting my ass whooped was never so much fun.
Ikaruga,Brilliant Review GX. Ikaruga is plain and simple a classic SHMUP and i am so glad too see it on the Nintendo Switch.
Ikaruga,The Dreamcast original was some of the best gaming of my life. A true masterpiece.
Ikaruga,Does this just have free play straight out the box then ? If so its wasted . Earning that right and extra credits is what makes this magical.
Ikaruga,"Ha, is this from gamecube?"
Ikaruga,"""Mind-blowingly difficult."" That's the review grab."
Ikaruga,"Since I know there's no way in hell I'll ever top the real leaderboard, I thought I'd see where I could have got to in this one (see 3:01) and...would have made it to the ""top""! (Although I see some of those guys have since improved - but I still just sneaked ahead of NomComms new score).

Nice review, by the way. Really, really loving the game so far, and I totally agree that the leaderboards add a whole new reason to keep coming back. Little thing, but it adds a really addictive element to the already great gameplay."
Ikaruga,Just bought the FUCK out of this. I remember owning the GameCube version.. This game is incredible. I wish someone would make a physical copy of it though..
Ikaruga,DEFINITELY MIGHT PICK IT UP
Ikaruga,"I love these reviewers, there honest about their skill level and how it being too hard isn't a bad thing"
Ikaruga,"Nice review. 3:02 I am Sonic, haha. Beaten that score since then. Ikaruga is a real gem."
Ikaruga,"Idk... Switch just lacks top tier games except for Zelda, xeno 2 anda Mario Odyssey.. :("
Ikaruga,Kyotekei on Switch needs to happen
Ikaruga,"One aspect that I didn't see get mentioned was Dot Eater, where you get a score bonus for not shooting once, and just focusing on dodging/absorbing everything."
Ikaruga,Arghhhhh you guys are covering Switch now. My channel is doomed lol! Great review though! Mark
Ikaruga,I’ve never had a seizure in my life save for every single time I’ve ever played ikaruga
Ikaruga,Ikaruga is an absolute masterpiece.
Ikaruga,Ikaruga is a master piece. Bought already.
Ikaruga,Best version of Ikaruga hands down. That vertical virw is just phenomenal
Ikaruga,I'd like to see a Starfox bullet hell game.
Ikaruga,Still such a beautiful looking game.
Ikaruga,“Tate” 🤦‍♂️
Ikaruga,"Great review, game looks really good. Just so you know, ""Tate mode"" is ""tah-tay"" not ""tait"". Comes from the Japanese 縦 meaning vertical."
Ikaruga,"Huh, neat"
Ikaruga,You seem to be a very good reviewer
Ikaruga,Why did I buy this on steam a few month ago? I should have waited for the Switch version.
Ikaruga,If we only could get gradius V too
Ikaruga,"Buying, i'm excited for this.

Great review gamexplain."
Ikaruga,Ikaruga is the Touhou of Dark-Souls-like shmups.
Ikaruga,Why are you guys reviewing this old ass game?!... it's been on cellphones for years.
Ikaruga,Absolutely loved Ikaruga when I first played it on the Gamecube. I remember that it was a hard copy to find so I had to import mine. Anyone who loves these kinds of games and hasn't tried it should definitely pick this one up.
Ikaruga,"""tate mode"" isn't pronounced tate..sorry for being the obvious weeaboo!"
Ikaruga,I love ikaruga but i want more of radiant silvergun is a nice game too and need to be in the switch
Ikaruga,This is one of those games I always hear a lot about but I never got around to playing it
Ikaruga,4:09 So you do know Alex from Nintendo Life. Nice.
Ikaruga,2:25 The police in a nutshell.
Ikaruga,Ikaruga is misspelled in the description. Just a heads up.
Ikaruga,4:10 “Hello there lovely people..”
Ikaruga,Uuuugh. But I just bought Curse of the Moon. My Switch backlog is piling up...
Ikaruga,Nice game and great fit for the switch. Music isnt remarkeble though.
Ikaruga,Muito massa
Ikaruga,"played this at infinity arcade in Rowland Heights and feel in love. Been playing on the gamecube ever since. Fun technical quick and to the point. Ikaruga owns all in the genre. One of the top videogames, in any genre, ever made."
Terraria,That was created by Nintendo?! 😳
Terraria,They gave it a 9.0 and people still complain lol
Terraria,"Ign makes worst terraria review ever, asked to leave the internet."
Terraria,"What is this f11cking obsession with games having a ""story"". Get an imagination you loser."
Terraria,Goated
Terraria,there kinda is some story...
Terraria,Well still not better than Minecraft
Terraria,Journalism majors....
Terraria,Well this hasn't aged well.
Terraria,I’m pretty sure they changed their mind after the official lore came out right? Right...?
Terraria,Please re-review this! It is so much better after all these years I'm sure your rating with be higher
Terraria,"Terraria came out before Minecraft. How does it take inspiration from Minecraft, when Minecraft didn't even exist at that point. 🙃"
Terraria,Holy hell you people in the comments are the biggest crybabies.
Terraria,Anyone watching this in 2021
Terraria,*over 400 000 reviews disagree*
Terraria,*over 400 000 reviews disagree*
Terraria,*sad update noises 2*
Terraria,"1:25: “Cute little bunnies that you’ll accidentally behead”
*literally murders bunny in cold blood*"
Terraria,9/10 to much nostalgia
Terraria,Ew
Terraria,Who needs story when you go from cave exploring to fighting the lord of moons
Terraria,This game deserves 10/10
Terraria,"NGL old terraria doesn’t look that great, but nowadays this needs to be updated , it’s so much better now."
Terraria,Anyone here during qaurantine?
Terraria,The best game of ALL time
Terraria,"Man they should really update the ""no story"" bit"
Terraria,How have they not re reviewed it but they re reviewed a bunch or remastered games and re reviewed rainbow 6 and overwatch?
Terraria,I don’t get why this game is so popular it looks so bad
Terraria,"Game has updated, and so should this review"
Terraria,">""This sandbox game has no story""
>Shows only footage of the beginning of the game (Probably didn't even finish the game)
>Is only using beginner gear
>Isn't aware of any strategies to beat the bosses
>says ""Clearing draws inspiration from Minecraft"" Even though this has been in development since before Minecraft existed and the only similarities are that zombies come out at night and that you can mine and build stuff

This man clearly did not play the game outisde of an hour or two of the beginning phase."
Terraria,I hate when reviews compare it to minecraft because *OMPH ITS A SANDBOX SURVIVAL???*
Terraria,Minecraft 9/10- No story-IGN
Terraria,Its 10/10 in 2020
Terraria,there no story in mine craft yet they don't criticise that
Terraria,With the  lore its 10/10
Terraria,Can we just imagine if they were to review this now!
Terraria,This game has evolved so so much
Terraria,"with the latest update ""journeys end"" there i NOW a story! Or atleast a whole lot of lore"
Terraria,"Please do another review of terraria, it’s past the final update and the game has changed so much, and this review no longer works with the game"
Terraria,"I, Giorno Giovanna, am angered by this review"
Terraria,Can we appreciate how bad there weapons are that use to fight the eye of Cthulhu
Terraria,It's a little something for everyone
Terraria,For the most part this review ain't bad
Terraria,Terraria minecraft but more mature
Terraria,"ok its a funny review because it has lore not a story, that's like saying hollow knight has no story"
Terraria,Minecraft inspired? This game was in development before minecraft
Terraria,For the 9/10 because of no story because it was not made by a AAA company.
Terraria,2d minecraft...huh?
Terraria,It does have lore tho
Terraria,This review secretly makes everyone triggered
Terraria,"The reviewer has seemingly no emotion, also modern day comment"
Terraria,"“Terraria has no story”
Terraria lore: am I a joke to you?"
Terraria,Should Starbound get a 10/10 because it has a story?
Terraria,My man's called NPCs villagers
Terraria,It has a story now so does that make it a 10/10?
Terraria,Clearly the story is your journey throughout the game. You make your own adventure story. It's a sandbox game.
Terraria,"""Don't expect a story""
Dude *have you studied the lore*"
Terraria,"9.9, there’s the real review buy it and don’t @ me"
Terraria,They really should do a Journeys End Review or something like that
Terraria,You sound so bored it makes me not want to play. Try some more enthusiasm for your next video!
Terraria,"Coming from 2020: i can safely confirm that terraria now has a story, known as the official lore of the game. now makes Terraria a 10/10 and this video irrelevant."
Terraria,they did'nt review this year's edition
Terraria,hahaha i can only guess how much this review would have changed these days
Terraria,Lack of story in a sandbox game huh... what about minecraft
Terraria,He keeps saying terr-au-ria.
Terraria,"I come to IGN for game reviews, I go to the comments for Review reviews"
Terraria,Now: 1.4 chaos
Terraria,Wow it’s very old (2020?)
Terraria,you sound so bored in this review
Terraria,One of IGN's best reviews. EVER! Very well-done!
Terraria,"You make your OWN story.
It’s a goddamn sandbox."
Terraria,"Well, there is a story, but it's never directly referenced in game."
Terraria,So um...when are we going to get a Re-review of this game? A LOT has changed.
Terraria,"Everyone’s complaining about how it’s *only* 9/10 because he only listed the reason lack of story, but I’m more annoyed he doesn’t seem to know what a bow is




Also 0:36 that is possibly the worst arena I have ever seen to try and fight Eye of Cthulhu in. For a start you couldn’t even hit the thing even if you actually had a ranged weapon"
Terraria,"no story? 
it's a sandbox game
someone clearly hasn't read the lore"
Terraria,"IGN, you should probably remake this lol"
Terraria,Yay terraria has an official lore now
Terraria,"I rate this review 9\10 ""no story"""
Terraria,Imagine reviewing this in 1.3 or the upcoming 1.4. Instantly 20/10
Terraria,Wow. This video is a utter piece of crap.
Terraria,"No story? They released an official story page
Draws inspiration from Minecraft? It's a 2D sandbox with an emphasis on combat and crafting, which contradicts Minecraft's focus on building.
Beheading bunnies by accident? Absolutely"
Terraria,"“No story.”
Doesn’t care about Minecraft having no story.
Terraria has lore.
Minecraft doesn’t."
Terraria,"The fact that terraria didn't have a story for me atleast made it that much more fun because it felt like my choices mattered and that  was the reason they happened rather than completing some story with required actions in order to progress the story.

Although i'm aware there are games with stories that allow you to make your own choices in a way that affects the outcome of the story."
Terraria,"it has a story, look at the game the npc they released the lore of the gmae last year"
Terraria,They should really make a new Terraria review due to all the content that has been added and because that the developers have LITERALLY RELEASED THE STORY OF THE GAME
Terraria,Terraria lacks a story and needs one
Terraria,IT CAME OUT BEFORE MINECRAFT
Terraria,"This whole review is dumb 
0/10 SMH..."
Terraria,when I saw that end screen with the numbers 9.0 I was pissed
Terraria,Hahaha if you can only see it now
Terraria,"""No story"" i beg to differ, you can find a lot of lore on the forums..."
Terraria,Why are all (99%) ign reviewers men?
Terraria,"9/10 no story,


me this person is 1/10 no taste"
Terraria,Hopefully they re review this game with a ten out of ten since lore has recently been released which if read gives you a story
Terraria,NES graphics take that back
Terraria,1:12 LOL HE JUST STOLE THE STUFF... SAVAGE
Terraria,starbound got higher... tf
Terraria,who came here because of *pewds*
Terraria,"How in hell you say 9 because it has no storie
Dude the game is ten bucks and deliver an experience better than most triple A games"
Terraria,They’ll have to redo a review after Journey’s End.
Terraria,"For me it feels like this game is too Grindy with not a rewarding enough pay off.  And the grind is basically 99% cave exploration, gets boring."
Terraria,"Honestly,  it seems you went into this with fairness.Alot of comparing to minecraft. They are actually quite similar."
Terraria,your getting reviewed by a veteran as I speak
Terraria,"Honestly, it seems like you went into this with a bias. Too much comparing it to Minecraft. They're actually quite different."
Terraria,"Overall - Terraria is a fun explorer style game, not many building to do BUT it’s so fuckin easy to make you house look cool"
Terraria,I'm gonna buy it in the next few days I feel so late
Terraria,"I think alot of people in the comments are using the term bias alittle too confident... For someone who hasn't played the game, which Beast says in the opening statement, having a frame of reference helps. And anybody saying ""it's not like a 2d minecraft"" i'm sorry but you are blind, and am missing the point of a review. All in all might buy the game based on this review, thanks."
Terraria,"I’d used to play as a kid, and I’m getting back in with friends. It’s so fun! BUT. It’s a grinding game for sure. Some ppl aren’t into that. Just to say"
Terraria,"in 2021 I was able to defeat most of the bosses with relative ease so as long as I had decent armour, good weapons, some buffs, heart statues, food, etc, but now in 2023 I'm finding to too tough defeat the bosses even with the highest hardmode armour and weapons. What happened?"
Terraria,Used to be good but haven’t played in 5 years now I don’t even know what to do😢
Terraria,2D MINECRAFT
Terraria,Terraria is always worth playing
Terraria,2D MINECRAFT??? SHUT YOUR MOUTH
Terraria,All us Terraria veterans are just happy you didn't call it 2D Minecraft.
Terraria,i wasn't into the game that much but it was fun playing with friends stilll remember that one time our base almost got overun with monsters
Terraria,You need to stop killing cute stuff!!!!
Terraria,Keep going with videos coz they are cool..just dont give up..like ever coz I hear it in your voice that you love it and understand gaming
Terraria,"I think one of the reasons I don't like minecraft that much is because I played this game a LOT, I'm talking come home from school and play until 3am."
Terraria,"Could have used a little more info especially in updates it has had and continues to have and or the modding/community info to prove the question yes/no to video better.. but otherwise decent enough video, with it being quick + simple for people that don't know of the game.
--
Big reason being ->
(It is not like these types of games and styles are no longer made even being rare niche it is, or something is majorly outdated that is pointed out, to where it would need to be asked Specifically worth This Year, and not just if it worth it in general)."
Terraria,"Honestly, it seems like you went into this with a bias. Too much comparing it to Minecraft. They're actually quite different."
Terraria,Bro terraria is bad only farm farm and farm better to get goku and hit the griddy
Terraria,"The thing is; this is not Minecraft.
Comparing is useless.
Terraria (Beta) was actually released (long) before MC, so it had also sub-zero means 'to be a MC clone' 
This game is in a league of it's own"
Inscryption,How many hours can you play this game before it gets boring ?:)
Inscryption,His voice us so fcking annoying
Inscryption,"Thank you for the clear, concise, informative Review!   I'm sold...."
Inscryption,9.9 not gonna lie
Inscryption,awesome game
Inscryption,"Experienced it on the PS5. Dog have mercy! what a uniquely great game 🤯.

Awesome job Devolver!"
Inscryption,This game is a 10 In my opinion. Never played a card game or rouge like before
Inscryption,But what about Luke Carder? Is he... a 9???
Inscryption,"Idk why, but the german Version of the game is better xD"
Inscryption,"Wow, great video!"
Inscryption,Ok not bad review but you didn’t talk about the 2nd part of the game or the 3rd part of the game
Inscryption,it took you 9 hours ? what are you some genius ?
Inscryption,It took you 9h to finish the game? Are you using a fast forward cheat in real life?
Inscryption,"The sound design is just amazing, perfection"
Inscryption,Watched some of this. It was genius till it wasn't and then it was terrible. What a punt.
Inscryption,"This game certainly takes some risks, and for the better.
Genuinely one of the best games I've played in a long time. Daniel Mullins never misses."
Inscryption,"It has a little something for everyone.
Jokes aside tho, the game is amazing, and I'm saying that from just seeing Markplier finishing it and not playing it myself."
Inscryption,"Best game, Makes you feel like a Lucky carder.
it's incredible 10/10"
Inscryption,Will it ever come to ps4?
Inscryption,"TOO FAST, TOO SOON"
Inscryption,"This review should really warn people that the game completely ditches the entire game for a whole new one about a fourth of the way through...

The second part is just painful"
Inscryption,"Top tier game easily, never a bad game in any way even if act 2 is kinda lacking"
Inscryption,did ya need to jump scare me with loud volume mic in the first seconds?
Inscryption,"Some people didn't fancy the second and third act but for me, as a fan of video game in general, it's really interesting to see how Daniel Mullins were able to integrate different kind of style and incorporate them into the story."
Inscryption,"fun fact: on the 2nd part there is a ""enemy"" that u can exploit and make a sertian card over power by sacrifising it"
Inscryption,As a note there is a mod in development that males it an infinite rouglike.
Inscryption,"Legitimately one of the best puzzle / strategy games I've ever played. Not just because of the really great card mechanics but also the dynamic flow of gameplay with story and puzzle elements is just amazing. Top that with the great, ominous theming and you have an amazing game."
Inscryption,"->skips review
->says that they gave the game a 9
->likes the video
->actually rewatches it"
Inscryption,We need console and mobile versions of this ASAP!!!!
Inscryption,This was honestly the best way to do a review of this game
Inscryption,SACRIFICE MUST BE MADE!!
Inscryption,if u had nothing bad to say about the game why not just give it a 10 lol
Inscryption,Masterpiece
Inscryption,Ouroboros: The most powerful card in the game.
Inscryption,This might very well be my absolute favorite roguelike ever. This is an amazing achievement in gaming. True innovation and creativity.
Inscryption,Will it ever come on mobile?
Inscryption,ok but the cabin was the best by far
Inscryption,call of duty vanguard is better
Inscryption,"The developer of Inscryption knew that most people bored of Cards Games, traditional or online"
Inscryption,"I'm surprise this review doesn't reveal: ""Oh hey there's also an ongoing ARG tied to the game"""
Inscryption,"0:23 The problem with the lying premise, is that you get into the game because you LIKE the premise you've been lied to ABOUT!"
Inscryption,Had a lot of fun playing this game. If you are a roguelike fan who likes plots with twists and turns this is the game for you!
Inscryption,by far the dumbest game ive ever played.
Inscryption,they actually got it right
Inscryption,You sure?
Inscryption,Will this game be one day be available on other platforms?
Inscryption,"Spoiler alert. NAZIS NAZIS NAZIS! 

IYKYK."
Inscryption,"IGN actually making a decent review? Damn, this game really brings out the best in people."
Inscryption,Thankyou for writing a spoiler free review :D
Inscryption,Just give it a 10
Inscryption,Dual disk
Inscryption,IGN: 2/10 not persona 5.
Inscryption,"all you showed was 1/3 the game, there 2 other parts to this game yo"
Inscryption,"An advice: DO NOT drop the game in the ""second part"", the game truly changes, but gets back to ""normal"" after it."
Inscryption,one of the best games I've played this decade
Inscryption,Wish this was on console. Any of the 3 consoles would do
Inscryption,A lot of people will get burned by this game because of reviews like this. What the reviewer doesn't tell you is that only about 30% of the game is actually what is seen in this review. The rest of the game looks and plays completely differently.
Inscryption,"The fact that The Cabin is only Act 1 of this game and the other Acts are nothing like the 1st is amazing, while still using the same mechanics you sre used too.

10/10"
Inscryption,"Watched Jesse Cox play the whole thing, incredible."
Inscryption,Yea one of the all time greats.
Inscryption,"The first part of this game is fun, after that it's downhill and boring. They should have just made it a rogue light with the first part"
Inscryption,9/10
Inscryption,Wow spoilers in the first couple lines Jesus 😅
Inscryption,What Warcraft could have been
Inscryption,"Just give it a 10 already, also not mentioned in the review is the amazing art design of the pixel rendered graphics and the amazing sound design"
Inscryption,This is Top 3 of the year for me. What a wild ride!
Inscryption,"Highly recommended, guys. It's great."
Inscryption,More reviews like this and less like the SMT5 one please.
Inscryption,TOOO FAST!!!!!
Inscryption,"Inscryption 10 de 10
Game of the year"
Inscryption,This game would be amazing in VR
Inscryption,Fantastic game!! Loved it
Inscryption,I’m really bad at this game and have never gotten past the trapper boss fight but this is still a great game.
Inscryption,"Finding amazing combinations was so cool, beat Act 1 with squirrels that constantly returned to my hand upon death or sacrifice."
Inscryption,Way better than pathetic CP2077
Inscryption,They Gave It 9 Out Of 10 😃
Inscryption,you should just give it 11/10 because this game is just perfect
Inscryption,An Astoundingly Bad Video Game.
Inscryption,Looks similar to thronebreaker
Inscryption,Tip: When you think the game is over...it is not
Inscryption,one of the best games！
Inscryption,"IGN,
We need more Tom Marks reviews ..."
Inscryption,Great review. Thanks for not spoiling the game!
Inscryption,Inscription is just awesome. It has an insane amount of twists and creative ideas. Even some boss fights are more creative than entire games. The amount of ways the game changes things up is astonishing.
Inscryption,"Yet another fantastic review from the IGN team. Tom Marks, Luke Reilly, Mitchell Saltzman (just to name a few) are top of their class!"
Inscryption,"The game also has a ton of replay value as well. Alternate decisions to make, new secrets to find, etc. Not to mention there was a massive ARG tied in with the game's deepest mystery. Fantastic in every field possible. Get it."
Inscryption,Ohhh it's made by the Pony Island Dev. So expect the unexpected
Inscryption,This game is revolutionary
Inscryption,"Ah, a Tom Marks review, an oasis amidst the desert of quality that is contemporary games press critique."
Inscryption,"🥧 🐎 🥛 🚗 😢 🏃‍♂️ 😫 😃 

Translate to English"
Inscryption,This was genuinely one of the best games I've ever played. If you like card games you're in for a treat honestly.
Inscryption,Bet is 8 Great!!!

Inscryption,"It's all fun until you make a triple attack, 7/7 free deathcard that pretty much one shots every enemy. Plus, immortal squirrels."
Inscryption,"The game peaks at act 1. Act 2 and 3 have this energy and mox crystal mechanic and they just suck. The story also goes into meta about creepy pasta shit and it's not scary at all. It's more like a love letter to the era of 2012-2016 where people were making stories of cursed cartridges. It's not horror, it's schlock, low grade corny fear that makes you chuckle."
Inscryption,Its ok.
Inscryption,I will say this is my favorite game. To add to it there is also a free mod called Kaycee's mod which add a whole bunch of challenges to the game like boss battles becoming totem battles etc.
Inscryption,Literally I love card deck builder games and hands down this game is the best I've ever played even against yugioh and magic to me it's great I love that some cards talk I haven't beat it yet but so far I'm loving it ❤️ 😍 ♥️
Inscryption,"Honestly this game it's quite a waste part 1 should be it all or should be improved keeping the hostage feelling you have. The lightning, the character, the cards all of it contribute to a dark despair feeling which makes the game unique in a matter of survival. The last boss of part 1 is spectacular considering you get the pawn pov. And then you get his picture and get in a dark room and... you get into another game... completely. It's like you bought a game you you've got another one... and it's not lile you got two for one or there's an extra minigame to it... it's original to change the art but it just kills so much of the immersion it just completely ruins such an amazing game, sadly"
Inscryption,"I really, really don't like reviews when they don't tell me what the game is. Previous games where everyone was saying ""Just play it don't spoil yourself"" like Undertale were really not my thing and I hated it. Was too far in to refund."
Inscryption,The act 2 just ruined the game for me... the first part is just perfect but it just stop and throw you into a game that you dont wanted in the first place...  the horror is just throwed out of the window...
Inscryption,"I actually really liked the first part but when I was already in the second part of the game I just stopped actually liking the game, it was boring and the game felt cheap also the mechanics changed which was rubbish also the third part of the game is like this too! One way I can describe this game is actually 3 different versions of one game being stitched together and only one of them actually being fun to play, so be warned, you may not actually piek the game after beating chapter 1! I learned this the hard way.."
Inscryption,"I loved this game so much, Played through twice now and I just can't get over it. It's truly something special"
Inscryption,"I don't think I like Daniel Mullins' games that much. I liked Bloop(a game jam game) a lot, and thought it was fun and creative despite being relatively repetitive, but The Hex was such a disappointment, and it seems like he's starting to repeat himself. I think he's really talented in some areas, but I just think it's time to make a new game outside of the 'Metafictional game that switches genres frequently and has a sorta retro appeal""."
Inscryption,Stoat best character.
Inscryption,"Just finished the game and absolutely loved it! A minor gripe was that you can only see the health and attack and sigils of cards in your hand when looking directly at your cards. And same with opponent cards that are behind the play area, you just cant see their stats depending on the view. Combined with the end turn bell often being covered by cards, some turns felt a little clunky. I want a view where you can see all the cards and options!"
Inscryption,"Leshy's cabin alone is worth the games price and they added two OTHER sections of about the same length, unless something comes out that completely rocks the internet for months its def GOTY imo"
Inscryption,"Possible spoilers, but you should read if you're buying solely for the previews, screenshots, etc.









Honestly? This game is a complete bait and switch and left me feeling like I got robbed.  I will say this if you are buying this game based solely on the screenshots, broadcasts, and store page don't buy it. Without explaining too much, you will be VERY disappointed. Only because it does not last and the game is actually nothing like what it advertised. I mean that quite literally. The game changes art style/graphics style (8-bit) and becomes more akin to a bright NES game than a horror game.  It's really shitty the developer preyed on people's willingness to play a rogue-lite horror card/deck builder only to completely flip the game on the buyer. I think at the most they should alter the tags of the game on steam so people MAY have SOME idea of what they're actually purchasing. I also think it's shitty the flip is hidden behind hours of gameplay just so the possibility of a refund is thrown out the window."
Inscryption,"The Undying Squirrel totem is the best one, change my mind.

Anyway, finished the cabin section and I'm absolutely floored by direction change. Exctied, but also missing the first part."
Inscryption,"you give a 9/10 but dont tell us why you are giving one point less ... i only hear you talking good about the game, the whole video. I would be interested in what would make it a 10/10 game"
Inscryption,"While the game is rather fun to play for a few hours, I can't help but sit here with a satisfied but slightly bitter taste in my mouth. I'm left with a desire for more I guess. The first part with Leshy was absolutely fabulous and produced the most enjoyment I have for this game. The second GBA part was alright, a bit of a step down but still pretty fun. However, upon going through PO3's stage and then that forced ending, and yes I mean forced, I feel like I'm either missing something or what I thought this game would be isn't at all what it actually is. Overall though, this game does scratched a long standing itch for a good card combat based game. I'll be honest I say that the whole subplot kind of went over my head, but beyond that I did have fun and I did enjoy game. However, again, I just to vent some frustrations I've gathered from playing this game.

(Slight Spoilers for anyone that cares)






I'm not a big fan of the fact that at the end of the game we get to have a small taste of what it would have been like if Grimora or Magnificus had taken control of the game. I'm especially not a big fan of the game literally forcing you to ""delete"" the game. Pardon my french, but that's just bullshit. I know its supposed to play into some kind of spooky psychological backstory, but even then this ""old_data"" nonsense seems more directed to towards people that have time to go digging through game files and connecting the red threads. But for new comers and casuals like myself, I'm just left confused and wanting more gameplay and feeling like I just got cheated out of 17 bucks for a game that feels more like 10 or 12 bucks. I mean the game even has a programed out sequence where you get to battle Grimora and Magnificus, so why the hell isn't there the option to play through the game with them in control like Leshy and PO3?! Dare I say why bother putting those parts into the ending! Whats the point? I don't think it was done cuz their lazy like EA, but come on! Don't dangle the damn carrot in my face!

I think I'd feel better if there was an option to restart the game with one of the other two Scrybes in charge so you could play through what their version of the Leshy cabin would be, and if you wanted to go and seen the super secret ending then you could choose to delete the game. I also feel like you have to have played Pony Island and/or The Hex in order to understand what kind of subplot is going on in the background, but all in all I mean yeah I had fun playing and I'll probably play this for a few more days, but after those days are up this game is going to sit in an external hard drive and spend the rest of its days collecting digital dust."
Inscryption,"I loved the portion of the game that you've covered here in the video, honestly one of the most unique fascinating card games I've played in a while, it made me realise how far a fascinating, charismatic and/or enigmatic narrator/opponent can push the game, in that way it even reminded me of Hand of Fate or Darkest Dungeon... Unfortunately beyond that my opinions changed...
Despite my following opinions I still highly recommend this game, if only for the first portion of the game.
[Beware Spoilers]










I'm going to preface this with the following, I honestly believe that the intended emotion/experience you're suppose to be left with is unfulfillment, or maybe sadness at the loss of potential, and even though this is the _point,_ it none the less made the game worse.

Part 1 was freaking amazing, by _far_ the best portion of the game, I had so much fun in just the demo that I spent hours finding little card secrets, like finding that *Long Elk* grows into *Longer Elk.* The mysteries and story hooks it presents got me so invested in the game I was itching for more after I beat Leshy's fight. What was the deal with Leshy's powerful camera? Who is the character that Luke Carde is playing as? What's the importance of the ring? Is the Stoat or the player character connected to the father from *Sacrifices Must Be Made?* And finally who, or what is Leshy, and why are we playing cards with him? So many interesting storylines... Unfortunately all of this goes straight out the cabin window when we enter Part 2, the PC is now interchangeable at the mirror, Leshy is downgraded to one of 4 ""Scrybes"" severely lessening how interesting his character is, the camera is explained away in one sentence in a cutscene (and is also just 1 of 4 similar items), and worst of all... The theme and game feel go from foreboding dark cabin to brightly saturated pokemon game. So many story hooks gone to waste, but hey, this could be interesting, lets see where this goes at least... 
The pacing is super wack at this point, in p1 the mechanics are fed one at a time to the player, usually along side a card which Leshy give a flavorful description of, helping them stick in your mind, having to choose 1 of 3 cards also helped pace it by making the player actually consider the utility of each of them. In p2 you have 2 new independent resource systems dumped on you, and you get cards in packs of 5 now, no longer are they given individual acclaim by the narrator, it's just ""here's five more cards now move on"". This coupled with the fact that you now make your own deck made me feel like I was trying to research cards for MTGA, which on it's own is fine, but it _grinds_ the pacing down to a halt. Fortunately, or unfortunately, the game is still _very_ easy, more so now that there's no death penalty, so you don't need to bother finding specific cards nor make a particularly powerful deck.

Jeez I've written quite the wall of text, so I won't touch on part 3 much here I'll just say my biggest gripe is that it is P03 is a miserable DM, he is not fun to play against, made me miss Leshy even more..."
Inscryption,"dug the review! definitely agree on it being up there as one of my favorite games of the year. to anyone reading who hasn't played yet, please avoid spoilers (for your own sake). it's well worth the experience"
Inscryption,This video review is better than reading on websites
Inscryption,"Honestly, the game would benefit massively from a multiplayer mode or an endless expansion of the actual gameplay, since there is so much untapped potential with the mechanics here."
Inscryption,Act 1 was a masterpiece. 10/10. Act 2 was honestly bad and act 3 was quite average imo. Overall I have to give it a mixed 7/10. Really a shame for me because Act 1 was some of the most entertainment I've had in a video game in my whole life and I've been playing games for 20+ years.
Inscryption,Dreaming of a PS5 port
Inscryption,After beating this game I just sat there watching 10m of credits
Inscryption,Are you the guy from Brackeys? :D Your voice sounds so familiar :)
Inscryption,I noticed that most negative reviews of this game didn't like the spoiled part. But that shows that subverting expectations can be a risky gamble.
Inscryption,"I honestly really enjoyed the game, my only gripe is hearing ""rougelike"" I was honestly hoping for more.. Rouglike. Sure it has the ismple implication of a rougelike but its not as expansive as that, I suppose that isn't the point of the game but I feel it could do a whole better with an extra ""rouge"" gamemode fleshed out with more cards and stuff not seen in the base game"
Inscryption,"Deathcards are really broken powerful. I made a card called ""Drowned Girl"". A zero cost card, with 4 attack and 4 health. I extracted the sigils from an Ant Queen with a 'get an ant worker in this hand when you play it' sigl as well as a 'return to hand when killed' sigil. So the deathcard got both. So you would play the card at zero cost, play a Worker ant sacrificing the ""Drowned Girl"". Card returns to hand. Repeat until you have 4 ants, which gain damage relative to the number of ants. That's 16 damage turn 1 if you top deck the ""Drowned Girl""."
Inscryption,all hail the mantis god!
Inscryption,"Meanwhile I went from ""This game is amazing"" until I finished act 1 then I lost interest and wonder if I'll go back."
Inscryption,"I really hope the Internet can keep it in its pants and we keep calling the Cabin ""part 1"" and that's it."
Inscryption,Ngl the ending had me shook. I felt like I messed up or something. Gonna try to see if their are alt endings or something.
Inscryption,very good review. thanks for not spoling suprises. damn. i dont like graphical style at all. but considering still buying
Inscryption,took me 12 hours to play this game but it was worth it
Inscryption,"guys, after the videos in 3:41 there is nothing to do in the dark, i think im stuck"
Inscryption,">Cub doing something specifically out of fear of something in the game

Too spoopy for me."
Inscryption,"Spoilers I guess:







I just finished the cabin part in the main game and got to the Moxes, Robots and stuff, it was pretty weird for me because I didn’t realize that there was a complete other part to the game with card collection and deck building but I’m excited for more stuff to come."
Inscryption,"Wow, what a glowing review.
I'll put this on my wishlist to get when I have a full day off with the girlfriend and kids out of the house."
Inscryption,I was numb after finishing the entire thing in a go.I feel u man.I feel u
Inscryption,"I don't like games with the small board layout. If you have a card grit, make it large enough I don't realize it even exists. Kills the atmosphere. Even in chess it is the size of the board what makes the gameplay magical."
Chained Echoes,blatant copy from octopath traveler
Chained Echoes,amazing but a bit long rev
Chained Echoes,When is New game Plus coming out?
Chained Echoes,How do I buy Chained Echoes? I can't find it on Amazon or eBay.
Chained Echoes,Just finished it yesterday. I was in tears -- what a f'king beautiful game.
Chained Echoes,"Idk. I just finished the game in about a week and... Despite how many party members you end up with, it felt like they didn't create enough characters to fulfill all the story plots they did. And the way some out of combat - combat scenes happened with people stopping others with a single hit or sneak attack just felt really dumb somehow. The weapon upgrades were annoying too because you usually find the next non shop upgraded tier out in the wild and by the time you upgrade them you've already found the next tier. The enchantments are ignorable, the attack all options were never strong enough and elemental damages rarely felt like they lined up or matched. I could go on but idk. It ate up my attention for thirty hours. That's something."
Chained Echoes,this is one of my favorite 2D RPG for the switch i love this kind of game
Chained Echoes,I bought it and didn't care for it.  Nice graphics but didn't like the battle system or characters
Chained Echoes,Definitely need to check this out now
Chained Echoes,"I feel like this is great intro for people getting into jrpgs period. It takes out so much of the antiquated mechanics that alot of jrpgs still to this day haven't fixed. Mind you I have dropped most jrpgs before finishing because of some of these mechanics. 

-no random battles(i refuse to play any jrpg with this mechanic I dont care what anybody tells me)
-no respawning mobs
-quick animations
-no intro or end of battle animations
-very minimal grinding because you don't level up in a conventional way
-game isnt overwhelmingly long

ect ect

Going forward any jrpg that I play must have atleast half of these features if not I will not play them. We are in 2023 and turned based games have and must move past all these dumb mechanics that just bog down the game. I give some more patience for older jrpgs but going forward modern jrpgs that have random battles will not get my attention. Octopath Traveler 2 refused to get rid of that garbage and I refuse to play it. I dropped the original because of it. I know im limiting myself to a small selection because of this but I just cannot get over this stuff."
Chained Echoes,totally great game but the ending had me dying
Chained Echoes,"Saw this game in an asmongold video and decided to try it based on several comments I read, I just purchased it, I’m hoping it will be a lot of fun"
Chained Echoes,"I'm so addicted, i only just started, I didn't even realise the game it's on Gamepass, I'm just at the part where you reunite with everybody and make the ""team"", I love it , maybe because it reminds me of Chrono Trigger and 100% because the game has the old school style in 16 bits"
Chained Echoes,Damn this game looks straight fire. Too bad I missed the physical release preorder.
Chained Echoes,Overdrive ruins game and it's completely unbalanced
Chained Echoes,"I am hooked from minute one, I really love the feeling of the game. Has some kind of nostalgia vibe for me. But so much deeper and better gameplay than anything else I have played."
Chained Echoes,i want to like this game but i hate every fight being a boss fight. ill try again one day...
Chained Echoes,"I wrote this comment with the help of ChatGPT, using Noisy Pixels own words that he used in this video:
 Noisy Pixels meticulously crafted speech, filled with grandiloquent words such as 'equilibrium' and 'diametrically,' only serves to detract from the actual message he is trying to convey. Rather than making an easily digestible video review, he seems more concerned with affixing an air of sophistication through the use of unnecessarily high vocabulary. This approach only serves to display a tropes aversion to the simplicity of language and a disregard for the idea that the most effective communication often relies on simple and direct language. The plethora of long, obscure words only serves to make his statements seem inconsequential in the face of the myriad of pressing issues that need our attention. HIs grandiloquence may be prepossessing at first, but quickly becomes tiresome with each iteration."
Chained Echoes,This dude is just showing off his vocabulary.
Chained Echoes,"Just downloaded it through Xbox Gamepass,if it's really good I'll buy it,looks like Chrono Trigger so I'll definitely give it a try,great review btw"
Chained Echoes,"hey could you speak any faster? 
i love a short and sweet review but this is really pushing it."
Chained Echoes,"Dude, please don't make reading your script as fast as you possibly can a priority, slow down, missed so many of your insights into the game because your words keep tumbling over the top of eachother."
Chained Echoes,but i love this game 10/10
Chained Echoes,wow i hate your reviews :)
Chained Echoes,"I was mildly looking at the new stuff out in the eShop, especially RPGs, like I do every 2 months or so. Then saw this game, which looked like one of those quite basic JRPGs which are dime-a-dozen in the eShop.
I readed some reviews, decided to give it a try and... well... let's just say that it is now within my personal Top 10 of JRPG and JRPG-inspired games.

This game is just great. Its making is filled with love and talent and you can see references of other great games and stories everywhere you look. There's Final Fantasy IX and XII, Xenogears, Chrono Trigger, Zelda... but especially Berserk. Oh boi, do I see Berserk everywhere. And I fucking love it.


Pd: Yeah. I know I copy-pasted my own comment from another video-review. But honestly, people *need* to play this game. I want its makers to receive all the money and recognition they deserve for making such a gem."
Chained Echoes,"30 hours in, and it's a classic RPG. Matthias Lynda created something special that deserves more attention. If you're a nostalgic kid from the 90s/00s, who gamed on SNES/Playstation, or just an jrpg style lover... This game is a must play. Simply incredible."
Chained Echoes,Damn how have I never heard of this??
Chained Echoes,MAN seriously take a breath in your review commentary. Your talking so fast by the end. Breathe.
Chained Echoes,Nobody wants to see a one sided payed review. Thumbs down
Chained Echoes,"Nothing wrong with setting the world itself up as the ""main character"", so to speak.  It's what FF6 and FF12 did, and those are two of my favorite games of all time."
Chained Echoes,"Heard great things about this game and luckily having Gamepass I'm  able to try it out. I knew that I was going to be my main focus over all the other games I was trying to play. I had no problem passing up on my pokemon Violet playthrough for this, seeing as how the franchise isn't the same how it used to be. Already lost interest I'm continuing with Violet. But Chained Echos so far has my undivided attention.  The music, the characters,  the dialogue is 🔥 🔥🔥🔥 And all done by 1 person???? He really needs his accolades!!!!"
Chained Echoes,"All I’ve played the last couple of years are metroidvanias, this looks like the rpg that could win me back."
Chained Echoes,"I’m only about 3 hours into the game and I’ve been having a blast. I like the dialogue, characters, and even grinding since I feel rewarded every fight with the loot that I know will be attributed to my weapons making me even stronger. Great game that if you’re looking for a new game to play this is one to check."
Chained Echoes,"The ""dark souls"" of jrpg's lol"
Chained Echoes,"I played the game for a few hours but quickly uninstalled. If I wanted to read this much, I’d have bought a book. This isn’t a video game. It’s more like an interactive book."
Chained Echoes,"I just cannot get into the nostalgia of pixel art games.  I am sure the story is good.  but pixel art game were made around 1997.  Breath of Fire 3 was easily my favorite.  but games were made like this back then because the hardware could not handle more.  It is 2023....  If you are going to make a game this good, why not make it legendary, and keep it this style, but make it look modern."
Chained Echoes,"I wanted to buy elden ring but after playing eastward I bought this, now i dont want elden ring i want more of these kind of games"
Chained Echoes,Great review. (is it me or the voice speed is a little too fast)
Chained Echoes,Glad I've downloaded this. Looks great reminds me of suikoden 1
Chained Echoes,"Wow, hype train mania over this game... I don't think Chained Echoes  is anywhere near as good as the games that inspired it..  It's a decent start, and far better than octopath (which was terrible apart from the graphics), but still, long ways away to go to be compared to the likes of Chrono Trigger, FF, Terranigma etc.. I personally enjoyed Eastward more. Eastward is also no where near as good as the classics that inspired it though. But its certainly closer than chained echoes is..."
Chained Echoes,"This game is very promising i remember xenogears, suikoden 2 and chrono trigger on this game 😁"
Chained Echoes,"This is probably the most important 2D RPG in recent years and well worth the 25 bucks. While the combat system is this games weakest argument. Why they didn't implement Combo Attacks in the form of Chrono Trigger or Phantasy Star 4 is beyond anyones comprehension, because it should have been a nobrainer...
But everything else is good. The story is surprisingly good, so good that games from the past 5-10 years cannot even compete. Its a long game, so for people who don't have time. This might be a problem. The part with the flying robots is really cool, and they allow you to traverse the world much faster and there is much to discover.

I would describe this game as Xenoblade Chronicles in 2D. Its no Chrono Trigger, not even in the slightest. But what you get for just 25 bucks is outstanding! Buy this game."
Chained Echoes,"Thanks for the review, I will be buying this for sure"
Chained Echoes,How come indie games are more interesting than most AAA games these days?
Chained Echoes,"Progress-locked behind story points, can not level.  Hard pass."
Chained Echoes,"this game suffers from some of the worst balancing issues some bosses are piss easy and some minor enemies can hit you for everything early on, unless you turn down the damage in the setting which is pathetic and MY GOD it takes so long to finally get your sky armor which was the selling point to this game how disappointing that you have to slog through hours of boring backtracking before you get it, listen there are way too many games out there for indie devs to be making tedious games. game needs a patch for balance that's all the negatives, positives? its a beautiful looking throw back game with an amazing concept and story with mature themes and rob is my fave"
Chained Echoes,i just finished the game and it was a banger !
Chained Echoes,This is the game Pier Solar should had been if it wasn't too rely on the old Sega Genesis hardware. Pier Solar was a Sega Genesis game first and then ported to modern systems thus the game feels very sluggish and unsatisfactory whereas this game is a homage to the 16-Bit era but took advantage of every modern features it could implement into the game making it a smoother and satisfactory experience.
Chained Echoes,"+1 on the part where I cannot reread things, I have no interest to read at the beginning of the game (a lot text throw at my face and I get overwhelmed, then find out there is no way to get them back.)

and so, I've refunded the game."
Chained Echoes,This is a great review
Chained Echoes,It's feels like a mobile phone game. i pass
Chained Echoes,Holy moly this all sounds fantastic. I need to finish my backlog and get onto this one before Se of Stars also comes out.
Chained Echoes,This game is so cool but why does almost everyone have red hair 😂
Chained Echoes,More fun than ragnock gow
Chained Echoes,9.5? Whoa! Hearing nothing but good things about this one. Both great & sad that it's an overall better made RPG than games like Star Ocean: The Divine Force and Pokémon: Scarlet & Violet.
Chained Echoes,This and Sea of Stars will spawn a whole lot of indie pixelart RPGs and I'm all for it.
Chained Echoes,"This game should have been nominated for game of the year! Is it still eligible for 2023? Cuz if it is, this game has a head start for Best RPG and GOTY for 2023."
Chained Echoes,Subbed !
Chained Echoes,coolspritesgagement
Chained Echoes,How does this game compare to Triangle Strategy? :D
Chained Echoes,I loved Octopath Traveler and am very excited that this just touched down on game pass.
Chained Echoes,Man your reviews are really good. Loving chained echoes so far. I am hooked after 7 hours
Chained Echoes,An absolute gem of a game. It's so damn good that I'm about to buy it on Switch on top of Steam and will start a savefile over just to be able to play it on the go. It's that good.
Chained Echoes,Personally I really don’t care for the art style. I love SNES graphics but this just looks bland and uninteresting. Everything else about the game sounds great though. I may end up waiting for a sale.
Chained Echoes,Succinct and informative. Subscribed!
Chained Echoes,"Who tf care about noisy pixels opinion? Just go buy it and play the hell out of it, its great."
Chained Echoes,Turn based just drag now days. Also the sound effects really duck in this game - turn the music down and there's hardly any game sound
Chained Echoes,8 Hours into the game and I can't stop playing. It truly is a masterpiece of a turn-based RPG. Beautiful environments and just fun all around. Definitely recommend.
Chained Echoes,Easily the best jrpg I have played since lost odyssey
Chained Echoes,"So those crystals to strengthen yourself are only from bosses and quests? If I heard right. Doesn't seem this game is for me, if I can't grind levels I'll lose interest. Oh well."
Chained Echoes,"Great review, very in depth."
Chained Echoes,"I discovered this game like 2 days before it came out, and immediately was floored by the previews. I'm a fair number of hours into it and I'm shocked by how good this is, it's like a Cross Code/Chrono trigger hybrid with ironically the Chrono Cross progression system of bosses giving you a ""level up."" And the early optional boss I found was hilarious and actually tough, it's such a good game."
Chained Echoes,"Thanks, great review, I'll give it a go :)"
Chained Echoes,Did the reviewer’s script include any commas or full stops?
Chained Echoes,This game feels A LOT like CrossCode with a medieval skin.
Chained Echoes,Its on Gamepass
Chained Echoes,playign dq11 on switch beat pokemon vileot it was ehhh  im excited for this afrter
Chained Echoes,"I like it when you do longer reviews, good job!"
Chained Echoes,waiting for physical edition first
Chained Echoes,"Saw this on gamepass, tried it out and I'm pretty hooked"
Chained Echoes,...isn't the lore just the eberron lore from DND???
Chained Echoes,"For those who have Gamepass on pc, its on there."
Chained Echoes,Indie garbage....very similar to this amateur channel.
Chained Echoes,Please please..Keep your reviews 7 mins and ynder. keep them short
Chained Echoes,Great review but you read it like you were in a hurry
Chained Echoes,"Got it downloaded and I'm ready to dive in. Between this, midnight suns and eastward I'm a busy busy dude"
Chained Echoes,"Can't wait to play it! Ara Fell and Rise of the Third Power have shown me that amazing turn-based 2D games are still being made, and I'm sure this one will only strengthen that belief"
Chained Echoes,Game still isn’t out on the German Switch store..weird considering it’s from a German dev and publisher. I wanna buy!!!
Chained Echoes,Xbox giving this with game pass that's awesome.
Chained Echoes,"this is on game pass, THIS IS ON GAME PASS. if you like any of those call backs this game has THIS IS ON GAME PASS. play this game"
Chained Echoes,A 9.5 score speaks volumes if it's coming from you. Will definitely check out
Chained Echoes,Bless you sweet sweet gamepass.
Chained Echoes,"Have been mostly disappointed with a lot of indie games, but this seems great. How long is the whole game and how's the difficulty?"
Chained Echoes,"When I see an rpg that's a little like a Legend of Mana game, then I realise it's turn based combat.... a little bit of my soul dies"
Chained Echoes,"are characters locked into using specific weapon types, or can we mix-and-match?"
Chained Echoes,This game looks great but woww no one knows this even exists
Chained Echoes,"9.5/10, glad to hear you liked it as I already preordered it. I’m so glad retro 16 bit style turn based rpgs are making a comeback."
Chained Echoes,Does the game have voice acting or is it all reading
Chained Echoes,Im guessing there’s no replay value
Chained Echoes,I think you talk too quickly in this review….
Chained Echoes,"Hey SwitchUp Family - What do you make of this one? Unfortunately, I lost a huge amount of footage, so i have done my best to still make an interesting video, I hope it’s ok! Mark"
Chained Echoes,"Tried this game last night and I couldn't put it down, so good"
Chained Echoes,"the sprite work is simply beautiful, this it the type of game that even I can appreciate ( not a big jrpg/turn based fan ) Yet i find myself drawn towards this charming looking game! thanks for a great video bruv :)"
Chained Echoes,Overrated piece of turd.
Chained Echoes,"Daaaammmm switch friggin SUUUUCKS.  I got one for metroid, but havent fuqt with it for anything else....

🫡"
Chained Echoes,This game has the quality of 32 bit PS1 style 2D sprites on an HD overlay. It is simply beautiful and reminds me of SNES Final Fantasy gameplay wise. What an amazing game so far. We need more like this
Chained Echoes,"What's that at 1:42 you said? multiple characters, multiple group and split story? nope.. nope.. nope.. I'm out"
Chained Echoes,Remind me of breath of fire and lunar
Chained Echoes,"I'm gonna get this but yes I agree about main character designs, generic as hell and boring, even the faces I don't like, also there's something about the whole artstyle even tho is beautiful enough, color palette is great."
Chained Echoes,"After playing the game, the storyline reminds me of the anime, fantastic children, which is still underrated till this day. 

Spoiler:




Characters are reincarnation of their past lives, fmc main interest is not the mc, sadly 😞"
Chained Echoes,"I honestly think the game is great but it's super lacking in polish. By no means is it some incredible masterpiece like people are saying. Here are some of the glaring issues...

-A fair bit of typos and incorrect instructions on buttons and various other systems.
-the lack of different emotions or moving mouth animations while characters are talking just comes off as lazy and really takes away from moments that are supposed to be powerful.
-while some of the sprite work is great, other parts are awful, like moving water.
-character portraits can be super bizarre and/or awkward looking (I'm talking about you purple haired knight lady with your weird lip).
-moments that would have been really cool to see are just skipped and instead explained by characters. Show, don't tell. A great example of this is the first flight of the massive ship, the Aurora.
-some of the dialog is atrociously bad and seems out of place or awkward. Ei. The princess calling her brother ""a huge pile of shit."" Nobody talks like that.
-some of the rpg systems just seem unnecessary, like socketed weapons.
Sometimes less is more.

I think the game does a lot right though! The combat and some of the rpg systems are super convenient and interesting, also fun and engaging. Rewards for exploration and achievements is engaging. The plot keeps along at a great pace and the characters, Robb aside, are all likeable and interesting.

I hope the developer cleans the game up a bit and does a better version down the road. Seeing how good the game is now, I honestly think they could have done better."
Chained Echoes,"I just searched ""chained echoes"" and searched for most views. Guess which video was at the top :D. Switchup is coming up!"
Chained Echoes,Just finished Chained Echoes. Amazing game and well worth anyone's time. If you like turn based RPGs... This is an extra special treat.
Chained Echoes,"When we got p5 and dq11 I felt like perfect modern triple-a jrpgs had been achieved. With chained echoes and the forthcoming sea of stars, the same feed true for indie equivalents."
Chained Echoes,"This is not a game that should be overlooked. It basically is a loved child from FFVI, Xenogears, and Chrono Trigger combined. Everything about it enjoyable. I have no complaints. Gorgeous pixel art to the point it may be some of the best ever. Fantastic soundtrack. Very likeable characters. Good villains. Solid story. Fun combat tho you may want to tweak the difficulty settings to balance them the way you like. I found normal for enemy stats mad the regular field enemies take way too long to beat so I got low stats normal aggression and that works out well for those of us who don;t need games to be the hardest they can possibly be. lol Btw, I prefer this style of difficulty settings to the regular easy, normal, hard setup. I'd rather just scale certain things up or down. This is something AAA games should consider. This is a 10/10 game for me and I never give out 10s on a personal level. I always at least find something that annoys but this game is just a wonderful love letter to old school JRPGs. I think it would have stood toe to toe vs FFVI or Chrono Trigger if it came out during the same era honestly."
Chained Echoes,Game way too much difficult !! I have unlocked everything and many MANY things but still get beaten by normal monsters at canyon..... Or is it a bug ??? I've heard there's some several bugs.... I have leveled up so far all my weapons and characters and still get 2 shotted by monsters lol I don't understand how this game works or it is actually a bug on my stats ??? Not gonna say that this is the perfect game like everyone seems to say. Indeed the story is good and the gameplay too but WAY WAY too difficult. Difficult to learn mechanics and very difficult to kill simple monsters.... I'd say 11/20 on my final note on this game due to the difficulty.
Chained Echoes,looks awesome. that turn order is a bit in the way haha.
Chained Echoes,How's the writing? I would like a JRPG that doesn't have that dumb exposition typical of japanese games when they mention the same thing 50 times. Does it have that?
Chained Echoes,"All I heard was ""Xenogears"" and everything went fuzzy after that. 🤤🤤🤤"
Chained Echoes,"Playing this on GamePass, but seriously considering buying the switch version just to support the dev!"
Chained Echoes,An awesome game! I love it!
Chained Echoes,Just ordered the physical version. Unfortunately it won't arrive until late 2023 but I'm a patient man.
Chained Echoes,"Good game, but I liked Radiant Historia better"
Chained Echoes,All this and its not even 1gb wow! Imagine if they used more space. Now this is a full game that is deserving and worthy of dlc and or updates! Buying full price to support the dev 100%!
Chained Echoes,"What a dated game, its only purpose is to please Nostalgia Fanboys"
Chained Echoes,"Definitely getting this after I'll finally finish Hollow Knight, looks great!"
Chained Echoes,Minor gripe that which a few more memebers like  an editor would have maid the game a 10
Chained Echoes,I think it's more inspired by suikoden 2 rather than chrono trigger & ffvi
Chained Echoes,Why are the graphics sooooo shit ?
Chained Echoes,"The fact that a solo developer made a game that absolutely destroys 
Most triple a jrpg games 
Is amazing"
Chained Echoes,"Having actually gotten Chained Echoes - I have to admit, I was having so much fun up until the mechs. I don't mind the Sky Armours in combat but the mechs on the maps just feel a little off and not to my taste but they're a required mechanic for exploration. Just found myself not playing the game as much since I received the Sky Armours."
Chained Echoes,There is a physical version?
Chained Echoes,3 hrs is 3 hrs too long for a boss fight
Chained Echoes,the art is a crime
Chained Echoes,"i still didnt get much about the depth of combat 
is it really complex and strategic ?"
Chained Echoes,"Buying simply because a single person poured so much time and love into this nostalgic game. I loved these games the most growing up, know I’ll love the trip Echoes will take me on."
Chained Echoes,"This game was such an unbelievable gem I love it so much 
The team put so much love into this"
Chained Echoes,"This is one of those titles that could be compared to the greats. Fact is for me, this IS one of the greats and stands tall amongst them. Absolute classic! Nice review. Thoroughly enjoying it, can't put it down."
Chained Echoes,I need the physical of this preferrably limited edition.
Chained Echoes,This game is very promising goty candidate for 2023 😁
Chained Echoes,I am curious and would like to ask what accessibility options does this game offer players who are completely blind or who are visually impaired?
Chained Echoes,"Purchased immediately after seeing it was your game of the year Mark, looking forward to getting stuck into this tonight!"
Chained Echoes,"This game is fabulous, i really enjoyed it."
Chained Echoes,The fact that I bought this on Steam for play on SteamDeck instead of Switch tells me my switch days are over.
Chained Echoes,please support this project! he invested a lot of work and love to it! a love letter to 2D JRPGs
Chained Echoes,"Great game, now included with Game pass on Xbox"
Chained Echoes,Are there any side quests in this game? I'm 10 hours in and have never had a single side quest.
Chained Echoes,"Progress-locked behind story points, can not level.  Hard pass."
Chained Echoes,"Never heard of this game but after your best games of the year and now this video, I'm going to be on the look out."
Chained Echoes,"0:58 ""Goddamn"" colour palette? Lol"
Chained Echoes,Nintendo remember when you used to make games with a quality like these
Chained Echoes,12 hours into the game. Loving every bit of it ! It’s been so long since i got JRPG to my liking
Chained Echoes,This and crosscode are what love and passion can create.
Chained Echoes,"Good gameplay and writing isn't enough to make up for bland as hell art design.  This game looks really ugly and dull compared to the games it's emulating.  The most important part of an rpg is having cool looking characters that I get to play as like Cloud, Dart, Crono etc.  If I don't think the characters and the setting are cool then it's a hard pass."
Chained Echoes,Don't be comparing it to the almighty CT! Good video though!
Chained Echoes,I care a lot about replay value. What's the replay value of this game?
Chained Echoes,"One game I like watching people play, but could never play myself seeing I suck at turn based games lol. Great job once again"
Chained Echoes,Watched this twice. Buying it in the morning!  Thank you for the great reviews!
Chained Echoes,"Looks like crosscode, great game"
Chained Echoes,I don't even like JRPGs and I like this one
Chained Echoes,"I'm surprised golden sun didn't get a mention in the ""inspired by"" comments"
Chained Echoes,"I was surprised you didn’t cover the mech combat more, but great review overall! I appreciated the Xenogears call-out, as it’s one of my favorite classic JRPGs, and it’s criminally overlooked. I’m so glad people are out there making games like this still. I’ll definitely be picking this up!"
Chained Echoes,"waiting for the physical releasse.. man all the reviews about this game are intense.. this is such a labor of love from a sole person who developed this game for 7 years.. hope he continues his  burning  passion.. what a guy.. been an jrpg fan since time and memeorial and this game is a must, money well spend and i coudnt ask for more 😊"
Chained Echoes,Thanks for the recommend .. Saw it on my Gamepass feed and needed to learn more.. Excited to play later
Chained Echoes,As I'm currently playing through this now I deff got Xenogears vibes & I friggan loved that game. Actually still have the game intact with the jewel case as well as the video game guide
Chained Echoes,"Video is great Mark! I've wishlisted this. I have too many games right now but I will definitely check this out. I love underdog stories/solo devs. Forager comes to mind, which I've purchased on three platforms!"
Chained Echoes,I don’t have a switch anymore but i found you when I had my switch and I’m on a ps5 now so thank you for this review. I just bought this on ps5 👏
Chained Echoes,"Wow - big words in the intro(for the game). Drew me in, and earned a sub. Good vid, good channel!!"
Chained Echoes,Demo blew me away
Chained Echoes,how do i play this on steamdeck lol
Chained Echoes,"does chained echoes publisher, deck13, made evoland too?"
Chained Echoes,Damn. Regretting some recent spending of mine. I’ll definitely pick this up eventually though. Looks incredible
Chained Echoes,"Really weird and outdated to still score individual technical and artistic aspects and then linearly summing them up.
Not disagreeing with the scores but I think most review outlets have correctly left this kind of rating scheme behind.
A game is more than the sum of its parts (sometimes less)"
Chained Echoes,"They know what they're doing by putting Glenn, who happens to look very much like Adol Christin, in the middle of the cover art."
Chained Echoes,"Amazing review, thank you."
Chained Echoes,"Looks right up my alley, just ordered the physical version.
Also, I'm glad those sprites aren't animated at 7:53. I hate how overanimated and bouncy these 2D indie games can get. The battle bouncing is a good example but at least it makes some sense there."
Chained Echoes,warning light spoilers...
Chained Echoes,This game is super dope!!!
Chained Echoes,the idle motions probably was far beyond what he could get done
Chained Echoes,This game is absolutely amazing. A one man team makes a better JRPG than anything the mighty juggernaut square enix has produced in over a decade
Chained Echoes,"I'm playing this right now.

So far the battle mechanics are quite fun, altough the difficult of the game is on the casual side.
The technical stuff live graphics and music are good too.
Editing: 
I was forgeting to tell about the level up system, I liked it! The game doesnt require grind.
Another thing that I liked is how easy is to indentify a item on the screen and the cut scene buttom.

The huge dowside of the game is the story telling.
Things like lore, characters, the background world and so on are very boring and outdated.

The characters are something else, they are very forgettable and have zero charisma.

But theres a skip cut scene buttom that saves the game, without it I would had dropped it on the first hours."
Chained Echoes,A 3hr bossfight is proper. I want my moneys worth and not pay to win. Heroic triumphs make heros. Mediocre ones make bards :p
Chained Echoes,"The game looked amazing, but its so....linear."
Chained Echoes,"Well hot damn, that sounds incredible. Now I just have to decide between the Switch and Steam (/Steam Deck) versions."
Chained Echoes,For me its the game of the year!
Chained Echoes,i have played for 10h and this game is amazing
Chained Echoes,"Finally, some jrpg that isn't a rehash of already 10x released title, or just another squenix attempt at cashgrab."
Chained Echoes,"Wow this looks incredible. Even the visual humor in fighting skewered vegetables make me laugh just watching this 😂
I can't wait to try it!"
Chained Echoes,I saw the word chrono and got hype but now imsad there will be no chrono anything
Chained Echoes,"""Xenogears but with some strong adult writing""

....uh.... did you play Xenogears my guy?"
Chained Echoes,"This looks amazing and I'm definitely gonna check it out. I do want to point out that you said in your review that it could use some facial animations etc. I agree but from what I've seen I'd also be happy with at least one black character! I hate bringing this point up but as I watched this I noticed all those really neat looking designs, also other species etc. But come on with all that variaty color shouldn't be that hard to include.. I hope I just missed it but it doesn't look like it.."
Chained Echoes,No grinding??? Sign me in!
Chained Echoes,I bought this game while watching the trailer
Chained Echoes,Meh
Chained Echoes,Love your guys reviews some of the best around! glad the games great I can't wait to play it after Crisis core!
Chained Echoes,"this game is disgustingly pozzed and the writing is absolute horseshit
to anyone reading this, avoid at all costs"
Chained Echoes,Feels like it also has some Golden Sun in it! Love it
Chained Echoes,"As soon as I saw them turn into badass looking Power Rangers I was double sold. I was already sold just on the intro! All I played on the SNES were Mario RPG, Lion King and any game that looked like this. Aaaaasaaaaaand purchased!"
Chained Echoes,"Holy smokes first ai heard of this. On ps4 as well, and on sale on steam. Will picj this up tonight, thanks!"
Chained Echoes,I didn't even hear about this game until the day it released and I'm absolutely loving it so far. And one of the bosses took you 3 hours?! Now I'm a little scared for when I get to that one 💀
Subnautica,How do you use audio and not get copyrighted?
Subnautica,This game is the only game that made me physically sweat when going into the abyss exploring
Subnautica,James Cameron would probably love this
Subnautica,yeah ill never forget going on to the other side of the aurora for people that havent played the game dont
Subnautica,Definitely my favorite game of all time.
Subnautica,"The moment when you build your first cyclone, board it and it welcomes you as the captain.... O M G!!!"
Subnautica,"I’ve never heard anyone ever say 
aqu-attic."
Subnautica,"You should have atleast mentionned bugs in this game, Unpleasant ones"
Subnautica,Solid narrate lods
Subnautica,Subnautica is a great ocean exploration game but No mans sky is massive!!! Exploration game. So much more exploration in no mans sky then subnautica. But both are best exploration games ever created.
Subnautica,Perfection.
Subnautica,"Totes trigged by pronunciation of ""aquatic""... need a brandy and a lie down."
Subnautica,求求你们开发第三部吧！！！😭😭😭😭
Subnautica,"1:58 “but the oceans apex predators are practically unkillable.” 

Me with the stasis rifle and knife: “Are you sure about that?”"
Subnautica,Does using an SSD help with the drawing distances? Both on PC and on PS4.
Subnautica,Best survival game ever!
Subnautica,"Just finished reading a few of H.P Lovecraft's books, and now I'm gonna play this"
Subnautica,Incredible experience
Subnautica,"""surprises"" sure is a tame way of describing nightmare fuel"
Subnautica,Bobo
Subnautica,This game gave me high blood pressure 🩸
Subnautica,warning entering ecological dead zone adding report to databank
Subnautica,A bit of more optimization would have done the game and US a big big favor.
Subnautica,I’ll never understand the appeal of horror. Why would you WANT to be scared? 😂
Subnautica,A🦆tic
Subnautica,This guy is pronouncing “aquatic” the way he does is giving me diarrhea
Subnautica,You forgot about the glitches with saves and getting sent across the map when loading back into ur game
Subnautica,Iquaadick
Subnautica,Best game I’ve ever played
Subnautica,SUB
Subnautica,Probably the best survival game on the market. Playing in VR is ridiculously immersive.
Subnautica,Just Got My Platinum Trophy of this Master Piece🔥
Subnautica,this gameplay makes me want to rub it off
Subnautica,"""Forbidding, Ridley Scott-esque""...not ""foreboding""...different meanings.
But you do make me want to play this!"
Subnautica,"don't review multiplatform games on pc, ign. shittiest platform to review games on."
Subnautica,This game is so much fun!
Subnautica,10
Subnautica,"Every part of this game is great, except the pop in. That part is pretty subpar"
Subnautica,Subnautica my favorite survival game.
Subnautica,I’m getting this
Subnautica,For once an understandable review from ign
Subnautica,Further and deeper😏
Subnautica,"Who’s here, after watching the Subnatica Below Zero review?"
Subnautica,Pov;you wanna be a marine biology
Subnautica,YOU FORGOT ABOUT THE KEEP CALM KITTY POSTER WHICH MAKES IT A 9.5 EASY.
Subnautica,Amazing how IGN think a five minute video is enough to competently review a game
Subnautica,"It's a great review if you've already played the game, but it spoils loads of environments and all the vehicles."
Subnautica,This game is an easy 10 so much fun
Subnautica,T.j. Leviathans are in possible to kill jacksepticeye kills all
Subnautica,This game lacks content.  Needs an update.
Subnautica,This game looks interesting but feels like it could have used another couple months of development to really smooth out the animations and gameplay. It looks like a pre-alpha build.
Subnautica,Whats is the difference with the new release?
Subnautica,This game and The Forest are why Indie Devs need to receive the utmost praise and support. And the honorable mention Stranded Deep as well. Keep it the amazing work guys!
Subnautica,uhqwatik
Subnautica,"I’m looking for a Godzilla style monster game, will this scratch that itch?"
Subnautica,So basically No Mans Sky but underwater?
Subnautica,Is it just me or does he say aquatic weird 😂😂
Subnautica,👍🏼
Subnautica,Just finished it
Subnautica,"Its a shame it has alot of graphical glitches especially pop up ect. When everything works, its a great game full of wow-moments though and should be played by everyone who wants something different"
Subnautica,Just started playing it today. :)
Subnautica,Omg 3 years old how
Subnautica,I'm getting a strong Made in Abyss vibe here
Subnautica,I'm here because of this free game from Sony...hehe

Subnautica,Uh-kwah-tic 👌
Subnautica,The Game Doesn't Look interesting And Fun
Subnautica,Need on Switch
Subnautica,Love this ❤❤
Subnautica,play through subnautica below zero
Subnautica,Playing abandon ship at the end was such a power move!
Subnautica,I just saw the Reaper leviathan map and there's a lot of those arround the Aurora but i never ran into any of them the first time i ever went there
Subnautica,There's a sequel you know.
Subnautica,Thank you eclipse for this review
Subnautica,Subnautica below zero when
Subnautica,You have totally got to play the sequel “BELLOW ZERO” its in my opinion not as good as the first one but still is an insane game. Not to mention they made the game way harder and i think that you would totally enjoy that part lol
Subnautica,You are legit the reason I bought it on steam loved the series I'm  gonna try to make a series of my own. Have a great day
Subnautica,a game i would love to see eclipse play would be terraria its like minecraft but 2d and has a lot more to do
Subnautica,why did i not get a notification to the end of this series
Subnautica,If you liked the first one you should play below zero. Wouldnt say its as good as the first one but its still a bit different in its own way. Also fun way to waste time
Subnautica,I'm so used to seeing him complain about jojo games and roblox (which everything that comes out of his mouth is true...most of the time) that seeing hum happy and playing a game gives some odd satisfaction
Subnautica,"I never made the stasis rifle & never tried to kill the fauna in my playthrough that I just finished up. I didn’t really feel like that was the point in the game so I specifically tried to avoid killing the creatures. (Except the lava larva, screw those guys) I feel like I didn’t have most of your negatives due to that playstyle & after hearing your review I’m even happier that I played the game how I did, plus it felt like it also lined up with where the story went. I did figure out the circling the leviathan but it made sense to me due to their massive size vs the player or seamoth’s nimble nature in comparison. However because I wasn’t engaging with leviathan on purpose most of my interactions were geared towards escape rather than anything that would call for the circling."
Subnautica,this shit reminds me Avatar 2 af 💀
Subnautica,There is a second subnatica fyi if you ever want to play it
Subnautica,i don’t watch you very often anymore but i will say i love your game reviews :))
Subnautica,you should play yba
Subnautica,Eclipse leviathans arent meant to kill you they are meant to make u on edge and btw it’s your confidence they give u a chance to run and they are always there for you to fight its your confidence won’t let u kill them ad your too scared
Subnautica,When subnautica below zero
Subnautica,"Hey eclipse, are you planning on making a subnautica below zero let’s play? I really enjoyed the series and hope you continue."
Subnautica,please play the sequel
Subnautica,Okay when you are going to do subnautica below zero gameplays?
Subnautica,Sub zerooo
Subnautica,😎👍
Subnautica,try subzero
Subnautica,SEQUEL!
Subnautica,Thalassophobia:
Subnautica,You’d probably enjoy Rain World. frustrating rogue-like but the AI is some of the best I’ve ever seen in a game.
Subnautica,nice review thanks for being honest
Subnautica,"Its amazing that the video got another 14k after the stream, where for a little bit you talked about how few views it got! Its good to see that it got a lot more"
Subnautica,will you play subnatuica subzero or whatever its called?
Subnautica,Now play below zero
Subnautica,I agree with all his points EXCEPT the reaper leviathan shouldn't be everywhere.
Subnautica,"Can someone 
Tell me what does the account age have to be to join the discord"
Subnautica,"Subnautica: Below Zero, everybody wants you to play it, including me, please, we need more subnautica!"
Subnautica,Why was this recommended so late lol
Subnautica,"I absolutley loved this series, it was one of the best things i consumed on this channel, if theres a chance id really hope you redirect your channel  for the better since right now you are stuck with roblox and jojo. (Also if you ever try Subnautica SubZero it would be awesome for you to try it on your channel)"
Subnautica,Im still waiting for eclipse to max everything. And still hoping eclipse upgrades his knoife so he does not have to stab a leviathan for a whole month
Subnautica,"I have easily replayed this game like 5 times.
Each time as terrifying as the last which is amazing"
Subnautica,Eclipse kinda looks like mclovin to me idk why
Subnautica,THAT SOUNDTRACK 😩😩😎😎
Subnautica,So. Whats next my lord?
Subnautica,Foolish i played THE ENTIRE GAME ALMOST 1 YEAR AGO
Subnautica,This is good. Youtube recommend this
Subnautica,Deepwoken?
Subnautica,Make sabnautica below zero
Subnautica,can you post the blox fruits vid u talked about on stream cause than it could shine light to the devs on how bad the grind is
Subnautica,I came here just to like the video not funna watch but ima like it just for you mat
Subnautica,"the fact that i had to specifically search for this video in particular, video name word for word and it was the third result. youtube hates you"
Subnautica,Day 2 of asking eclipse to play deepwoken
Subnautica,They should add an upgrade to the prawn suit which allows you to grab the front claws of the reaper and rip them off.
Subnautica,YouTube did not recommend me this so annoying
Subnautica,I didn't get the notification for this video weird
Subnautica,Hey eclipse would you be kind enough to play ark survival evolved? It’s almost like subnautic and it’s fun(stress inducing)!
Subnautica,"Subnautica
 below zero?"
Subnautica,Over All nice Game Review ! ☕️
Subnautica,"Some leviathan issues are fixed in the sequel,when I finished it is still think the 1st game has a better story"
Subnautica,"LITTLE DID HE KNOW, THERES ANOTHER GAME OUT AND HE NEEDS TO PLAY IT"
Subnautica,"1:14 what is that song, i need it
thanks"
Subnautica,"Now you gotta play the Forest, watching you play horror games is funni asf"
Subnautica,We
Subnautica,"MOOOREEEE
I WANT MORE SUBNAUTICAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
Subnautica,Alright eclipse time for subnautica below zero
Subnautica,😳
Subnautica,I enjoyed the Subnautica playthrough
Subnautica,7k views god damn 💀
Subnautica,I really hope you'll eventually play Subnautica Below Zero. I couldn't stop smiling through the entire series.
Subnautica,"comment for algorhythm, ignore"
Subnautica,I think eclipse has a problem with the leviathans
Subnautica,Well sadly subnautica is just getting bug fixes so no new things in it
Subnautica,Youtube didn’t even send me the fucking notification
Subnautica,You started this game 7 MONTHS AGO?
Subnautica,and now subnautica below zero
Subnautica,"Too bad I can’t afford it.
Great series though!"
Subnautica,"It's nice to see eclipse  writing a positive review about a game for a change, he usually craps on games. Well to be fair no one can blame eclipse for usually crapping on games as he primarily plays roblox and well, need i say more???"
Subnautica,Omg this video actually got recommended to me
Subnautica,You should continue doing this
Subnautica,Me wondering if eclipse is going to play Subnautica: below zero
Subnautica,Its just that you built your audience around roblox so your views are far behind when you're doing something else
Subnautica,17:52 also the screenshots are there because you can actully find time capsules around the world from random players
Subnautica,14:43 also i dont think this could be blammed at subnautica because im pretty sure thats something with the engine of old games like how minecraft java edittion has the same issue but the newer bedrock edittion with the better engine compleatly fixed the rendering issue i think this is the same case with subnautica and subnautica below zero
Subnautica,12:51 in there defense they are kinda busy working on below zero
Subnautica,10:13 im pretty sure the reason all of them exist is just to keep a wall around the edge of the map and the aurora because subnautica doesnt rlly want u to know that the right side of the aurora is kinda bugged and broken with some weird invisible walls and rendering issues because they didnt expect you to actully go there and the other reapers are spreaded around the edge of the map to keep you from accidently going over the edge and gettin mauled to death by like 3 ghost luviathens
Subnautica,have you tried playing elden ring
Subnautica,(Signal boosting comment)
Subnautica,will u play below zero?
Subnautica,God I wish I could experience this game for the first time again
Subnautica,Hey about the time capsule you don't need to actually do anything with it
Subnautica,I agree about the leviathans. My solution about the phasing through walls be to give them colliders and a decently larger hit box. I also kinda wish the game would reward you with some sort of item or blueprint for killing a leviathan.
Subnautica,"you should try elden ring, it's also an awsome souls game with a very cool world"
Subnautica,How tho
Subnautica,You should try it with mods sometime
Subnautica,Play subnautica below zero
Subnautica,bro PLEASE play hollow knight it has an amazing story and art the gameplay and bosses are also REALLY good
Subnautica,"Now i want Eclipse play other video games and give it Reviews, honestly I recommend playing Terraria"
Subnautica,Eclipse was literally me playing subnautica the first time other than the part of stabbing every thing he sees but the game was fun for me
Subnautica,"Now that we are done with subnautica, will we get a subnautica below zero playthrough?"
Subnautica,No you shouldn't play subnautica unless you got some fish fetish
Subnautica,this game has been one of my favourites ever since early access
Katana Zero,The the story was actually heart wrenching to me 😭
Katana Zero,FIRE THIS REVIEWER
Katana Zero,literally a 10/10
Katana Zero,Its like Hotline Miami mixed with My Friend Pedro.
Katana Zero,ign is the worst company to ever exist
Katana Zero,amazing game  :)
Katana Zero,Is this game like an old boy reference?
Katana Zero,"wym doesnt quite hit, katana zero is one of the only games ive played where the story felt as important as the gameplay in my mind, It felt so amazing to hear everything and kind of figuire it out by myself."
Katana Zero,"""The story doesnt quite hit the high note""
Your deffinetly high on chronos and you skip the dialogues on purpose"
Katana Zero,"""Dialogue options gave little deviation""
What 😂 
The goal of the prison level literally changes with certain dialogue options
What about the damn Omega Flowey secret boss"
Katana Zero,bro seeing this after playing hours of katana zero with 0% hitpause makes me feel sick
Katana Zero,hire me as an ign reviewer ffs ill do the best job
Katana Zero,"8.7? Lol, you guys need a better reviewers"
Katana Zero,"ending had me in tears man, it HITS"
Katana Zero,“The story doesn’t quite hit” did he play the game
Katana Zero,What? The story doesn’t hit? Are you crazy.
Katana Zero,This game is like ghostrunner but 2d and pixelated
Katana Zero,Solid 10/10
Katana Zero,Turned the screen shake off and never looked back.
Katana Zero,10
Katana Zero,This is one of the sickest games I've ever played.
Katana Zero,"""Taking more than a _few_ cues from Hotline Miami""

So, like, a few colors? Pixels? General violence? Being a videogame? I'm not at all sure how comparisons between the two AREN'T a confusing stretch. It feels like needlessly desperate ""journalism"""
Katana Zero,"""It never runs out of ideas...."" (shows cart level)"
Katana Zero,It’s the kind of games that is challenging but not fun
Katana Zero,"""story didn't hit"" ""Nameless samurai."" Did this guy play the game? Or just watch gameplay?"
Katana Zero,Ign gotta fire this guy
Katana Zero,Just imagine what askiisoft could do with a full development studio and stuff
Katana Zero,"“The biggest issue though, is that very little feels resolved by the time the credits roll” 
Ign be like: Ye this guy doesn’t understand art or stories. Hire him."
Katana Zero,"Just finished this game!
It was amazing!"
Katana Zero,"Ign write your reviews better, nameless, poor story either your as soused as zero's neihbor or just lazy, if its the latter remember the average game is like 5 hours"
Katana Zero,"The only problem is that the game ends, need sequel"
Katana Zero,Fun fact: videogamedunkey is friends with the guy who made this game
Katana Zero,"""The story doesn't quite hit.""
This was the best video game story I've ever seen since Bioshock Infinite."
Katana Zero,"""Katana Zero's story doesn't quite hit the high note that it's action does""

Were you off taking a dump while the rooftop scene was playing?"
Katana Zero,one my favourite games on the switch so far
Katana Zero,"Its made by devolver digital, who make enter the gungeon"
Katana Zero,This game's story is amazing
Katana Zero,"Games too hard,dropped"
Katana Zero,Turn off screen shake smh
Katana Zero,"I heard there's an option in Katana Zero to turn off the flashing lights. If this is true,  can anyone here tell me if it works before I buy the game. Watching reviews made me dizzy because of those flashing lights. Thanking you in advance for your help."
Katana Zero,Just picked this little title up for 8.99 woohoo. Music is   perfection
Katana Zero,One hit kill....no thank you
Katana Zero,"""The story doesn't quite hit''
He clearly is one of the people who skip the dialogs"
Katana Zero,Played the game few days ago. So much better than most AAA titles that come out now days.
Katana Zero,I watched this in the middle of the store cuz my lil bro thought it looked cool so I got it ind I do not regret it 4.5 stars reminds me of my friend pedro
Katana Zero,"If anyone is wondering whether they should play this game or not, if you like noir, synthwave, ninjas and a masterfully written story, then THIS game is for you."
Katana Zero,"oh lord i really, really, really hope there will be a sequel to this game, i beat it in 2 days and i've never felt so mad that i've beaten a game so quickly, it is such a masterpiece."
Katana Zero,"By now I feel like people are nitpicking IGN,s reviews,"
Katana Zero,"Im 14 yet i cant get it on the saitch because i ""am not eligble to purachase or view infomation about this software"" im like no dude this would be my kind of game"
Katana Zero,I’m convinced y’all really don’t play games
Katana Zero,STRAMBINO MAGICO DIVINO FAVOLOSO DAVIDE STRAMBINO..
Katana Zero,Amazing Game. I love almost everything about the game. I was always confused on whether to use Dpad or Analog. Analog accidentally kept dropping me downwards when I didn’t want and Dpad didn’t feel fluid for slashing. 5/5 for me. If I wasn’t dolaying other games I would definitely try hard mode or speedrun. Definitely One day.
Katana Zero,the exaggerated swagger of an amnesiac chronos addict
Katana Zero,"Back here in 2020




Still LIT"
Katana Zero,I've been playing this on Game Pass and I bloody love it so much. My friend who games on Playstation tried to get it but it's not showing up on PS Store but on Google it says it was released April 18th 2019?
Katana Zero,"The only problem I've seen with this game is the enemies targeting, in several later stages you will NOT see the person who shot you. Leading to multiple times of me just quitting in the middle of a level."
Katana Zero,"Also check out I am the Hero, another masterpiece 2D fast paced beat em up"
Katana Zero,Bought several games on sale and played this while it downloaded and then played the whole thing in one sitting . Its now 7 am. Time to smoke some weed eat a meatball sub then go vote kanye west for president
Katana Zero,Is this a rogue like metroidvania?
Katana Zero,This game had one of the hardest bosses
Katana Zero,the story is the best part of the game.
Katana Zero,Does anyone understand the dialogue bar and how timing and response options work? Sorry if I missed it.
Katana Zero,It looks like my friend pedro and the messenger had a child. Definitely gotta buy this
Katana Zero,Why is this r rated
Katana Zero,Shoutout to game pass for the hookup. Had no idea this existed until it dropped on there. Played it through in one sitting. Definitely reccomend!
Katana Zero,3:10 somebody didn't watch the credits.
Katana Zero,Game pass anyone?
Katana Zero,K i m o n o?
Katana Zero,elon musk
Katana Zero,"So, you play as Doppio."
Katana Zero,"""My Friend's Samurai"""
Katana Zero,"""Katana Zero puts you in control of an nameless samurai assassin with the power to manipulate time and see into the future""







So.. it's King Crimson?"
Katana Zero,This really makes you feel like a samurai
Katana Zero,iran
Katana Zero,This or deadly premonition
Katana Zero,Hey can you help me should I get katana zero or samurai Gunn?
Katana Zero,"So far playing the game, the story is surprisingly interesting"
Katana Zero,"Finished this game a year ago, but just wanna drop this comment to encourage people to buy this excellent game."
Katana Zero,Just here to endorse this game. Its great. You should get it.
Katana Zero,Hes not nameless his name is zero.
Katana Zero,DO NOT TALK TO ELECTROHEAD
Katana Zero,"If Braid and The Dishwasher were combined into one game, this would be it."
Katana Zero,The yasuo she tells u not to worry about
Katana Zero,This game reminds me of Super Time Force Ultra
Katana Zero,The story definitely went over this guys head.
Katana Zero,"I personally think the story is its high point. This review was kind of shallow. He could've talked about how dialogue choices *really* affect the ending and the final boss, and that the replayability is high because there are secrets throughout the game that allow you to unlock new weapons. Besides that, the story might be simple, but it's presented in a almost perfect way. The story telling of this game is amazing. This is Chrono Trigger's successor for me in terms of how complete a game can be."
Katana Zero,You can tell that they didn't 100% it
Katana Zero,I personally give it a 9.5
Katana Zero,But my least fav char is V doe :c
Katana Zero,looks awesome
Katana Zero,Does this game have any inappropriate stuff?
Katana Zero,this game is a masterpiece!! Can anyone suggest more of the same genre? i liked gunpoint too
Katana Zero,ITS NOT FOOKIN DONE
Katana Zero,"""a plot that feels like it's saving its best ideas for a sequel""??!!

Dude, did you even finish the game? the story wraps up pretty nicely, with a couple very interesting twists. The plot, story, and premise, are pretty mature and dark for such a game....And the sequel's setup is only revealed in the pre & post credits!"
Katana Zero,"Is there any other game comparable to this on switch? This is my favorite game of all time... for the story, simplicity, mystery, twists, and constantly keeping things fresh. I am dying for something else like this....... anyone got any recommendations? Wish they would make a sequel or release a DLC, anything. I’ve beaten it  so many times over even the secret boss more than once...."
Katana Zero,The story was incredible idk what you guys are talking about
Katana Zero,We need katana zero 2
Katana Zero,"just now hearing of this game. seems somewhat similar to dead cells, which was pretty awesome. definitely buying this for the quarantine."
Katana Zero,"Dead sekiro cells, hotline edition"
Katana Zero,"“The story doesn’t quite hit” 
This man must be as high as the characters in this game"
Katana Zero,Hey guys! I've been really enjoying my time reviewing games recently. It's just felt so much fun! I hope you enjoy this review - any of you LEON fans as well? Mark
Katana Zero,"3 years ago you reviewed this game. Today your review's gonna show me why this game's worth it! At the start of the vid you said you had 30k subs, right now 3 years later you have 303k! I'm happy you made it so far! Hope you get to half a mil before you know it! :)"
Katana Zero,you out a minus next to Excellent story :')
Katana Zero,way to spoil the story dooshebag
Katana Zero,Damn im 2yrs late to this review
Katana Zero,"I heard there's an option in Katana Zero to turn off the flashing lights. If this is true,  can anyone here tell me if it works before I buy the game. Watching reviews made me dizzy because of those flashing lights. Thanking you in advance for your help."
Katana Zero,"I heard there's an option in Katana Zero to turn off the flashing lights. If this is true,  can anyone here tell me if it works before I buy the game. Watching reviews made me dizzy because of those flashing lights. Thanking you in advance for your help."
Katana Zero,the daily show
Katana Zero,"This game got me into speed running it, not that I'm good at it, but it got me into speed running it either way"
Katana Zero,This or the messenger? Decisions
Katana Zero,"This is like 9 bucks on the e store sale right now, also Leon is deff one of the greatest films of all time 💪🏻😂 soon as I got the hotline Miami vibes I got chills I said omg I already love this game"
Katana Zero,"Time limits on anything other than racers or sometimes fighters are annoying. Will pass on switch, seems there's a cheat engine to freeze the time bar for steam, though :D"
Katana Zero,I'm like 6 months late but I just beat this game. Holy hell it's good. Just came here to see what you guys had to say.
Katana Zero,A unique platformer
Katana Zero,This looks like a lot of action and good graphics
Katana Zero,"I seriously love this game, I finished it in a few days but I'll have to play it again soon."
Katana Zero,"Great game, it's a blast!  That motorcycle stage shown in the review is especially awesome."
Katana Zero,"You put ""excellent story"" as a negative at the end!"
Katana Zero,"The story....everyone is sleeping on the story of this game. You guys did the most decent review iv seen on it but still. It's not Hotline Miami, it's not Hitman and it's not John Renno. Its literally  Crank with an actual storyline. Your literally  dieting because of the drug and it explains it all. Up till the point of ""To be contenued""."
Katana Zero,Have you guys ever thought about doing Lets plays or maybe streaming some switch games? I'd like to see how good you guys are hehe :P just a thought.
Katana Zero,When excellent story is a negative
Katana Zero,I’m torn between getting this or Cuphead;  Should I get both??
Katana Zero,ohhhhh I looove this. The glowing slowmo movements look fantastic. EPIC
Katana Zero,i think that this is a really good game but it isn t as hard as every youtuber say in my second run i done the whole game without time slowing and it only took me 3 hours (i would enjoyed a few more fases for the end game boss)
Katana Zero,Best game in along time imo
Katana Zero,This game is so much fun and it’s one of the best looking game I’ve played (just behind cuphead). Though I personally don’t own it my friend does. This channel is breaking my wallet.
Katana Zero,"very helpful, thanks"
Katana Zero,"Heyyy !!... So so soooooooo... so so sooo so... so so... so so so so so so so so... so... so so... so so so... so... so sooo soooooooo so so so so so so so so so so so so so so... so ... sooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Cool !! 
Love this punchy game !! Thanks for review.
It’s always a pleasure."
Katana Zero,I forgot the bullet time mechanic even existed while I played.
Katana Zero,Love your vids have a nice day
Katana Zero,I’m hoping they do a Limited Run release of this game.   I’m sure they will since it’s Devolver..
Katana Zero,How are we gonna play without game journo mode!!!
Katana Zero,"This seems like a stealth Celeste, I'm more intrigued now"
Katana Zero,"I love the look of this but, I'm sick of all these difficult games....... I don't have time to ""git gud""!"
Katana Zero,I’m loving this game!  And I really appreciate how good of a job you guys do reviewing these games.  Keep it up (switch up that is:)
Katana Zero,I don't really play indie games but I saw this on the switch and GOSH THIS LOOKS SO FUN. I have no money to buy it online right now (under 18 and no debit card) but I really want to get it. I could get it this summer but its gonna be so hard for me to not spoil the game for myself by watching videos online. I did that to Breath of the wild.
Katana Zero,There's a small error at the end. The excellent story was listed as a negative.
Katana Zero,"Excellent review, been looking forward to this one for a while. Can't wait to dive in."
Katana Zero,simply a great review... Picking up doom tho becuz of the discount
Katana Zero,i even like this game more then cuphead. No physical release meh!
Katana Zero,But does it have hotline's story well at least part 2s story.
Katana Zero,"Not had time to watch any videos for a while. Now I see I've got 4 doses of Switch Up goodness waiting for me! 

Best go grab a coffee!

Oh and the game looks dope. Like ""Not a Hero"" in many respects."
Katana Zero,this game is fast and great i pro order  it with cuphead i will start it after i beat cuphead  thanks  for the review  really  enjoyed  watching the review  keep  it up  :)
Katana Zero,This game has really caught me by surprise but looks incredible! Gameplay and aesthetic both definifely my sort of thing so almost certainly a get for me
Katana Zero,"This looks great. Thanks for the run through, Mark. I think I'll wait for My Friend Pedro instead.

I need time to recover after 100% of sekiro. My anxiety can't handle anymore quick action stuff."
Katana Zero,"Bought it...

It's hella nice.

Devolver dropping yet another gem."
Katana Zero,Ah too bad Australia didn't give this game a rating yet so this game isn't available for me
Katana Zero,"Looks like you and Glen had some early Easter gifts today. Both games looks great and difficult.


Enjoy your break"
Katana Zero,Enjoying it much more than Cuphead.
Katana Zero,"i bought this one together with cuphead, it's so good... action is awesome. glad you have reviews of both games. :)"
Katana Zero,I've been waiting for this review
Katana Zero,Yes Mark another banging review another top game. still be waiting on a sale before I snap this one up though. Just because I know they will smash it out at half price soon enough on eshop..... An so many games so little time.
Katana Zero,YEEES THE REVIEW I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR!!!! THANK YOU MARK
Katana Zero,Been looking at your reviews and so far I've been enjoying them. Keep up the good work. Played the game at PAX and it was really fun.
Katana Zero,Yes. Yes. YEEEES!
Katana Zero,"Aside from mechs, katana is one of man's dream... 😂"
Katana Zero,"I'm so glad a reviewer is talking about how much pixel art there is. Like it's pretty and all but I feel that's what most indie games and such are like these days. Like don't get me  wrong this game looks amazing and I'm gonna get it, but it'd be nice to get more non pixel art indie games. This is just my opinion but it is nice that there are reviewers who share this feeling."
Katana Zero,"Another great review!
Thanks Guys"
Katana Zero,Just finished Darkest Dungeon and started Cuphead. I’ll need to return to Stardew Valley for a cool down before I take on this one.
Katana Zero,"Right c'mon now

Who chose to murder the homeless guy?

Or was it just me :/"
Katana Zero,2 reviews in the same weekday phew good thing I had today off from work!
Katana Zero,I loved this review! This should be in the eshop to get folks to buy this game lol hahaha
Katana Zero,Now we need the Hitman games and hotline Miami games on Switch
Katana Zero,Konami shooter package with Gradius and Salamander and Cuphead for me
Katana Zero,"If you give away this game, and I won't win it, I'm going to be so sad! It sounds and looks so amazing. Cheers to the good review guys!"
Katana Zero,This game looks absolutely breath-taking.  I can't wait to sink my teeth into it.
Katana Zero,Grabbin this as soon as i get home 👌
Katana Zero,Did it again...lol excellent story is not a negative!!! I'll pick it up later seeing as cuphead released today as well I'll be sticking my face in that awhile. Does this have playability like dead cells? One reason I always go back to that game is the fast action and excellent responsive controls.
Katana Zero,Thanks for the great review! Been waiting for a review of this. Can't wait to start playing now
Katana Zero,"it looks very aestheticallypleasing but quite short, might give it a try."
Katana Zero,"Looks fun, but its unfortunate when they chose to release this. In the middle of a packed April for Switch releases and on the same day as Cuphead? Its going to have to wait for awhile."
Katana Zero,Give me some good news here baby!!! I just bought Cuphead but I feel incomplete. I’ve been dying for this mother trucker to come out as well. I want physical but it’s such a fantastic game I don’t mind buying it twice to help support the Developer.
Katana Zero,Unreal looking. I really love the way they've chosen to deliver the story. Pretty impressive set of killing skills you have there Mr. Walker
Katana Zero,"This game had me intrigued from the very first trailer so I'm glad to see it score highly! Great review, definitely putting this one on my wishlist!"
Katana Zero,That screen shake kills my eyes but I gather that can be adjusted?
Katana Zero,"Pixel art, one hit deaths, and fast retries? Sounds a lot like Celeste which makes me want to play this game even more lol."
Katana Zero,Really nice review Mark!
Katana Zero,"Great stuff Mark, big up Devolver as always! Cuphead or Katana, just cannot decide at the mo"
Katana Zero,"awesome review,  
just started this game, im loving it so far ,  this and cuphead dropping on the same day is tough to choose ..."
Katana Zero,"The assassin is one of my favorite movies.. this game looks awesome Mark. Wow, don’t mind picking up this game. Love a good challenge 😁😁.. fantastic review.. almost at 30k subscribers.. that means u guys are doing a outstanding job with the channel 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽.. cheers 🍻 Mark & Glen.. and also Jace and Shannon thanks for all you guys reviews too😁😁"
Katana Zero,Finnaly the review I was waiting for!
Katana Zero,"Nice one Mark, looks interesting."
Katana Zero,This game looks so sick and I love it
Katana Zero,That music tho...
Katana Zero,Greetings from Panama!
Katana Zero,Hello
Tunic,Truly impressive
Tunic,"One of the most memorizing game I’ve played within a few years. The level design and the uniqueness of overall vibe, such a brilliant game."
Tunic,"If you're someone who enjoyed Outer Wilds, Obra Dinn, or The Witness (puzzles & mystery-solving) and Hollow Knight or Dark Souls (tight & challenging gameplay) you will adore this title. Beware of spoilers and go play it now!"
Tunic,"Not only one of the best indie games I’ve ever had the pleasure of playing, but one of the best games I’ve ever played period!"
Tunic,Excellent game
Tunic,honestly it sounds like a bad game
Tunic,This def should have won indie game of the year - there's so much more game here than Stray
Tunic,This game has secrets within secrets!
Tunic,Why would you show the final boss battle in this review?
Tunic,Interesting
Tunic,This game is truly amazing and the closest us non Nintendo gamers will get to a Legend of Zelda game.
Tunic,Reynard the fox book old did
Tunic,Deaths door....
Tunic,most slept in game this year easily one of the best
Tunic,"Masterpiece of game design and environmental storytelling. If you happen to be reading the comment before watching, do not watch this review as it contains a ton of spoilers."
Tunic,Love how it was made in Halifax Nova scotia
Tunic,This game is phenomenal the secrets in the game are 😮 crazy can’t recommend it enough!!!
Tunic,This is basically Deaths Door with a fox lol
Tunic,Review full of spoilers.
Tunic,Seriously? This review is full of spoilers
Tunic,Can't get over how beautiful this game is
Tunic,"Ahh, Kingsleys Adventure 2, finally!"
Tunic,Looks like a sequel to Deaths Door but now you’re a fox. lol. Looks like a cool game though
Tunic,Buying this next time it's on sale on steam. It looks fantastic.
Tunic,"It looks amazing, I'm gonna play it"
Tunic,Why is this guy screaming
Tunic,Zelda meets Soulsborne. Bosses had me screaming in frustration.
Tunic,Tunic vs deaths door?
Tunic,The level design and sense of discovery is amazing in this game. Haven't felt this sense of discovery since Dark Souls.
Tunic,I've beat this game like 15 times now
Tunic,Just finished it wow its fantastic the sound track is beautiful aswel .
Tunic,play just cause 337
Tunic,Nah I'll pass
Tunic,Is the game playbale with keyboard and mouse?
Tunic,When you played through did you know you can change your fur color shoes gloves and even clothes in a secret place
Tunic,Fun game until the trashy ending. Didn't finish. Looked up how to finish... not worth anyone's time.
Tunic,"One correction. While there isn’t any difficulty settings, you can turn on “no fail” and/or “no stamina restrictions” in the accessibility menu if you want to. This does not disable achievements or rewards of any kind, so if you are struggling and just want to keep enjoying the game, there is no reason not to!"
Tunic,Certain bosses are hard but this is not a Dark Souls shut up.
Tunic,Would have been nice if the game was less simplistic looking. Less like a monument game.
Tunic,"Tunic made me cry in many ways. A warm surprise of creativity, immersion, tradition, puzzle solving and a deep message. 

It made me cry because this is a LOVE LETTER to high quality game design. Period."
Tunic,Thankfully played it on gamepass. Didn't care for it.
Tunic,Not my type of game. Why waste time to understand how to play the game than actually play it? It just adds unnecessary hours to the gameplay.
Tunic,Reminds me of deaths dpor but harder
Tunic,"""Sus out clues"" 

Really?"
Tunic,Тиджой
Tunic,"Checked every comment, noone seems to have notice enviromental approach to puzzles simillar to the witness"
Tunic,"Is it possible to call this game a ""souls like"" or a ""zelda like""?"
Tunic,Every review now always has to reference some other game. Don't think reviewers now would know how to review without mentioning another game.
Tunic,This dudes voice is the worst sound in the universe
Tunic,Reminds me so much of Death's door. Might just pick this up
Tunic,"Elden Ring, but with a childlike ambiance."
Tunic,can you actually run or is that how fast you move all the time
Tunic,Thank you gamepass
Tunic,"Just got a series x for my bday todayfrom my amazing wife and this is def one of the first games I’m picking up, thanks to NintendoCapriSun for showcasing this one."
Tunic,Anyone but Ryan McCaffrey!
Tunic,The most overrated game of 2022.
Tunic,It is a shame. Your review is so full of spoilers. People should discover this game for themselves.
Tunic,"""nearly all the games dialogue is written in an undecipherable language"", except that's just plain false, it is possible to decipher it, though not necessary to complete the game. It's yet another tier of secret that the hardcore players can enjoy post-game."
Tunic,why in the world would you spoil the final boss in a review
Tunic,9️⃣
Tunic,Did you just show me all the bosses and a bunch of other spoilers?
Tunic,"Hey man you don’t need to yell, I’m right here."
Tunic,so overrated lmao
Tunic,Why is David Cross reviewing games
Tunic,"saying the game is hard is an overstatement.
I'd put it at the medium difficulty in my oppinion.

One thing of advice playing the game: hug walls as much as possible!

[Note: This game does not use a mouse, if you feel uncomfortable playing without a mouse this game will be a lot harder]"
Tunic,Better than Elden Ring
Tunic,So a kiddie looking version of dark souls?? Count me in
Tunic,So Dark Souls x Legend of Zelda
Tunic,Reminds me of secret of mana with the sword and the whip for jumping..
Tunic,"Game Pass is the best thing to ever happen to mankind. Okay, maybe just for gamers. No... for mankind as well."
Tunic,I'll stick with zelda
Tunic,Garbage
Tunic,👏👏👏👏👍👍
Tunic,This looks like the successor to Hyper Light Drifter I've always secretly wanted. Just with a cuter face.
Tunic,"Awesome, thank you so much for this review, will give it a try."
Tunic,Just looks like another one of those. I'm probably not even going to bother with it on PC Pass.
Tunic,This game has been on my radar for quite some time. Glade to see it being well received!!
Tunic,"Randomly stumbled upon this and gonna love everything about it from the looks of things, really hope it comes to PS4 soon."
Tunic,Absolutely Fantastic.
Tunic,Na it's like dark souls u will die again again and again
Tunic,Nintendo Switch port 🙏
Tunic,"Wow this review spoils a lot of the game. Half the fun of Tunic is in the discovery of everything! The video was practically a summary of everything rather than a tasteful sneak peek at the game. Love the audio/script IGN, but a little heavy handed when you even show the final boss"
Tunic,"Having just finished Elden Ring and was looking for something else to play after but also to scratch that itch, this game was perfect for it."
Tunic,so many spoilers in this review smh
Tunic,"Difficulty options is an accessibility feature. For an indie, it's understandable they can't do more due to budget constraints. But one should never be ""unapologetic"" about lacking accessibility features."
Tunic,Why do you talk like that....?
Tunic,One of the best games i've ever played in my life. Almost perfect Metroidvania. Tutorial with pages to find is such a great desigion for this game. Absolutely love it.
Tunic,have to read a manual ... some say its a homage to its retro roots ... but to be honest its just lazy of the developers to not include a toturial
Tunic,It gives me more Death Door vibe than Zelda Links Awakening
Tunic,this review video revealed so many of the secrets you're supposed to puzzle out on your own...
Tunic,when the person that did this review said they wanted a plush doll of the main character…I knew it was the wrong person to review this game.
Tunic,"There are definitely a lot of mechanics similar to those you'll find in Elden Ring, but this game has been equally fun and challenging. Not to mention adorable!"
Tunic,imagine just spoiling the fact that u fight the fox lady even though at the start of the game she seems like a friend
Tunic,Excited about this game heard awesome things about it
Tunic,A great Xbox exclusive!
Tunic,"Wow, english language will make it easy but maybe its also part of game puzzle that's why manuals must be checked everytime. Looks awesome though"
Tunic,Death's Door immediately came to mind. Like Zela yeah .. but almost everything else is Death's Door.
Tunic,What happened to only showing early areas.  You guys showing everything in the game in the review.
Tunic,Feels like some Fez influence in there as well.
Tunic,"As soon as you see ""X plays like Dark Souls"", you're dealing with caricatures of gaming journalism ... or you're simply watching an IGN review."
Tunic,"I belive with time and patience,  this game could've easily done 60 fps lol. If Mortal combat 11 can run in 60 fps why can't this? And mk is more demanding. Lazy devs"
Tunic,This is literally Link dreaming that he's a fox.
Tunic,"The music genre is ambient. Nothing ""lo-fi"" about it."
Tunic,"""Beautifully detailed environments..."" Huh?? More like the opposite of that."
Tunic,"If you all liked this game. Try Death's Door. Its another Zelda like game with a great story, fun puzzles, and rewarding exploration"
Tunic,10/10 game loved exploring the world
Tunic,Am I the only one who thought about Kingsley's Adventure?...
Tunic,Got it on Game Pass for PC and even after just a couple hours I'm blown away. Glad the Switch version holds up. I know what my son's Christmas gift will be.
Tunic,Tunic deserved indie game over stray by a mile
Tunic,Switch oled was perfect for this game.
Tunic,Its one of the best games i have ever played. Worth 29$? Yes.
Tunic,Why does everything need to be copied from Dark Souls? This could've been better as a Landstalker-like.
Tunic,tunic physical???? anyone know?
Tunic,It's such a good indie game... I'll definitely replay it on Switch during Christmas!!!!
Tunic,Why does this game says it has online functions on Nintendo?
Tunic,Nintendo really needs to upgrade its hardware.
Tunic,"Thanks for the review. You just saved me money. This game is not for me then. I was going to buy it, because of the aesthetics, but I don’t like the dead souls games at all."
Tunic,It is honestly a very interesting game but I just can't get over the fact that it's in a made up language. I want to be able to understand the game when I'm playing it
Tunic,Great game! A little short though. My GOTY is still Pokémon Legends Arceus.
Tunic,i just bought this for steam deck and it looks amazing. im confused as heck what to do but it looks like it will be fun
Tunic,not me thinking that was a real language lol
Tunic,Wow. It looks really nice. Will definitely pay for it at some point.
Tunic,The 30fps really is a downer ill get it on steam
Tunic,"Good writer, this Lowell Bell."
Tunic,"Why am I never quite satisfied with an 8. Like I wish there was a decimal on some the well known review sites. I think way back to Suikoden a game I treasure, got like a 6.7 from GameSpot or a different really old site I used to go to back in dial up days."
Tunic,This game is not worth it. The combat is really boring and the world is not fun to explore. Play an actual Zelda game instead of this poor imitation.
Tunic,"soulslike, huh? that immediately makes me lose all interest."
Tunic,lba
Tunic,"This game blew me away and scratched the exploration and sense of discovery itch I've been having since Outer Wilds and Elden Ring. I haven't sat there with a pen and pad trying to figure out puzzles (and the in-game language) like this since The Witness! If you loved those 3 games, 2.5D Zeldas with metroidvania elements, this is the game for you! The best tip I can give (SMALL SPOILER ALERT!)



 is pay VERY close attention to every. single. inch. of. every. single. page! There are secrets and hidden messages hidden everywhere in the pages you find. 9.5/10 (for an indie game)"
Tunic,Such a stellar game! I'm happy to see it come to the Nintendo Switch.
Tunic,Played in game pass with my Zfold35. It's fun
Tunic,"I just finished this game without a guide/walthrough and man, it is one of the most rewarding feeling ever. I even sometimes mulled over puzzles for days (or maybe I'm just stupid)."
Tunic,This is my Goty. The music and the final puzzles are amazing
Tunic,Tunic is cool but I'm lost and not sure where to go.  I'll figure it out one day.
Tunic,"Tunic is great but the port process for Switch still sucks and I wish reviewers were more honest and critical about it. There is absolutely no reason this game isn't running at 60fps at 720p when games like Ender Lilies, Ori: Will of the Wisps, and Hollow Knight are. Portability might somehow be worth putting up with 30fps in 2022 for you, but it's hard for these game's biggest fans to forgive when it isn't really the fault of the Switch hardware like people claim it is, but those responsible for incompetently porting the game over to Switch. 

This review is definitely inflated and comes off more as a sales pitch for the Switch version than an honest review. This video should be comparing Tunic on Switch directly to what you can get from other platforms and asking those in charge of the porting process to do better and make updates. Just look at Cult of the Lamb which, thanks to honest feedback from fans, is now running at 60fps as opposed to the choppy 30fps at launch. Instead this review is mostly just praising the core design of Tunic, which everyone already knew was great, with very little emphasis on that fact that it's a sub-standard port, only occasionally mentioning that before deflecting it with more praise for the design. It's as if you guys don't care about how well the Switch version fairs at all and just want people to buy the game again.

I'm not here to attack the Switch or Tunic or those who are enjoying playing Tunic on Switch but constantly forgiving developers for lackluster Switch ports in these reviews is NOT helping the console improve as a platform, it's only stagnating it. It also does the opposite of helping to educate consumers. Luckily most of your viewers don't seem to notice or care but I do and I hope a reviewer called Nintendo Life actually looks to be more honest about reviewing products on Nintendo hardware in the future. Tunic itself might be an 8 or 9 maybe even a 10 but this review and this port are both far from that."
Tunic,"Currently playing this on PS5 after waiting so long since seeing it first announced, and bigged it up so much my girlfriend got it on Switch xD

This is a strong contender for GOTY for me,  feels like old school Legend of Zelda meshed with some loose Hollow Knight/Metroidvania vibes. The thing I love the most is that because the game doesn't give any in-your-face clues and you have to find the pages for the manual(albiet you've gotta do some guesswork on how it translates), anything you discover feels a lot more rewarding, and I haven't felt that kind of wonder from a game for a looooong time!!

Soundtrack is also awesome!!"
Tunic,I hope the makers release it physically but I heard at the moment that they have no plans release it physically. I just hope they do it
Tunic,"Hi, I received a message from Nintendo Life that I had won a Switch from them, did anyone know if that is real? 
I didn't know about a raffle of a Switch??? Or is that guy a faker and tries to trick people. He wants 40% of the shipping cost."
Tunic,"Amazing game, but Jesus Christ is it hard, both the combat and the post-game puzzles."
Tunic,"I'm a huge Tunic fan from playing it on Game Pass, I even got a plushie! But I admit I was very letdown to know Switch couldn't do 60fps. If anything, the smoothness in animations is the most important feel for this game's style, specially when you consider you have to learn attack patterns. I wish they would instead tone down the post-processing to allow for pure 1080p 60fps on the Switch. Maybe some of the iconic visuals would be gone, but the experience would still be smooth and crisp."
Tunic,This game will stick around with my mind forever. Amazing.
Tunic,The Switch is way past its age now that event these games are struggling to keep the gameplay smooth and good looking. The quality is bad and this game should be played at 60fps at least.
Tunic,I'd be bored of this game in 10 minutes
Tunic,"This game is beautiful. If you u want to experience it to the fullest, go pick it up on PC or home consoles."
Tunic,"I'm glad it's worked its way to Switch + PS5 and even thematically I'd want it on my Switch (because old school Zelda vibes) , being able to also play on PS5 sounds like the move for me at least."
Tunic,"Looks a lot like Death’s Door. If anyone wants a Tunic-esque experience, DD is beautiful and quaint; the puzzles never stumped, but some combat areas and bosses did provide a decent challenge. 100% in just under 24 hours. And it goes on sale every now and then."
Tunic,"Ooof.  Yeah, looks way better on Xbox."
Tunic,"I have always hated Zelda games, but Tunic is amazing."
Tunic,"I had been holding out on buying the game until if/when it came to Switch, so I was absolutely overjoyed at the announcement during the Direct. I preordered it almost immediately, and put a few hours into it last night. I've really enjoyed what I've played so far! There were a few moments of head scratching, but after looking at the game manual pages I'd found, I figured out what I was missing. I really have to hand it to the developers for employing such a clever hook.

I did actually play the demo on the Xbox One so I'm aware of its original graphical quality, but the lower FPS and resolution haven't really bothered me. There is this subtle graininess to the visuals that comes across as a stylistic choice more than a workaround for fewer pixels, and I haven't felt like 30 fps has marred the gameplay at all. I haven't reached any bigger bosses yet so I can't speak to the hitches/pauses.

All told, I was excited about a Switch release of the game and I'm very satisfied with what they delivered!"
Tunic,"Love the game and review, but tbh I'm a bit surprised there's no disclaimer that this is made by the partner of a Nintendo Life staff member."
Tunic,Switch cant even play its own exclusive BOTW without hiccups. Old ass hardware from 2015 released in 2017
Tunic,So glad I didn't buy this game. I'm do tired of buying a game that's visually appealing and gives massive zelda vibes. But add souls in every f#cking game? Every f#ck8ng game? The difficulty spikes would ruin this game for me.
Tunic,Watching another Nintendo life video with “is it worth it?” In the title… is it worth it?
Tunic,I'd really like a demo for this. I'd like to see what the resolution is like in handheld. I can deal with 30fps but not sub 720p when I have the option of a PS5 copy.
Tunic,"Im realy hopeing it gets a physical release, i hardly download games as i like haveing actual phisical media foŕ my money. 

So i dont know weather to wait and hope for a phisical release or download it because this is a game i do want to play at some point soon"
Tunic,This masterpiece deserves to be played at 144hz max graphics settings. It's incredible on PC
Tunic,On of the top games of the year. I played on PC several months ago.
Tunic,"""A small fox like creature wearing a green tunic like a certain other character"" KINGSLEY!?!?! AS IN THE ADVENTURES OF? Oh you mean link ... damnit"
Tunic,I waited too buy Tunic too come too the Nintendo Switch too play the game with my 4 year old son he is too smart and said it's like Zelda and Link I started him young lol. The handheld and accessibility comes into play when my kids that  want too watch cartoons as well.
Tunic,I might enjoy this. At first I thought I wouldn’t have the skill nor patience… then I remembered that I beat Hollow Knight and beat White Palace sooo… I bet I could do it
Tunic,It's been forever since I first saw the reveal trailer for this game!
Tunic,This needs a physical copy so bad
Tunic,This needs a physical copy so bad
Tunic,This looks good.
Tunic,"I’m so excited for this! I’ve never played a Dark Souls game, mostly because I prefer games to be less dark, but this just looks so perfect for me."
Tunic,I want to get this on ps5 for the beautiful graphics but I want to be able to play on the go ugh idk wich to get it on
Tunic,"This woulda been my OST of the year by a landslide (But Sephonie really surprised me), still some amazing songs that I will be listening to for years ❤"
Tunic,yikes it looks a little rough compared to series X
Tunic,"if you get stuck towards the end and feel the need to look up a walkthrough - DO NOT DO THIS, it ruins the whole experience and I highly recommend keeping yourself blind right up till the end or you'll rob yourself of something truly special"
Tunic,"Yeah, I’m not paying 40 bucks for a game that shouldn’t be more than 20 with all the caveats on Switch in comparison to playing it for free on XBSX with game pass in 4K and 60 fps."
Tunic,Game of the year.
Tunic,"Huh, surprised at that performance gap given its scope as a game."
Tunic,"Tunic is definitely my goty. 10/10 Granted, I did play it on game pass on the Series X. Just watching those makes me want to go back to it because it is such a well made game."
Tunic,This review is easily selling me on buying it
Tunic,"Does it play better on Steamdeck?  I was holding out for the Switch with the OLED screen, but doesn’t sound like it’s as good there."
Tunic,ew… whoever made the ui needs to fired but other than that it looks alright
Tunic,"Even though I only played it a few months ago, when I saw these clips I felt nostalgia, kind of like a Christmas day when I was a kid kind of feeling, it’s hard to explain.
Idk if it’s the fact that there’s no dialogue or the cozy graphics but it felt like such a special world. It was a very beautiful, sometimes frustrating and very fun experience. I specially loved collecting the book pieces, brought me back to those SNES days where I used to read and reread the books while trying to redraw the characters because they were full of art, good times.
Really hoping for a sequel!"
Tunic,Is it getting a physical release?
Tunic,That’s a big problem the switch is having a hard time runing games the way The game developers intended
Tunic,"I played this on Game Pass earlier this year with a friend of mine.  He and I like to play single player games with a lot of emphasis on exploration 'together' by each playing on our own, but in the same room.  We tend to have very different approaches in how we each go about exploring such games, so it's fun to see what the other one found, and of course it's also a lot of fun to have someone to immediately and excitedly share you're own new and cool discoveries with.

This game was incredible for the exploration isn't just the world, but also how you play the game and navigate the world, so we both had plenty of moments where one of us found something, then the other would exclaim ""How'd you do that (or where'd you find that), wait, no I want to figure it out"""
Tunic,"The beginning and the middle of this game are AMAZING, but the last few hours are kinda lacking. It gets super confusing and the dificulty skyrockets all of a sudden. But still a great game."
Tunic,Anyone heard whether or not we will see a physical release of Tunic?
Tunic,Look good but i dont understand why the Devs makes Games that are frustating after a few Bosses..yeah ITS OK to need 20 trys but Not 100
Tunic,I got this on Gamepass not even a week ago ad cannot recommend it enough. Its everything I'd want Nintendo to do in a new 2D Zelda and a lot more
Tunic,I'm getting links awakening vibes here🤔
Tunic,I think that's pretty cool the instructions become collectables that's a new one😁
Tunic,Tunic is amazing. I find it a little too hard for my liking but I still love it all the same. Super charming!
Tunic,would’ve been a crime if this game wasn’t ported over to the Switch.
Tunic,"I played this one on my Series S. It is an amazing game  but I felt that towards the endgame the difficulty becames too hardcore, I had to go through some walkthroughs to be able to properly finish the story."
Tunic,this review is much more honest then the review on nintendo world report
Tunic,"Waiting for a physical version with a manual on an envelope that reads ""Do not open until you have completed your quest!"" 📜"
Tunic,"I finished this game 100%, and It's a very special one.
You forgot to talk about the multiple Endings. Thant Hard fight is not a must to do."
Tunic,I am no game programmer but it is odd that tunic is not 60 fps on Switch. This is not exactly a very graphically intensive game.
Tunic,Where can I get the physical copy bro ?
Tunic,I was definitely waiting for the Switch version. Another one for the backlog. ;)
Tunic,"I wasnt thinking much of this game till now.

Thanks guys!"
Tunic,I felt a bit like this over the Tourist a few years back. I gave up after not being able to beat the second boss. He was crazy frustrating (the rock-style snake thing where you had to drop small boulders over about 5 holes in the ground to stop water from shooting up. But by the time you'd get to the 5th hole he'd have already started knocking the 1st & 2nd ones off & you'd have to start the process over. I'm just getting too old to keep wanting to torture myself like that. Which is a shame really since it was a great fun little adventure game. Pity it got so difficult 30 minutes in.
Tunic,Is there an easy mode
Tunic,looks awful on the switch
Tunic,Fox Link
Inside,"Soooo this game got a 10, and Hallow Knight a 9.4? I’ve played this game as well and I’d give it a 7.5"

Inside,Only a few games come close to being perfect like portal
Inside,"Inside's ending is one of the most shocking, curve ball endings ever honestly. This Game really knew how to push the lever in the final section and completely flip everything on its head and derail before it got boring."
Inside,An excellent game. One I'll definitely play again.
Inside,Should be said though: you will regularly witness a child's death by every imaginable means.
Inside,One of the best games ever

Inside,This is one of the best games I've ever played. Don't forget to look for the secret ending!

Inside,"Even if you don't love platforming games, get this."

Inside,"I've only just recently discovered this game and it is without a doubt one of the greatest gaming experiences of my life (and I'm 44 now). Im struggling to think of the last time a game made me step back and say ""Wow"". An absolute masterpiece. Thank you Playdead"
Inside,This was a great game. Towards the end was enjoyable and one of the gaming moments I can remember
Inside,This game isn’t that great
Inside,"Damn it.  I just bought No Man's Sky and started downloading it for a new game experience RIGHT BEFORE finding this video.  I've added the Limbo & Inside bundle on PSN to my cart though, so when I go looking for a new game in a month or two I'll definitely remember these.  I've never played a game that looks or plays like this one does, and I'm exceptionally intrigued."
Inside,I’ve no idea why it took me 4 years to play this game.  It’s incredible.
Inside,"You won't find this type of game from anywhere
Thanks IGN for rating this game as *MASTERPIECE*"
Inside,"I remember completely ruining this game for myself by watching an entire walkthrough from Pewdiepie.  A few years later I don’t remember a single thing that I watched except the overall plot twist, meaning I could buy this and get a generally fresh gameplay experience."
Inside,Will it come on a mobile phone?? I have never purchased a game before but I want this very 😭😭
Inside,"I remember when I started playing this game and I am absolutely glad that I did :D, this is hand down one of the best games I have ever played"
Inside,Just finished this game.. Amazing game.. 10/10..😍
Inside,"I bought this game on iOS and all I can say is that, it’s worth it!!! 👍🏻"
Inside,best game ever
Inside,"Inside: Yep give me that Masterpiece!

Six: Am I a joke to you?"
Inside,This game has one of the best storylines I've ever played. And I mean it seriously.
Inside,"This game is simply awesome and astonishing, awesome review of a great game :)"
Inside,3:42 yo never play that level before
Inside,Limbo and Inside seem to be inspired by the old classic Another World/Out of this world.
Inside,"Just finished playing this, WOW!!!!!!!!!!! MY MIND IS ABSOLUTELY BLOWN!!!!!! The ending is incredible and the look and feel of the game is just stunning! Easy 10/10 from me as well!"
Inside,Little Nightmares > Inside
Inside,"Are we supposed to not know whats going on from the start, or did i miss something??"
Inside,It’s free for me I just use my 190 gold point on my switch and it’s on sale for 19kr in Sweden
Inside,I played Inside for the first time beat it in 3.5 hours its alright noway its better than Limbo though.
Inside,Just like a little nightmare
Inside,I tried it on my iPad the first 4-5 puzzles are free then you have to buy it but I'm dirt poor
Inside,"Worst ending Iv ever experienced, wanted more of the game or more replay value with other routes"
Inside,It's worth it
Inside,"Ok wait! I have just found this game and downloaded the free trial. It’s interesting for sure. I’m not yet looking for solutions as I like figuring the stuff out as far as I can. Yet, you just accidentally showed me the goal to my first frustrating puzzle at the fridge. Not sure how you did that but I now know it can be done. I thought I tried everything but I’m back at it now. Not sure I’m happy about the unwanted help yet."
Inside,same
Inside,"Super late to the party, but I bought the digital version for Switch a few days ago when it went on sale for $1.99. All it took was a few screenshots to make me want to give it a shot.  Immediately hooked, and finished it within 48 hours.  *11/10*"
Inside,This and limbo are only $2 on switch right now
Inside,It would be great if there was more of this world to explore
Inside,Just played this through and LOVED IT
Inside,"Playing this now in Dec 2022. It is there somewhere in the depths of PS Plus or PS Store. Search it, buy it if you have to, just play it. 10/10"
Inside,"3:28 Maybe in exteriors, but interiors reminds me to Portal 2, when you are in the old Aperture science."
Inside,"Good people with PS plus subscription, this one is available there!"
Inside,This shit is $2 on eshop and I’m still not buying
Inside,"I got this game for two dollars on sale recently and I have to say, I really really like it. The strongest part though is the opening scene. I felt more tension in that scene than the rest of the game, and was sort of disappointed when it never really got to that level again"
Inside,Just got this on Switch for £1.79! Can't wait to try it out now :D
Inside,Little Nightmares
Inside,There was a sale so I got it for $2
Inside,Found this and limbo for 2.00 on the eshop on the nintendo switch
Inside,"One of the worst games ive played in years, puzzles where boaring and easy, sounds was really poor, game was very short, atleast i played it for free on gamepass i would pay 1$ for it....really dont get the hype what so ever."
Inside,"I missed out on playing Limbo when it was on GamePass 

I wont make the same mistake 💯

EDIT: 3 Months late November 2022 ok NOW i wont make the same mistake 😅😅💯"
Inside,"just downloaded from Xbox gamepass today, looking forward to playing."
Inside,Thank you internet for not spoiling this game. Just played for first time.  Loved it. Beautifully bleak masterpiece.
Inside,I looked this game up because it’s only 2 dollars in the eShop but judging by these comments it’s 100% worth it
Inside,On sale for two bucks on the switch right now
Inside,"Thanks for the review. I'll grab it. It's 90% right now, so seems like a bargain."
Inside,"Sick gonna get it for 2 bucks on the Switch today, SUCKAZ. 😎"
Inside,"@3:35 . . .'the game isn't very long. . . ""

As I've noticed with many game developers since HL2 came out ( the first game I played with greatly improved graphics with reduced amount of levels), they've decided to adopt the business model of food manufacturers who retain the same size packaging while reducing the contents.

Perhaps in the future games will still cost the same as now, but with only 5mins of gameplay. The devolution is done slowly so as not to set off any alarms, thus many folks will continue to willingly allow themselves to be ripped off.

Personally, I don't care how amazing looking these indie produced games are, how much effort and passion they appear to put into their creations...if they only have around 6hrs of gameplay, I wouldn't even hand over $5 for them."
Inside,"For some reason I never got Inside or Limbo until 3 days ago, I completed limbo in about 90 minutes and I'm a bit more than half way through Inside now. I absolutely love these games and I think I'll be playing it over and over throughout my life."
Inside,@2:26 You said it kinda resembles Half-Life 2! My guy! I said the same thing the day after I beat it.
Inside,$1.99 for me
Inside,"I’m in the middle of playing this and all the “it’s so easy” “it’s not very challenging” “you won’t get stuck or frustrated” took a hit to my self esteem because I got frustrated, stuck and had to take a break a number of times. So if that was you too you aren’t alone!"
Inside,Great game. Buy it it’s worth it and fun
Inside,Portal portal 2 limbo and inside are works of art
Inside,The end vexed me😂 but I love the game tho 🫶🏾
Inside,I thought of Half Life 2 as well
Inside,"Are there any more games like this one
I played it
Its too short but entertaining"
Inside,"The exact moment I thought of playing something else the game ended, so it's definitely worth playing all the way through. I'd give it a 7.5 or 8 out of 10. It's a good game but doesn't make it into my top 10 games of all time."
Inside,I played this game 10 times already and I’m still not bored of it
Inside,Haahahaahahahahahhahahahaha I Did not Buy This Game I Downloaded-For Free anyone Know This Don't Buy This Game Downloaded From Sites And Download For Free
Inside,I got Limbo and Inside for $7 on eShop
Inside,My favorite indie game
Inside,"I'm watching a free to play game now  on
BEFORE YOU BUY  lmao"
Inside,It seems like a mix of unravel and little nightmares
Inside,i LOVE this game
Inside,This game is a work of Art
Inside,"I just finished it for the first time yesterday, and it was an absolute delight to play through. The world INSIDE is set in has so much intrigue, cool worldbuilding and memorable areas. Because of its small details and achievements, it's as good as infinitely replayable. It also has secrets!!
The character-animations are the elements I like the most; every sprite feels like there's a weight to them, and that they have different personalities (funny, considering none of them have faces). 
It's just charming and a blast through and through, and I think it's one of my favorite games of all time."
Inside,"The ending is wack in my opinion, really short for a $20 game"
Inside,Plot: human resources just need a nice vacation at seaside. Pink Floyd sountrack would be perfect for this game.
Inside,Still my favourite game. I felt so powerful in the end and it genuinely excited me and would love to play it for the first time again.
Inside,There’s a free trial and a paid version. Any difference ?
Inside,The thumbnail of this video is nightmare fuel
Inside,I am gon a get this for my birthday
Inside,I just bought this today
Inside,It’s like $5 on psn January sale
Inside,Omg I finished this game 2021 now this is not a game ! This is art !
Inside,"Play at night, all lights off and feel that game"
Inside,Im lucky i download it for free because of discount
Inside,"This is not a game, It an EMOTION......"
Inside,Coming back 4 years later cuz now its free😏
Inside,I love watching a “before you buy” after i buy
Inside,"Ok well can someone explain to me when on ps4 i buy full game and when i come to the point ""continue?"" i click continue adventure but it brings me to ps4 store page even though i already bought it... did I just waste my money for no reason?"
Inside,"I call Inside an arthouse game, it's a really weird thing that may have some sort of philosophy in it but it's too complicated to understand, at least for me. Ending was terrible by the way, but game itself is incredible"
Inside,its an amazing  sort game i got this game for £4.00 of PSN i love it just go buy it NOW lol
Inside,before you crack
Inside,Download from torrent ! 😂
Inside,Hooked on this . genius game
Inside,Going to buy today it's £3.99 on ps store XD
Inside,"Finally 2020 and we are coming closer to the release of the next game. Limbo was great but Inside is absolutely insane till this date. My playtime sofar 33 hours, I couldn't recommend this enough. I just love it. Anyone that didn't have the experience yet... Go for it !"
Inside,"Half a year.
The half of the game.
About 5 day’s without pauses.
But I am not a really good gamer."
Inside,"I am soooo late. I use to play video games like mad. I stopped 11yrs ago. I’m stuck in Italy n can’t get back to NYC. I downloaded Limbo and  Inside by recommendation from my youngest gamer brother that moved to japan. These two games are the best I’ve ever experienced. Incredible graphics, storyline, game play. I have been looking on line for anything like this. I’m wondering why now all games before this seem cheap lol. These two are more than AMAZING! Next level. Looking forward to more from Playdead."
Inside,"Finished in 2 days..... 20$ for 2 days of playing........ it’s super fun don’t get me wrong it just needs 
 to be extended"
Inside,"Do you know, is there a successor of inside?"
Inside,This game gave so much Half Life 2 vibes.
Inside,Can you save game if you owe the full version on iOS ? Or do you always have to restart ???
Inside,"It's on sale on steam for 6 bucks now.
I'm torn between getting this or starbound"
Inside,I got this game for free on Xbox one due to a monthly free game and honestly I don’t know why it was for free. It amazing
Inside,Just replayed it again. Still remarkable
Inside,"This was my first instabuy game on a phone EVER, and I have enjoyed every single second of it."
Inside,"Just rename this to ""After you Buy"""
Inside,Just buy it
Inside,I just played this game and holy shit its some freakyshit ! The underwater girl had me trippen lol then when you think its all good you turn in to A BIG mashed up pile of humans !!
Inside,"I now this is an old video, but this game is included in ms game pass. Give it a try, it is such a great game!"
Inside,"Second viewing of this video, now that it’s on game pass I’ll check it out!"
Inside,20bucks for so many creepy wallpapers :)
Inside,This whole game made me say what the whole time besides the end then I was screaming WTF. 10/10 tho great game.
Inside,lol I got this for free on Xbox live
Inside,Before you buy don’t buy cuz it’s free on mobile 😂
Inside,Little nightmares is awesome too
Inside,It reminds me a lot of Little Nightmares.
Inside,Shitty Ending after all u do in game   to die in the end Is pointless
Inside,Is it weird that I played Inside before I played Limbo?
Inside,If you buy Inside/limbo... Which one should you play first?
Inside,I accidentally downloaded it.. I played it before I watched this... It’s just. Beautiful.
Inside,2d games. See everything on one side. Whats happening behind the camera ya know
Inside,I bought this game and limbo for $7.99 in a bundle.
Inside,I got it on sale on ps4 for 6 bucks
To the Moon,"I'm in my 30s, and two grueling battles with cancer have left me severely disabled and bedridden. I know I'm not long for this world. This game hit so close to home. I'd love to relive my life, the happy moments, even the sad. My first love, getting to know my dad again after he quit drinking, holding my brother's daughter the first time as a baby. Even just roleplaying through it again would be so soothing."
To the Moon,is the ios version as good as the switch? The ios is like $4.00
To the Moon,The tile puzzles are a pallet cleanser.
To the Moon,Bruh this music
To the Moon,"Fuckin hell, what is it with Nintendo and the obsession with games that look like 8bit RPGs, side scrollers of some form, or fuckin anime novel stories? Talk about a colossal waste of potential."
To the Moon,One of the best game i have ever played  & I couldn't stop crying 😥
To the Moon,I've choked up for a few games over the years. This game had me sobbing.
To the Moon,i like the pc graphics much more... idk why
To the Moon,"Maybe I've heard too many stories, but ""Doctors who help dying people crash their car"" opening sounds a lot like foreshadowing to me.
Not sure if this game is for me enough to buy the physical edition, but I am intrigued enough to look it up when I've cleared away some of the backlog."
To the Moon,"Definitely looks like a hidden gem 💎! I just picked up a physical copy from LRG, cant wait to play! 👍"
To the Moon,"What bothers me slightly is the change in graphics. They aren't so bad and they shouldn't ruin the game as a whole. Small price to pay for such an amazing story on the go.
I just don't want to see more beautiful games with severe graphical downgrades like Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons..."
To the Moon,You can tell by the way this game is reviewed that this guy is not a gamer.
To the Moon,This is a master class game. This should be a movie or at least a mini serie.
To the Moon,"I like how this review is honest and gives me more information than I would by people who was biased towards the game otherwise. It's definitely helping me make my decision of buying it or not, which is nice."
To the Moon,Cry? I'm not crying. Just cleaning my eyes for 30 minutes
To the Moon,"Can’t get enough of this game, so ended up getting for my switch too...."
To the Moon,"God no matter how many times I play this game, that bittersweet ending will always get to me."
To the Moon,this isnt the 1997 ps1 moon remake is it?
To the Moon,"I found this game really disappointing, but I'm glad so many people got something much deeper from it."
To the Moon,first game that make me cry
To the Moon,RPG MAKER?
To the Moon,"Games has been patched, got the update today"
To the Moon,"Ive only cried very few times like this game made me cry, ths is definitely one of the best games ive ever played"
To the Moon,Thx
To the Moon,I cant buy it does anyone have the same Problem? I really want to Play this game but idk Nintendo wont let me buy it on the e-shop. Can anyone Help?
To the Moon,"Damn why did I stop using RM2k. 😭😭😭

Told myself back in 2002 no one would ever play 2D games ever again and I was wasting my time."
To the Moon,my biggest gripes are not being able to walk diagonally and the loading screens (i'm surprised there are any considering how powerful the switch is)
To the Moon,Mine keeps crashing at the same part ;~;
To the Moon,Does it come with the sequel?
To the Moon,"I'm not the biggest fan of the interactive story genre per se, but this one is most definitely one of my personal favorites. The anime adaptation is in works and I'm very much looking forward to it."
To the Moon,Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind: The Game?
To the Moon,About damn time.
To the Moon,great review
To the Moon,Did they they fix the controls/walk issue with this game?
To the Moon,"There definitely needs to be a lot more games with as good autism representation as this one. Actually, disability representation in general in games needs to become more of a thing."
To the Moon,"Here’s the game

Character 1: Hi I’m going to the moon

Character 2: okay

Character 1:I’m on the moon now

Character 1&2: wahhh booooo hooo were sad now and crying on the moon.... :.(

The End!

JK I’ve nvr actually played the game but I’m sure it’s very good and well worth a play through."
To the Moon,"Definitely a pickup after I finish World End Syndrome. Managed to pick up the physical copy after trying hard for 2 months for reasonable price xD

Edit : Picked it up as it has 20% off and had some coins left"
To the Moon,This loser put the game on switch but not ps4...hipster at his finest
To the Moon,This game is so good. Can’t wait to have it on switch! Thanks for this video. Reminded me how much I like the game
Her Story,About FMV wait a sec! Gabriel Knight 2 was awesome
Her Story,Her Story is probably the best use of an unreliable narrator in a video game.
Her Story,is there an ending like find out whether she did it or not
Her Story,"Someone help me! I had played this game back in the 90's. I'm serious! It was on Win 95 computers on my school. 

What I don't remenber if it's identical, or a very, very, very similiar game, because I was a teenager. But one thing for shure, this game isn't original. The guy found some very old and obscure software that no one's remenber, and clains it's all his ideas, when it's not. 

I'm working very hard to find anything on the internet, but it's hard! Someone help me!"
Her Story,I read every single comment in this comment section and every single one of them was terrible.
Her Story,How did this beat witcher 3?
Her Story,"When in doubt, type
(Spoilers)






ADMIN_RANDOM."
Her Story,IGN reviewers wear diapers.
Her Story,"great game 
at first i was like i dont care about her story i just want to find out who killed him and win the game but then while playing i actually wanted to know about her story and i didnt care about winning the game. the game doesnt tell when do you win the game. it lets you decide when you feel like you won the game when you understand her story"
Her Story,I hope this comes to ps4 looks interesting 
Her Story,I was looking at this game.. Hmm..
Her Story,"Please Help! My friend and I are in a prank war, and he has a Clown Phobia. So please send a scary clown pic to  4079526713"
Her Story,"Really loved this game, everybody should try it. It's so cheap and the quality of the story is great."
Her Story,Hey English date stamp makes more sense that American why would you put month first surely it should be in order of which is longest not just random 
Her Story,"its actually a really good game, buy it, BUY IT!"
Her Story,Ugh...IGN has so many haters...
Her Story,"""The gameplay is essentially a search engine"" 10/10 -IGN"
Her Story,"Jared Petty is the man! Compassionately kind, endlessly knowledgeable, eternally calm demeanor, and he probably played System Shock and Ultima II"
Her Story,What happened to the new Silent Hills?
Her Story,10/10 ign we got payed $
Her Story,so I have to pay $5000 for a PC just to play this game?
Her Story,*PC Games lol.*
Her Story,LIL JUJU - WIZ KHALIFA. Search that everyone!!!
Her Story,10/10 - IGN
Her Story,Don't like this
Her Story,"Like my comment
"
Her Story,creepy
Her Story,Yea 1st
Her Story,"0:44 They're called ""quotation-marks"". Jeez, make English more clunky, will'ya?
And watch yourself in the mirror wihile you're talking for practice: You rip your mouth open _extremely_ wide at the corners. It looks super weird and unattractive, not at all as awesome as you're prolly telling yourself. The fugly lipstick isn't helping either. Hard to watch. Ouch..."
Her Story,I just finished Telling Lies on xbox. I wish this was on console...may have to play it on PC.
Her Story,One of the best spoiler free review I ever seen on YouTube
Her Story,Does the game tell you when you've solved it?
Her Story,and how does it play on Switch?
Her Story,"Already watching this video, or ANY video/text about the game, is knowing too much. It's more fun going into the game knowing nothing and discovering the mechanics etc oneself."
Her Story,"I went to order this game when it was on sale for 1.50.  As I was entering my credit card information, the sale ended and it went back to 5 bucks.  Guess I'm not playing this game."
Her Story,Can you tell her not to speak like a newcaster please?
Her Story,"The game starts to suck once you realize deleting the BLANK tag on each viewed video, and then searching for BLANK will yield a result of the next five clips, sorted conveniently in chronological order. It's built right into the game and foils the entire nonlinear mechanic."
Her Story,she finishes every sentence with the same inflection....soooooo fucking annoying.
Her Story,wtf is this trash. I love telltale but this is just a movie with a cool menu
Her Story,This won the game award for best narrative???
Her Story,I gave this game a red hot go but i realise i have no chill. just gave up after 1 hour.
Her Story,Glorified Google+You Tube simulator.
Her Story,"Who says challenge can only be found in gameplay? I think Her Story challenges narratively, just as Bioshock Infinite did. And this folks, is how you innovate."
Her Story,If video games are just for fun then I'm sorry to say but we're not going to progress any further. We're better off hiding under the basement of our houses ain't we?
Her Story,"This ""game"" had a decent premise but wow does it not deliver. It's kinda like the movie Prometheus. It takes you in being intriguing and an excellent atmosphere,  then you're like omg I can't wait to see what happens. Couple hours later, omg this is gonna rule! And credits. Then you kinda look around like ""...whuuu"" you start looking under your seat, in the skittles, some old ladies purse, she yells but you yell back ""WHERE'S THE PAYOFF WOMAN!! WHAT DIDWE JUST HAPPEN!?"" And it's just another night with plot balls swelled up to the size of your regret for never getting that time back. Then people ask ya how it was and out of embarrassment you embellish on how great it was and try to leave asap. 

That's this game."
Her Story,"Is it a ""game"" though? Seemed like more of an interactive story, like some kind of mid ground between game and movie. I ""played"" it but never felt like i was playing anything - more like explored. Despite all that i do feel it was a very special and unique experience, I did get a kick out of some of the unexpected touches the game had."
Her Story,I don't buy games for my iPad but this oh boy I loved it I want part 2 this game was made for me i was hooked 2 all days I played this non stop even when I was away I wanted to get on and finish it 
Her Story,"but were are the polygons, polygons=emotions"
Her Story,"This isn't a game, it's literally just an interactive movie."
Her Story,this game just seem to be a rehash of the FMV type of games that was all the rave two decades ago
Her Story,"Since its announcements I was expecting an experience not a game but when it comes to experiences the only good one I have to go by is Device 6 and I think comparing anything to that masterpiece would make the other look awful.

I intend on getting this in a sale but I'm not sure if I'll like it, simply put, its seems like there is't enough substance r thought to anything in the game, its pretty vague but in a bad way. What makes 'experience' games good, even the most abstract and confusing ones is an interesting plot (often hidden), good riddles/puzzles (both literal and non-literal, as in working out what the end actually meant), good audio-visual design (THE most important! When you don't have 'graphics' you need smart design) and a polished experience which this game doesn't look like it has

I don't think it has the finesse or detail to be Device 6 level quality but it may surprise me, the main issue I see is that it seems the story will in the end make sense but not be a true shock because of the way its told. And while piecing together an understanding may be fun, it takes away the the feeling of being outsmarted by a game or confused and utterly shocked by the ending.

Again, this is speculation and I could love r hate it, I dunno"
Her Story,I know a lot of people wont like this game but personally when I sat down with some friends and played through it we had a lot of fun trying to figure out what was going on in the story . Also I enjoyed that it was a refreshing  and somewhat unique experience
Her Story,"I made a video about this very subject, you can watch it on my channel. It's incredibly democratic in the way that it allows you're own conclusion to be as true as you believe it to be. Kinda revolutionary experience in game narrative. Nice connection to Dark Souls here as well - definitely one of the best videos I've seen on Gamespot in a while."
Her Story,Your mom xD
Her Story,"It's awesome that this game is getting so much coverage. 

It, uh..may not be my cup of tea, but it definitely has an *interesting* concept."
Her Story,Nothing special about Her Story.
Her Story,just because its different dosnt mean it is good.. you just have to click and search for videos.. wow   its not even an interaktive game like the tell tail stuff or heavy rain or what ever
Her Story,"I play since atari days... I'm used to learning the game, I'm glad there are still devs who don't want to hold player's hand all the time. Discovering things is fun and engaging much more than pop-up fucker who tell you everything."
Her Story,"hey guys i make Music that can be used freely for gaming videos etc.
greetings :)"
Her Story,"We could definitely use more games that expect a bit more out of us, that actually respect that we can, even if not the most gracefully, work out problems for ourselves and trek towards the conclusion without the need of psychological tricks or incessant reminders and messages."
Her Story,"Nothing, its just interactive movie honestly its just finding out motives and the story"
Her Story,I'm sorry this is a very boring game. It's like watching a British episode of Law and Order.
Her Story,The way Jess explains this game makes it sound like something more than it is.
Her Story,i would rather play GTA 5
Her Story,yerrrr
Her Story,It doesn't really look like a game to me..more like interactive movie.
Her Story,First 
Minit,right now it's FREE on Epic Games thank you so much!!!
Minit,Looks pretty nifty.
Minit,"Don't EVER pay for this game, I got it in a bundle for next to nothing and it's really not worth any sort of asking price outside that."
Minit,"A piece of shit game.
Sorry, but it sucks."
Minit,This was just added to Game Pass. It looks interesting with a neat sounding concept.  I think ill give it a shot. Thanks for the info
Minit,This game is great. I rly enjoyed it my first go
Minit,"Great review, but I feel like games like that that accomplish everything they set out to do deserve a 10 or at least a 9 regardless of their tiny scope."
Minit,It's like Micro-Majora's Mask.
Minit,Missed opportunity to do this review in 60 seconds
Minit,Sounds tedious. Pass.
Minit,One Minute Hero
Minit,it is a crime that this is not on switch! dying to play it but I am gonna wait til I can SWITCH IT UP
Minit,On switch please
Minit,Great review but I was wondering what made it an 8 it sounds like a 9 score game to me at least from what was said in the review anyway :)
Minit,This or God of War ... can’t decide
Minit,Blood always reviews the games that would normally fly under my radar.
Minit,"Is this only on PC?
It looks interesting but I wish it had better visuals, I just can't look at this for long periods of time, or even short."
Minit,3 stars... dudududuuu
Minit,"Reminder: If it isn't self published, it isn't ""indie."" It's just by a small studio."
Minit,Half-Minute Hero has evolved to One-Minute Hero. Looks neat though.
Minit,The review should of been 60 seconds long.
Minit,HI Blood! Great review. This is now on my radar. Will probably grab it when it eventually hits the switch.
Minit,"4:20 long, I get it"
Minit,Poor little indie game doesn’t stand a chance against the massive GoW hype train 😔
Minit,"""I love pushing boxes.
""CHRIS Redfield.""

This gave me E3 flashbacks, to one of the weirdest Huber moments to be more specific."
Minit,Nice review. I adore this game. Should have been on Switch though!
Minit,Oh my god I just realized the main character is tomagachi
Minit,"I love the concept of this game, but the art style just isn't super appealing to me unfortunately."
Minit,God of War review prologue
Minit,arbitrary limitations and looping gameplay that has no justifiable consequence but rather only exists to pad playtime? where have i heard that before? (roguelike/lites)
Minit,That same house now goes for 3 million.
Minit,"I played this game for about an hour and a half and then I got a virus and had to wipe Windows. (Un?)fortunately I lost my save data for minit because I did not back up the files. This game was honestly super boring. I'm pretty sure I only had one or two major things left to do before I beat it, but I was very disappointed with this game."
Minit,"""Super Marao world"" 😶"
Minit,"At 1:21 there is a camera right above where the watering pot and sword go, I didn’t see this on the mobile version can someone please tell me what it is?"
Minit,This review is bizarre it's like you're judging the game for something it's not trying to be.
Minit,I got MINIT for free on the Epic Games store with zero pretense. Went into it with zero expectations and I was still disappointed.
Minit,My name 🤣🤣🤣
Minit,this a lie. 13 minit review.
Minit,"Seems like he’s describing Kindergarten, at least the time loop aspect"
Minit,"I was entirely against him until he mentioned the price and remembered I got it for free.
$10 is half of spelunky 2 and I've been playing that for months even after ""beating it"" (7th world ending not 7-99)."
Minit,good game
Minit,Fuck this game
Minit,"What I don't understand is how this game is 140 MEGS!? Hundreds of times bigger than Super Mario World. This game should be about 4k. I hate sloppy, bloated coding, so I would not download this game on principle. It's shoddy coding, IMHO. You can make huge, rich, colorful games under 140K. For this game to be 140 MEGS is just insane to me."
Minit,"Super Marah-io? Or is it spelled like Mariah Carrey, Super Marioh, Ma-rye-oh, wft?"
Minit,"Comparing Minits timer to timer in games like Stardew Valley is extremely weird, its not even comparable. I get not liking the game, but saying it doesn’t do anything interesting with timer? Completely disagree"
Minit,"i mean, its free now sooo........ ;)"
Minit,Who else is here from epic games to see how this game actually looks like
Minit,Here because its free on Epic Games
Minit,so....just a normal game except u keep dying involuntarily
Minit,Sounds like you just want to play The Outer Wilds.
Minit,Its a super great experience just more of a game  for when its on sale
Minit,"Minit sucks! you go tellem Joseph, I cant believe something so short was such a huge waste of my time, the time mechanic is just an excuse to extend an otherwise tiny game devoid of any meaningful content"
Minit,"I think you're right that the game could be a lot more and it's definitely overpriced when not on sale, but if you accept it for what it is I found it to be a ton of fun and deeply satisfying."
Minit,thats an interesting idea about the pointlessness of its time loop mechanic. does  this hold true for other games with time loops? Like what if you took the time loop out of Majora's Mask? Outer Wilds? Would it have a significant impact on the game?
Minit,"this game has a problem, the witness has a problem, and the witness is like dark souls, so minit is like dark souls"
Minit,"Whoa dude spoilers, a heads up next time would be appreciated."
Minit,"How to tell it's a satire piece, he mispronounces mario"
Minit,Rninit*
Minit,"Honestly, I feel like it got warm reception because it's got the Vlambeer dev name attached to it. It's not a bad game, but I feel like if someone besides JW made this it wouldn't have gotten so popular."
Minit,"4:15 so someone watched ""the history of the entire world i guess"" or ""the history of japan"" before making this scene."
Minit,"3:17 ""Super Maraih World""
opinion invalidated"
Minit,Super MARAJO World
Minit,"If you like time loops, you should really check out Outer Wilds. It has a really really great story and gameplay mechanics that I think are worth reviewing."
Minit,You SO missed the opportunity to make this video 13:37 long.
Minit,Oh and you definitely forgot the music! It’s great
Minit,"For me Minit had a fair price . I know it’s about €5 an hour, but I’ve paid more for God of War. Finished III in 9 hours and paid €68. This game brought something new, had humor and I liked the artstyle. It wasn’t perfect,  but very very decent. I like the review, but don’t agree with the value for money"
Minit,This game is the speedrunn
Minit,You can duck in the T-Rex game????
Minit,"I feel like if a sequel was made that implemented some of your ideas, it'd be a hell of a little game"
Minit,5:16 We were this close to greatness
Minit,Super mar I o world
Minit,"Yeah, I'd be disappointed if I paid 10 bucks for this. I got it in a bundle and loved the short time I spent with it, though."
Minit,"That snorkel guy comes up once you’ve killed enough of the guys near him, that’s what he means by “it’s safe?”"
Minit,"I like this game, but I did play it for free at ACMI in Melbourne"
Minit,Play Half-Minute Hero if you can. Really decent game.
Minit,"I don’t understand your criticism of how the plant is growing, it’s completely consistent with the rest of the game yet you seem to think it isn’t? If other people remember meeting you, it makes sense that the plant should also “remember” being watered. How is that a discrepancy?"
Minit,Pls cirique pathologic 2 yusuke-sama
Minit,"1. Buy the game
2. Play it in under two hours
3. Refund it
4. No profit, but no loss"
Minit,"How the fuck can you compare Mario to Minit if your progress is savind in those 60 seconds? If the timer runs out an a Mario level, the Goomba you jumped on doesn't stay dead does it?"
Minit,Disappointed that the review didn't reset my browser every minute.
Minit,"You know, I'm pretty sure Minit was an entry of a game jam.
That's why it feels ""incomplete""."
Minit,epic games had this game on a weekend sale  for free so if that happens then its a small fun little game otherwise too small to pay money for it
Minit,joe's streams are entertaining but man this dude gets pretty brokebrained over such tiny things like minit's core concept
Minit,"This is definitely a 2 dollar game, and even that's a stretch, there are many free games that look way more fun than this"
Minit,13-and-a-half Minit review.
Minit,Are you Canadian? If so big ups to yiu
Minit,"I, as someone generally opposed to serious speedrunning, liked it as a simple puzzle game with an emphasis on optimally routing your path."
Minit,"I got it for $5 and really loved it, it was what I expected honestly, one of my few platinums, great video as always"
Minit,"5:41 As someone who buys a significant amount of 10-20€ games, that means minit is overpriced. For 20€ you could get something like ion fury, or amid evil, or dusk, or factorio, and spend aa good amount of time in them. 

For 10€, you have terraria. I have 900 hours in that game (and like 400 from back before i bought it) orcs must die lasted me a long time too.

For 4€ I'd consider buying this"
Minit,"if you like time as a resource, why aren't you reviewing AoE2?"
Minit,I think $10 for the game is too much but on the other hand I feel like you're giving it a bad rap because of your expectations. It's hard to feel that this review was as objective as it could've been.
Minit,wont get 2 hours out of dam you must be a god at it cause i've 6 hours and i ain't done yet.
Minit,"It's a game made quickly with a small team to experiment with a fun mechanic.  Definitely a great game if you go into it with the right expectations, a fun interesting 2 hour long experience."
Minit,Did any body come down when he said super mayoworld
Minit,was shocked when i heard toronto lmao its weird hearing where you live pop up in videos  hahah
Minit,You bought this game i got it for free from epic games now go check it
Minit,i got this game for free on epic games. it has weakly free games you suld look into it!
Minit,"Well it’s free now, so how’s that for value?"
Minit,"This game seems like it would benefit a lot from being a roguelike akin to cadence of hyrule. If the map was randomly generated every run, the game would have more too it and have a reason to play the new game plus and marys mode because the game would be harder along with a new map."
Minit,"Out of all the mundane ways I've heard people say ""Mario""....
MUH RYO just dethroned them all."
Minit,Super who? Ma-rye-oh? lol
Minit,Minit is free in Epic Store next so there is no entry fee to this experiment now :D
Minit,"Boy sure hope you played recently released Outer Wilds, that explores time loop so fucking well."
Minit,The Obligatory Dark Souls Reference™ is my favourite segment. I hope to see it again in another video.
Minit,Dollars per hour is not a valid way to judge a game. 🙄🙄🙄
Minit,Can't stand time based games
Minit,So the game is bad because you misunderstood the mechanics?
Minit,Half Minute Hero <3
Minit,The toronto house price joke hurt me personally in my soul I feel you :’(
Minit,Minit is not better than good browser games
Minit,"man, time based mechanics in games but you don't even mention risk of rain. :/"
Minit,Das
Minit,4:17 Now that was EPIC
Minit,Super WHAT World?
Minit,"Even though the game only last a minute each run, I'm still surprised that the video is well under an hour long.."
Minit,Shout-out to Half-minute hero! Yay!
Minit,"Shame, I saw the art style and was very intrigued"
Minit,"Honestly, I prefer you saying Mairiah, over Mayrio"
Minit,either you're some sort of super wizard at games or you're embellishing a bit -- I remember the normal game taking me at least 5 hours.
Minit,"Third time watching this video, but I don't know if I can accept your critique after hearing you butch that name. /s

I actually saw this before I played the game, and just played it, and watched it again as I gather my thoughts on it. I think I disagree about parts, but you're right about the missed potential in the game.

It feels like they tried every take and version on the limited time mechanic, but never stuck to just one.   Where as Half Minute hero is just a brilliant game, Minit is just a short one."
Minit,Cost less than a game did of that length back in the 90's. And gave me a fun experience.
Minit,nice
Minit,Hahaha Mario Carrey
Minit,what's the game on 3:35
Minit,The art style seems to be more like the ZX Spectrum than the Game Boy.
Minit,Isn't this the Jim Sterling review? Can somebody explain why it's the same video? thanks in advance
Minit,3:17 Super MARAYO world?
Minit,mar-eye-o
Minit,I think it was pretty good and I think friends would love this
The Witness,great review
The Witness,Finally remembered the name of this game
The Witness,One of the most unique and memorable games I’ve ever played. Loved every second of it.
The Witness,we have seen enough
The Witness,Dunkey brought me here
The Witness,Of course a boring and repetetive game got a perfect score lol
The Witness,*tangible*
The Witness,Amazing game
The Witness,"This game really is a masterpiece, the creators are genius"
The Witness,Hardest puzzle game ever
The Witness,Bro it’s so nice watching such a short video after watching a 45 minute one 🤣
The Witness,too bad the game has one of the most absurd and shitiest solutions in any game ever. and the dot is missing between 1 and 0
The Witness,Who came here after getting free on store to see it's worth it
The Witness,Such an underrated gem!
The Witness,Seems like a Myst ripoff to me.
The Witness,Anyone here from Play at Home 2021
The Witness,Looks like a very lonely game...
The Witness,Perfect 10! Wow!!! How many games in history...? Indies are the best!!!
The Witness,"Every one of Jonathan Blows games messes with a core construct of game design:
Braid: Time
The Witness: Perspective
New Subokan Game: Location & Movement
Untitled 20 Year Long Game: Story & Structure"
The Witness,Sony said Stay at home and Play this
The Witness,And it's  now free with Play at home..lol
The Witness,I’m here watching this video while downloading it from the Play at Home as a free game.
The Witness,ayy im just here cause its bout to go free on ps in few hours
The Witness,Boring
The Witness,Gonna play this among HZD and Subnautica!
The Witness,Who’s here after it was announced free on PlayStation
The Witness,"Whose here after knowing The Witness will be free as part of Play at Home Initiative. Coming this spring, starting March 25— 10 games will drop as free, so you may wanna check that out."
The Witness,Play at home
The Witness,Who is here for the Stay At Home games 🕹👍👍
The Witness,Are you here because of play at home?
The Witness,Play at home brought me here
The Witness,tbh it sounds utterly boring if all you do is drawing lines on panels to solve puzzles..
The Witness,"Reading through recent comments... 

Anyone who uses the words ""overrated"" or ""pretentious"" has a looooong way to grow as a critic."
The Witness,"yeahhh...i just beat the game, It was a rigid mess movement and physics-wise. It felt very unpolished, too short 3-4 ish hours, and for me the puzzels were really inconsistent. 2 of them were hard because there was no introduction to the dynamics required to solve them. and the rest of the entire game was absurdly easy. The story was cute, but honestly with so many great games in this genre, just skip this and play Superliminal / The Talos Principal / Manifold Garden / The Turing Test / Portal / Portal 2 / The Witness / Antichamber. This one was really not worth it."
The Witness,This game BLOWs
The Witness,"Sounds overrated. It's a string of puzzles on a puppet island. Got close to fed up 40 mins in.

And wtf was this line in the review: ""Its puzzles are solvable."" Wow, a puzzle game has solvable puzzles... You might want to rethink that statement."
The Witness,even Pitchfork has a better catalogue of 10/10 albums than IGN
The Witness,"This game is kinda boring though, literally the same puzzle over and over again"
The Witness,I wish this game would hurry up and go on sale. Looks amazing but not worth the current price they're asking for on the PlayStation Store.
The Witness,Great review. Agree with every word. I am now introducing my daughter to it and she LOVES it too :)
The Witness,Any PSVR updates?
The Witness,This game is proof that Steam users will buy absolutely anything
The Witness,Sometimes the most entertaining experiences can be found in the most simplest games. No saving the universe from big baddies. No high stakes. Just a calm and relaxing game.
The Witness,QDOS
The Witness,Kudos -- 444 Gematria -- 🗽
The Witness,This review sounds like a high school essay.
The Witness,"ok imma be honest, i rage deleted the game because i could solve the first riddles, but after seeing this vid i ve decided to try again."
The Witness,Can i play this on 4 gb ram if i keep graphics at minimum
The Witness,One of the worst games ever made.
The Witness,It got so hard in like 3 hours that i wanted to kill myself.
The Witness,“Fair and solvable” WTF ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THERES NOT TUTORIAL FOR 90% OF THE SYMBOLS YOU JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OTU ON YOUR OWN!
The Witness,"tried it and gave up, too hard and boring"
The Witness,Boring
The Witness,"Very Original


2 Thumbs Up"
The Witness,Game is great but scenery just gives me headache.
The Witness,"While I agree the game is amazing, I don't agree at all that it's flawless. Just as an example, there's a puzzle in the marsh (which is fairly early game) that stumped me for two reasons: 1. there was a bug that misled me from understanding the rule and 2. the game did not provide enough tutorial puzzles to reasonably allow someone to understand the puzzle. The first reason is enough to show that this game is not flawless, while the second reason can be backed by the countless others who were stuck on the puzzle, some for hours.


While the reviewer might not have encountered any bugs, I don't think she gave the occasional unfairness of the early puzzles the criticism they deserved, probably because anytime someone says something is too hard, they are immediately met with ""git gud""."
The Witness,"The game itself aside, this is a wonderful review."
The Witness,"I find it hard to be interested in something when the reviewer praising it uses so many words, but ultimately says so little."
The Witness,How can an entire review go without naming a platform?  Or did I miss it?
The Witness,Is this VR?
The Witness,I can't play this for longer than 10 minutes without getting terrible motion sickness :(  it's a problem for many if you google it
The Witness,Basically it's impossible to complete without looking up a guide.
The Witness,"Wait what, this actually got a 10/10 score from IGN?"
The Witness,This is no 10
The Witness,Its a really cool game.
The Witness,The island is looking astonishing😍
The Witness,someone grabbed a thesaurus for this review.
The Witness,Here after it is temporarily free on epic launcher
The Witness,Epic Games sale anyone?
The Witness,"damn, a 10"
The Witness,Who is here after epic games do it free?
The Witness,"Mmmmmm, Im going to say IGN is really stretching this review. IMO The puzzles got really boring, they were waaaaaay too repetitive. I am a huge Myst fan. Those were actually rewarding and original puzzles that made you want to come back for more. This game... not so much. ""Oh its the same puzzle as that one over there but inverted...""
Perhaps for some people, just not for me."
The Witness,Epic games store brought me here
The Witness,"a 10??? ya gotta be kiddin me ign.  i'm trying it right now cuz it's free on the Epic Games store, but this is at the most only a 3, there's only one kind of gameplay mechanic how could it be a 10???  no wonder most people think you're trash and unreliable nowadays, not trying to be mean."
The Witness,wow the first video of IGN with a clean 10! are you sure???? it sounds like you personally got too hyped about it
The Witness,This game makes my head hurt.
The Witness,Its free why not
The Witness,Epic brought me here.!
The Witness,Who's here because it's free on Epic Store ?
The Witness,Free for PS4 plus by the way
The Witness,what???
The Witness,Very well written review.
The Witness,Soon it will be free on epic games
The Witness,who is here because it will be free on epic store :D
The Witness,I hated this game. You need a degree in quantum physics to solve most of the puzzles. All you do is walk around from one hard puzzle to the other with no hints whatsoever
The Witness,10???? really?
The Witness,She sounds hawt
The Witness,So it's a better version of Myst in 2018 ?
The Witness,Nah
The Witness,*PS Plus brought me here*
The Witness,Lol
The Witness,Boring
The Witness,Modern age Myst
The Witness,I did the secret sun ending first time playing damn it 😡
The Witness,Can anyone help me iv done 2 playthroughs of this game the man sitting on the ground with the puzzle and the puzzle doesn't work! !!!!
The Witness,"40-50+h and almost 100 for 100%? XD took me 3 days of on and off playing it, totaling roughly 20h to plat..."
The Witness,"The game itself is really beautiful, the puzzles, easy to insane. But it got boring really quickly."
The Witness,It deserves a 10
The Witness,+1 platinum then
The Witness,looks trash
The Witness,"Take a look at the first minute of this video, this segment right here tells you everything you need to know about how *bad* this ""critic"" is. Let me explain my reasoning here.

Wrong assumptions. You assume the game wants you to ""cheat"", is that true? or do you just need that to be true in order for your points to make any sense? It is a game about solving puzzles, if you don't like puzzles, the game is not for you, the puzzles are meant to require you to exert your mental capabilities, which includes observation, memorization, differentiating pitch in sounds, AND visualization (not paint), this isn't to say that it is a ""sin"" to open up paint, I don't think anyone is saying that other than the voices in your head, but it is certainly not intended that you remove half the fun of the puzzles in a puzzle game. To be able to reach either of the game's endings you NEED to go through timed puzzles, this is enough to completely shut down your idea that the game wants you to ""cheat"" on every puzzle, therefore invalidating 90% of your video, where you pretend to understand what the witness is about. 

This is a game about puzzles, pretty hard puzzles at that, you don't like puzzles, don't play the game, it's that easy. But OK, you decided to play the game anyways, and you didn't like it, that's fine! You are allowed to hate the game, but do not pretend to understand it and then attempt to explain it to your audience.

Finally, you do have a couple good points, particularly, the game lacks accessibility options, this was Jonblow's decision, and frankly, I think it was a mistake, even something like colorblindness is not exactly rare,"
The Witness,"I completely understand e respect the reasons why you dont like it, but it will always be one of my favorite games of all times"
The Witness,"My feelings on the Witnessed are mixed. The puzzles are brilliant, although some are a bit tedious and the sound puzzles I still don't understand. The endings were lame, and at the end I felt like I was cheated."
The Witness,"i don't think your arguments are very good....
but then again you had to make content right?"
The Witness,"Dude is so mad at the game, because he couldn't get pass the tutorial puzzles 😂
Also getting mad at an obvious puzzle game, because  it has puzzles is also hilarious 😂"
The Witness,"I think it’s completely fine that you didn’t enjoy The Witness, but I disagree with almost every thing you consider flawed about the game. I think you fundamentally don’t understand that it’s a game that attempts to achieve an unfamiliar experience for a video game, and uses the bare interactive elements of a typical video game to explore so much. Boiling down the “meaning” of the game into just the tetris effect with dots and lines is frankly quite narrow minded considering that there’s clearly so much more through the recordings and secret videos, which I’m not even sure if you’re aware of. You say that good puzzle games give you a toolkit, which is exactly what the witness does with all the different types of symbols and puzzle layouts, I feel that you’re upset because the game never explicitly tells you how concepts work. The gameplay is slow, which is a fair criticism until you realize that almost every slow moving platform or what has a puzzle linked to it, and it moving too fast would be pretty annoying. I think what a lot of people unfortunately expect with the witness is a game where progress is measurable, and you go in with a clear objective, which the witness just isn’t; it’s an enigmatic, slow, thought provoking experience that is more about discovery than actual gameplay. It’s not a game you play for entertainment sake, but more because you find it really engaging on a conceptual level. Again, it’s fine that you don’t like the witness, but you’re completely out of line to say that it’s straight up a bad puzzle game."
The Witness,"Interesting perspective, I basically don't agree with any of your points, except that the game is inaccessible due to the nature of some puzzles.

It didn't even occur to me to use tools outside of the game at any point. You can just use your head and in most cases taking notes is pointless because all of the information is small and directly in front of you.

Learning the rules of each kind of symbol is just the setup. It's enjoyable too, but the real challenge is in exploring the solution space. To me a good puzzle game is one that is consistently capable of making you feel that you've explored every possible avenue of search but yet are still missing the solution. The witness consistently does this.

Every single puzzle in every game can be mathematically reduced so this point makes no sense.

The witness is also very varied despite everything being just drawing lines. You could say the game trolls you by throwing away a couple of important rules in the very final (and arguably optional) part of the game, but that doesn't really change the quality of the rest.

To me it just sounds like you don't like this puzzle format. Perhaps because unlike baba is you or other puzzle games, these line puzzles are inherently stateless: you don't need to infer what's going to happen after a certain action is taken, you only need to care what line can satisfy each rule.

Personally I'm tempted to say I might prefer the witness over baba is you because the search space is much more focused."
The Witness,this vid sucks Sry M8
The Witness,"Do you have ADHD by any chance?
This game is painfully bad. I like it, it's kinda cool, but not like a game, like probably a piece of modern art, that you see in the museum. Kinda cool to look at once, would not want to have it in your house though."
The Witness,"I just finished the game and felt more of a relief that it was over. Glad to hear I'm not the only one who found the puzzles tedious and laborious. I had very few ""aha!"" moments which is the cornerstone of any good puzzle game in my opinion."
The Witness,@6:20 I don't know If I'm just weird but well. I solved these mazes so I didn't have to go back. I just remembered and retraced my steps at the top. I think you did a little bit of disservice to yourself by overusing screenshots and paint
The Witness,"A good rule to go by is that any time your argument requires you to assume the death of the author, you're wrong."
The Witness,"6:10 I took the final maze puzzle as an invitation to test my memory, and to my surprise I actually got it right in one or two tries.

I think this is generally true of the game: If you think it's telling you to do something tedious, you can try the thing that ISN'T tedious. This is obvious with the panels that turn off when a mistake is made, but there's several other examples. For instance, you can do the final mirror puzzles by finding a viewpoint where both versions of a puzzle are visible. And in the desert temple, you should be figuring out where light will reflect so that you don't have to move the water repeatedly. And in the treehouse area, the game actually forces you to figure out an efficient path.)

...that said, it arguably wasn't executed very well. I agree the game was often tedious in practice, since it wasn't clear when to use what methods. It's definitely fair to call it a bad game (although it's one of my favorites)."
The Witness,"Have you considered that the game is for people that enjoy mazes, and maybe you don't?"
The Witness,Speaking about the problems of The Witness – have you played The Looker?
The Witness,if you think the game is just about solving the puzzles you missed the whole point of the game.
The Witness,I played the game together with a friend via discord screensharing and found that it removed alot of the tedium you mentioned. We could look at 2 perspectives at the same time. Figured out the semantics together. Could look at high and low water at the same time etc. I found the game to be really fun playing like this.
The Witness,"The game has DEVASTATING flaws in the accessibility department that kinda cripple it for real, but none of your other points really stuck with me. 

  I was gonna write a whole lot of stuff and go down point by point but i think i found the main thing i found lacking in your review.
  As we all know ""The Witness"" is about observation. It's in the name, and the game is practically screaming it at you the whole way. The game doesn't give you tools to solve dilemmas with, all the rules come from _things_ in _places_, and the dilemmas are about discovering ways these things can interact to create correct paths, or just... looking at the things carefully.
  The big thing that made me enjoy the game a lot that i think didn't work out in your playthrough is I didn't stop at looking around in search of a solution (even though i spend a whole lot of time on that). No, the game isn't just asking me to look for the solution in the environment, it's asking me LOOK AT THE ENVIRONMENT. 
  The ""environmental puzzles"" (which how the fuck do you go through the entire game and only find 4 of those) aren't ""a thing that you can do while prancing around trying to find the actual gameplay"", they are THE ENDGAME. Yeah the game has an ""ending"" sequence after you do the whole ""figuring out"" but it's quite obvious even if you didn't watch the movies under the mill that it's telling you to go see what's out there. The game did such a good job at making me want to look around that sometimes when i needed to go somewhere, i'd just click to walk ON NORMAL SPEED to be able to look around while the character gets to where i wanted to go (yes, click to walk is better. we know they didn't make it for ""accessibility"" and yes it's a better fit).
  Saying the witness is a bad game because the puzzles are badly designed and the game is slow is like saying that undertale is a bad game because the rpg mechanics don't lead to decisions and the bullet hell is too easy"
The Witness,"I don't think I can confidently say the witness is ""good"" or ""bad"". It's got some great ideas, the concept of trying to understand what the puzzle are even about takes different mental ressources from actually solving them, I think overlooking the obtuseness as a waste of time is not trying to engage with the game concept. The witness is about the scientific method, testing hypothesis to try and figure out the rules of a confusing world. 

Basically it's the misanthropic version of outer wilds.
Cause yeah the game also just feels like it was made by someone who loathed anyone who'd want to play it, it's not a great feeling, and the accessibility issues for me push that from a front the game could have had to clearly what the game feels like. I know I wasn't able to solve any of the sound based puzzles (except the very early ones) even knowing what I had to do. I'm not deaf, though I learned way after playing the witness that I most likely have auditory processing disorder so looking back it's most likely that. 

But yeah, having to look up the solution cause you're physically unable to solve a puzzle is not a great feeling and it also makes it more likely to get frustrated quicker with the other puzzles. I know once I started looking the solution for sound based puzzles my trust in the game was kinda shattered and I felt less inclined to believe there was a solution I could work out even when there was so I ended up being more lenient with looking things up. The author probably wanted so much that some people experience his vision in the purest form that he basically thought that anyone else can fuck off.

But despite all this I still think it's full of good ideas and I honestly don't really mind that it's ""wasting my time"". I find it kinda helpful actually, I have ADHD so these long waiting moment are kinda torture but they also help me remind my brain to chill the fuck out. While it's inconveniences can be downright hostile at time I'm also someone who struggles to not use conveniences even when they lessen the experience. For exemple the boat rides could have had an optional teleport but environnemental puzzles aside it'd make it more likely that you just give up on a puzzle quickly and zip around all the areas instead of persevering in the one you're currently in.
Sometimes inconvenience can be good and too much convenience can make it hard to settle in with some of the game's features. Like how fast travel and mini maps with quest objectives in open world games tend to make it less likely you familiarize yourself with the world. (seriously, try playing skyrim without fast travel, it can be tedious as fuck at times but you also get a very different appreciation for the environnement layout, the small hidden things everywhere, the random events etc. It's a completely different experience).
I think the witness pushes that towards hostily and it doesn't need to be such a dick all the time but going all out ""it's bad"" without trying to engage with what it's trying to do isn't better than going ""it's amazing"" and overlooking the accessibility issues in my opinion."
The Witness,"i get the point of the game, how it's meant to be an art piece or a statement or something, but man i can't look past how this game is just... not enjoyable, i'd rather play any other puzzle game"
The Witness,The Witness gives me serious horror vibes and I have no idea why; no one else has ever mentioned anything close to that but the world is so quiet and terrifying. I had to stop playing at times.
The Witness,"I love this vid, please do more like this! Also yeah The Witness doesn't respect its players' anything."
The Witness,6:04 you had the solution just by looking at the garden labyrinth from where you are standing. But your pov is understood
The Witness,What I haven’t yet managed to figure out is how much the developers would need to pay me to play (!?) a game like this.
The Witness,"The thing is - the parts that you call needless tedium and time-wasting is the part that I consider the actual puzzles.

In other words, yes, I found going down, figuring out how to drain the water, where to look, and then trying to remember the solution interesting.
I didn’t copy the invisible line to photoshop, and when I finally managed to solve it I felt really proud of myself.
I went up and down the elevator a dozen times, writing down the color changes trying to figure out how they lined up.

And while I can understand the complaints being made, it also feels a bit like someone saying “this book of brainteasers is really easy if you look at the answers in the back.”  I don’t think you or the people who agree with you are wrong, per se.  I certainly don’t think using Photoshop is “cheating” I just think you either enjoy different kinds of puzzles or look at what the actual puzzle is differently.  To me, the game felt a lot like when I was learning to program - I thought I understood how something worked, started making stuff on that assumption, then it turned out I was way off base and had to rethink my initial assumptions.  And when I finally got everything perfect, I was super proud of myself.

The one point that stuck with me in the lead-up to The Witness was Blow saying that he wanted the puzzles to require the player to interact with the island - yes, you COULD solve them 1 by 1 in a book, but they were supposed to compliment the island and vice versa, and I think he got that part right.

As far as the ridiculous hyperbole of game reviewers, that’s a whole other bundle of stupidity.  But I feel like the Witness is one of the few games that made me genuinely look at the world around me a little differently, rather than always taking everything I see at face value, sometimes it’s worth a second look to see what else might be hiding in plain sight."
The Witness,"I felt exasperated and exhausted playing the witness. I groaned when I realized I had to pay attention to the noise of the gravel, and I was disappointed when I discovered the birds in the woods were part of a puzzle instead of making a living island."
The Witness,"This is an old video, so it might be fixed already, but you should definitely invest in a pop filter."
The Witness,"I enjoyed most of the game (including the parts where I have to take notes), until the ending which disappointed me a lot. I was expecting some kind of payoff other than just flying around the map. Like, some explanation to what happened. It's as if all that effort was for nothing. Maybe I was spoiled by games like Tunic and Outer Wilds both of which I played before The Witness."
The Witness,"I gave the witness a try a while back, but never finished it and I feel like this video perfectly articulates why. While the start of the game was pretty straight forward, I eventually found myself constantly confonting puzzles that I had no idea where to start with. I very frequently felt like i'd missed something elsewhere, which I found overwhelming and frustrating, and it very quickly became a game of me hunting for puzzles that I actually knew how to slove, leaving for later when I couldn't figure out a puzzles mechanic."
The Witness,"I dont remember whose video-analysis it was, but it pretty much described the game as very elaborate troll, with forming cult circlejerk following of people liking their own farts too much."
The Witness,it's ok to be wrong
The Witness,"The thing about The Witness is that it mostly appeals to people who thinks imagistically over people who think conceptually. As someone who thinks and reasons with mental images, this is the type of game that was taylor-made for me, the same way I can understand why it can get tedious to more verbally-minded people. Also, I don't think any point about the game being slow at points is valid considering this isa game that revolves around the idea of mindfulness, of letting yourself get immersed in the tiny things of this gift-to-the-senses hand crafted virtual island."
The Witness,"noone told me that using tools is cheating :D
i used a math block like when you draw maps for yourself in other older games"
The Witness,I completely disagree!  I think it is the best game I have ever played on a PC.
The Witness,"The gameplay reminds me of really old subversive flash puzzle games or html ARG games around about 2003, which were all about the obfuscation and breaking and rebuilding your assumptions about the rules of the game, rather than a more traditional puzzle. So it's more like another genre entirely, but unlike those old games the Witness plays very smoothly and is very pretty and in every way seems like a normal polished puzzle game. Those old games seemed glitchy and crunchy in their presentation so you immediately knew you were wandering into a chaotic and punishing world."
The Witness,"you should play the looker, is a parody on he witness, is amazing"
The Witness,"The Witness is a terrible game and its designer is an arrogant hack. I'm honestly surprised you didn't talk about the ""hold left click for 45mins"" puzzle. The game has a decent base mechanic and iterates on it very well for the initial ""aha"" moment you get when you figure out a mechanic (like the glare on the monitors) but then it just wastes your time doing all the things you mentioned in this video. It really upsets me that so many people this game is genious, honestly."
The Witness,i dunno man its mostly a pretty good game and thats not a really good video
The Witness,"""Given the opportunity, players will optimize the fun out of a game.""
That quote is the first thing I thought of while watching this video. I am so glad I didn't think of using paint to solve the puzzles. The game was so much fun without it."
The Witness,"Whenever I see a negative review of the witness, I sit through it and wait to hear what they think of the “environmental” puzzles.  The fact that you’ve spotted and solved four (lol) just tells me that you and I were playing intrinsically different games.  The witness is a lot like frog fractions, you can spend the game doing what it is asking you to do on the surface and be bored to tears.  For instance I saw and solved my first “env” puzzle ten seconds in when I realized I was standing on a dot.  And no other game puzzles have made so much fun out of a slow boat ride.  The sense of open discovery, mixed with tightly constrained panel puzzles is what makes the witness a unique experience.  

In the same way that my friends had to tell me to go back and play through the drudgery of dark souls, go back and play the witness with fresh eyes.  You did it wrong."
The Witness,"After writing this it seems like it starts out harsh but it's not intended to be and I like the video. Hopefully you actually read this because I think you might actually be interested. 

I think your point about the game wasting your time is really poorly made by using the water draining as an example. One of the puzzles requires you to see it's reflection in the water when the water is draining or filling, not just at the top and bottom. Making the water drain and fill faster would make the puzzle harder to complete once you figure out the solution, which is what it sounded like you disliked about the game just minutes before talking about this. 

You even show that the solution requires seeing the puzzle as the water drains and fills but don't mention that the slow speed makes figuring out and also solving the puzzle easier. Really the speed of the water is a hint. It frustrates you and you wonder ""why is this going so slow, I have to keep raising and lowering it and I just want it done!"" but if you actually think about why it's going so slow you realize that there's actually a reason. 

The Witness fits your definition of a puzzle game too and one of the largest tools in your tool box is perception. For example, you did not perceive that each of the maze puzzles is just the hedge maze that you're in and from the top of the tower that you can just look down and see the aerial view of each one and solve it that way. 

Though, I'll admit that the one that you need to initial solve by listening to your foot step sounds as you walk through can't be re-solved this way so either remember, guess or re-check. This is a valid point of criticism and I think would be a far better example to use for how the game can waste  your time. 

I do like the video though and I agree that using Paint or a pen and paper is totally fine and within the intended scope of the game. At the same time that I think use of outside tools is within the scope of the game, I think it's REALLY in scope and is part of the challenge. Your early reliance on those outside tools made later puzzles harder because it changed your perception of the game as a whole which makes changing perception based on puzzles even harder because you've added a completely new layer to it that's completely outside the control of the game to influence.

I don't expect you to change your opinion of the game and I'm not at all trying to but I think you'll be able to see what I'm saying here and at least be able to better appreciate why other people do like it and why it isn't necessarily a ""bad game"" and rather it's just not for you."
The Witness,"shoutout to The Looker, a free 6 years-late parody of The Witness that inexplicably manages to be genuinely funny and good."
The Witness,"I feel the same. I finished the witness, but it hardly felt satisfying. Knowing the fundamental rules of the puzzle but not having enough information to solve it due to... not positioning your character in the environment right? Or forgetting the 'invisible' cursor's position? Or some other design contrivance? More frustrating than it was rewarding for me."
The Witness,"Like many of the recent comments here, I saw your channel recommended recently, and was curious as to what your take on The Witness actually was.

To add to what your video mentioned: The accessibility issues are in my opinion one of the worst things about a game that I otherwise do love. I've read before that apparently this was a discussion in the game's production, and that Blow thought that it was worth having the game exist with the issues, rather than remove the puzzles that were problematic (and presumably adding accessibility options he considered to be too much of a deviance from the game's ""vision""). I keep expecting someone to create a patch for the game that adds options such as Color-blind mode and Captions, and am somewhat amazed that it hasn't happened yet.

Some stuff that I think you overlooked (possibly because you were already turned off from the game):
- The ""Solve puzzles from outside the game"" is definitely an intended experience. The game has a built-in Screenshot button listed in the options, and you can then open a folder with the images. I do think that the game would have been improved if they had included an in-game method of making notes though.
- The ""slowness"" that many people complain about, which is usually what is considered a waste of people's time, is almost always telling that someone didn't get far into the Environment / Secret puzzles. This is what many of the biggest fast of the game actually loved about it, and for many people, there's a big ""reveal"" feeling and excitement as they seek out the hidden puzzles, and discover that every ""slow"" area feels almost too fast as you are trying to solve the puzzle.

Overall, I think that the game is one of the best ""knowledge-vania"" games to-date, but I also believe that being one of the first to do what it's doing, it has a lot of flaws that other future games can learn from. If you haven't played it, I highly recommend that you check out Taiji, which was made by a different developer as a ""spiritual successor"" to The Witness, and focuses in a lot more of the ""good"" of the game, while also trying to avoid the ""bad"". 

Thank you for the video!"
The Witness,"If you want puzzles not in a video game I recommend sudoku and sudoku variants. I kinda scoffed at them for the longest time, but there's a lot of creativity and varied difficulties for everyone. Cracking the cryptic is a good channel to watch to check it out.

I say bc watching this vid made me want to go do more sudoku instead."
The Witness,I think it’s even worse than what you say. And the secret ending with the video is one of the most embarrassing things I’ve seen in a game.
The Witness,"I played a couple of hours of The Witness and found it boring and tedious, so you have my agreement"
The Witness,"I have a better complain a phrased faster than a video essay that applies to many puzzle games. I am a computer scientist in training. I know the exact method to find the way to solve the entire game. That makes it boring as hell. Yeah yeah the game is atmospheric and nice to look at but the good parts are so little and far between and literally feels like work to me. 

I fall for it due to video game essayist and the fact that it looks pretty. However in the time it takes to download you can finish portal which is infinitely better and a funner experience. Maybe the fact that the puzzles are so similar is the problem."
The Witness,"I thought you might be going somewhere in the first half of the video, but then it turned out that you really were just complaining that a puzzle game encouraged you to take notes outside of it
I then figured, ""no, that can't be it, surely there's more to this"", and then you listed off puzzle games you thought were good and it was entirely of the arcade-style variety where you're given a screen with a concrete visually represented mechanical challenge to overcome, nothing even vaguely approaching environmental puzzle design that you'd find in non-arcade puzzles
Really weird take, ""Harry - He/Him"" (if that even is your real name)"
The Witness,"@VideoGamesAreBad You say they are wasting your time. But you are missing a part of the game. The raising/lowering the water mechanism does not only serve this purpose alone. And for that I think the ""slow"" speed is kind of helpful."
The Witness,"I played a solid 10hrs of The Witness and was very torn on how I felt. On one hand having to use a notepad with a game is something I really enjoy but with some puzzles the rules just didn't with me at all (especially the bird song ones).

 However many of the games that feel like tangentially inspired The Witness have gone on to become some of my favourites: The Pedestrian and The Outer Wilds. They're all similar in that progress comes from learning rules or information about the world and using that to progress as opposed to getting stronger etc"
The Witness,"I talked with a friend a few weeks ago about the witness and a lot of complaints where similar to yours. All I can say is, you just don't get it. How slowly machines and water moves in the game is all intentionally this way. If you use the boat and switch to the fastest speed it makes unbelivable annoying sound. And also all the reviews straight lying about how the game respects your time and so on are on purpose. This game is a bitch and nothing is for free you have to solve it on your own but because of this it is more satisfying if you were finally able to conquer this island.
This game is proof video games can be art.
My friend wasn't able to understand what I said and he made fun of pixel art and retro games, so he is obviously retarded and I don't talk to him any more."
The Witness,"it's interesting seeing this video after your case of the golden idol one, since i think that one has given me the tools to express why i somewhat disagree with you. the witness may not be a great puzzle game, but i don't think it is one. i consider it to be more of an active observation game, and that's where it excels.

the environmental puzzles for me were the meat of the game, almost as if the panel puzzles were just... misdirection. you do panel puzzles only so that when you can spot a circle in the surroundings without being told it's there. and this progression doesn't end there. there are interesting things hidden in the environment that aren't line puzzles to be solved, they're just there to be noticed.

i'll spoil a few of these now, and i'm marking them as a spoiler since it's an aspect of the game you omitted in the video. there are some tree roots hanging from a rock arch that, in the reflection in the water underneath, look like a pair of koi fish circling each other. there is a tree that's filled with faces, if you just look at the branches long enough. the monumental statue reaching into the sky has a counterpart that, if observed from the right angle, it's reaching towards. the lake in the middle of the island is a functional map thereof.

that for me is the point of the witness. it's not ""the game escaped into the real world because now when i see a circle and a line i think 'hehe, witness puzzle'"". it's paying more attention to the world around you and considering links and patterns in it. the puzzles are only there so that you can break out of them. (and the puzzles that are confined to the panel can be pretty good as you noticed. the swamp and the treetops are both pretty good examples of communicating a ruleset without any words)

also john blow is a smart man who thinks he's way smarter than he is, and that his smarts apply to many more subjects than they do, which is the most annoying and obnoxious thing anyone can be. but that's neither here nor there ;)"
The Witness,"""The Looker is The Witness without its worst part, Jonathan Blow"" -steam review"
The Witness,"I find it crazy to think using mspaint is ""cheating."" Loved the Witness, but you do bring up many good points. Blow for sure was up his arts when he conceptualized this game. What really shines in the game is the mystery outside the panel puzzles. I find though that all too often the best stuff is not gotten to because there is way too much crap to wade through first. Some of the best puzzles are in a place that requires most puzzles to be done and even then is very obscure. If there is one thing you hit dead on, it's that this game is obfuscation. Blow said that he's ok with it being inaccessible too since ""it's part of the art"", which is a pretty awful standpoint. I love the game, but I always have to put a big asterisk on that statement since, by all accounts, this game is kinda shit (especially the mountain)."
The Witness,"Here from the Adam Millard video. Yep, agreed with him. You're wrong. :P 

I mean, you can't really be wrong on an opinion, so there's that. And you do make some good points. 

Unlike many (most?) video games, The Witness supports a surprisingly large number of readings. It's not clear what the game is about, so there's a number of arguments that can be made and adequately defended on this. And, of course, depending on what you interpret a work to be about, this is going to inform how good you think it its. If Super Mario Kart supported a reading that it's about meritocracy, you could conclude from that reading that it is a bad game. 

Where I think you're ""wrong"" (again, not literally) is in that you didn't mention a few key points that, in my opinion, are integral to an informed and complete reading of The Witness. Either you didn't even experienced them, or you did and didn't think they were important to mention — in any case, this represents a flaw in your reading. 

The Witness is not an easy game to talk about."
The Witness,"I rarily used any tools outside of game, I believe I did it only in the color puzzle
I really enjoyed trying to work with just my mind"
The Witness,"maybe i am just too old school, but it never occurred to me to use PS. i used pen and paper and had a ton of fun with the puzzles :)
much like with the first dark souls, i wish i could be boinked on the head and forget ever having played the game so i could get another blind playthrough.
i also liked 'opus magnum' (perhaps the most accessible zachtronics game) a lot, but that game is more about optimising a setup for different parameters and i didn't get the same sense of discovery i did from the witness."
The Witness,I came here from another video recommending your channel. They said you were wrong about the witness. *I WAS LIED TO BY THEM!* I stopped playing the game when I had to do my Nth (it was probably approaching double-digits) minuteS-long reset of a puzzle. I knew what to do. I knew how to do it. The game was just fighting me and wasting my damn time. And so I stopped giving it my time.
The Witness,Facinating how our gameplay differed. I can think of only one puzzle (in the tetris part) where i needed a piece of paper. All the other puzzles i didnt need one.
The Witness,How did you do a video about the game being tedious and not respecting time without mentioning that stupid environmental puzzle in the room that plays videos? (But I 100% agree with your take. You did a much better job articulating it than I ever had been able to before.)
The Witness,"I love the witness, I actually replay it regularly. It's the only puzzle game I legitimately really enjoy replaying start to finish (except the light-reflecting puzzles and the music puzzles, those can mostly fuck off).
My favorite part is that it feels like a metroidvania, but instead of the in-game character gaining new abilities, *I* the player gained the new abilities. And upon restarting the game, I have all the abilities still! New game+! I've still not found every puzzle in the game, and I don't really intend to. I like stumbling upon new ones every time I replay."
The Witness,"Spoilers for the game, the reason it takes so long to move things in the game is because there are hidden puzzles that change and grow as they move. Is that engaging? Up to you. Furthermore, surprised you didn't mention the best part of the game: the hidden puzzles throughout the island."
The Witness,"I'm somewhat baffled by this as...It was all very solvable in your head. I know some may need it for a specific section here or there, but that's about it.   Pen and paper or photoshop are not at all required.  

Agree the video should get a million views tho."
The Witness,"For me, the game was terribly boring. The one with the birds singing was just painful for me. Look around, try different things, realize you've got to match the singing... oh that's clever! Now, I'm quite bad at noticing if the tones go up or down, so I needed several listenings for each note. And there are like half a dozen musical puzzles, all next to each other. So, after figuring out the solution to the puzzle, I got to spent like 20 or 30 mins just matching the notes. That's just tedious.

And the rest of the game is just like that. The desert temple with its water and the musical puzzles are only two of many many possible examples."
The Witness,"Nothing about this video is wrong, but it’s a very long-winded way of saying “I don’t enjoy puzzles.” Every day millions of people do puzzles that are busy work and time wasting. That’s kind of what puzzles are. It’s ok not to like them, but it doesn’t make them bad."
The Witness,"I know it's an old video, but still.
Saying solving puzzles in The Witness is ""just too tedious"" and the game ""expects"" you to use pen and paper, is like saying that Celeste is too tedious and it expects you to use save states. Like saying that in Celeste you have already *seen* the level and *know* what buttons and in which order you need to press to complete it, but it's just *too tedious* and *too much work* to train your muscle memory to the point when you can actually execute the sequence of inputs needed for the level completion.
You are completely missing the point of the fun aspect of the game, and it seems that Witness is just not your kind of game, or you have approached it with the ""wrong"" mindset."
The Witness,"I've used photoshop on some of the much later puzzles, but most of them I just mentally visualized and solved it that way, which is why I found them super fun. I can see how if you're someone who struggles with that, the Witness will not be very fun."
The Witness,"I don’t know, taking notes and drawing clues used to be normal. It makes me feel a bit like Myst, the first Myst, anyway, which to me also always felt like the puzzles existed for the sake of being puzzles. (It even had inaccessible sound clues!)
To be fair, it’s from 1993.

I personally want to like The Witness but it gives me terrible motion sickness."
The Witness,"Totally liked this game! Also think cheating is optional and not the expectation of the game as pointed out in this video. Sure, it must be dull to go through the game if all u do is cheat, but I think mostly there was an 'in-game' solution to be found if u just pay attention. Sometimes just so obnoxious of a solution, that the hassle wasn't worth it and I'd walkthrough it. But definitely it was there to be found.

All in all, as many have pointed out, I think it is a game with a surprising amount of depth underneath a fairly simpistic surface."
The Witness,Having to listen to someone with such a bad take is really frustrating
The Witness,Nice video.
The Witness,"3:35 but......there is lol what are you talking about? every single area in the game is full of new and interesting ideas that keep evolving in new and interesting ways. just take the desert as an example, you seem to dislike that the puzzles involve finding the right position to see the solution in the glare, but i don't see why that would in any way be poor game design? having to infer where the glare would appear from the angle of the pannel and the light source in each specific room is imo a very engaging gameplay loop and the witness never stops throwing curveballs at the player to test if they are paying attention (like the room where you can change the lights or the one with the raising water, which were both very well designed btw). sure its not the most complex idea out there and this area as a whole is very short compared to the time it takes to complete the other but im pretty sure this was intentional as the desert is one of the easiest areas to acess after you complete the symetry puzzles in the begining of the game (i mean its literally impossible to not see lmao). i get why you would dislike it but you seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding that the puzzle IS finding out the right way to look at them. idk its just overall super strange for someone to solve the pannel and then look at it like ""oh see the solution is to just find the right angle to look at it"" when its already solved and there is not much more left to do? its very reductive to just point at the solutions instead of the steps you have to take to find it.


oh yeah and you were also right about how the game is not accesible to deaf and colourblind people but to pretend the way to solve that would just be adding options for to diferent colour configurations and closed captions almost makes me think that you werent paying attention at all to what you were playing, like, you realise you cant just fix it right? please tell me you dont"
The Witness,"Funny, good points, well presented. I enjoyed the game so I'll give a defense or two. Couterpoints that occurred to me watching this:

1. Lots of people who played this ended up using out-of-game tools to work out various puzzles. But if you watch a few different playthroughs, you'll see that they differ almost completely on _which_ puzzles demanded this. Some people could do the mirroring and rotation tasks in their mind's eye effortlessly, but needed to keep elaborate notes for the chromatic-light rooms. Some people know their RGB/CMY color wheel so intimately that even the busted elevator cable didn't slow them down, but were too tonedeaf to discern pitches for the sound puzzles. I'm a musician and I found those ones trivial. But it took me embarrassingly long to make anything happen in the treehouse complex. Since so many of the puzzles' core challenges are perceptual, and since players are so wildly different from each other in physical ability as well as what their brains are wired to notice right away and what they overlook for hours, I don't think there could have been any way to tune the difficulty so that the challenges are all tractable with only your own faculties... except by making them all really, really easy. Which would suck.

So some of the puzzles were inaccessible to colorblind people, some of them were inaccessible to deaf people or people with poor pitch perception, some were inaccessible to gamers with twitchy-3d-shooter tunnel vision who are unable to see anything that isn't moving, and some to players with weaker spatial reasoning who can't easily rotate or flip shapes in their heads, or who don't sufficiently understand the geometry of light sources, surfaces and reflections, etc. All of these obstacles can be worked around, one way or another, using out-of-game tools as you did. A colorblind person's 'correct' way of solving that area would probably be no different from your way of solving the invisible-reflection problem. In that sense, I think the game was designed to put all of these obstacles on roughly equal footing. 

(I also think they intend to take the 'meta' into account: it's assumed that players aren't playing in a vacuum, and that when they get stuck enough, especially if they're a content-seeking completionist type of player, many will end up looking up hints or solutions, and it isn't the end of the world if they do. [Especially if they know that a disability might be making it literally impossible to solve on their own.] And if they aren't completionists, I guess that's why you don't need to get every laser to reach the 'normal' ending.)

2. I understand being frustrated by how slow-moving the game is, but again given that the core challenges are more about _noticing_ things than about figuring things out with cognitive brute force... I think that the too-slow elevator is a hint aimed straight at those who need it most. Asking yourself ""why is this dang elevator so slow?"" is meant to make you reexamine your surroundings and wonder what they're trying to make you notice.

A high-speed action gamer who never stops moving, is always frantically whipping their mouse around from viewpoint to viewpoint, strafe-running to save time, leaning on the Shift key all day, is likely to miss critical clues in the environment. And insofar as the game is constantly punishing you for being in too much of a hurry, these ""forced slowness"" moments seem to me, intended to give you a chance to see things that you'd otherwise sprint right over. To my thinking, they are almost charitable.

You know that cliche'd thing from TV and movies where, maybe the 2 protagonists are on the run from a monster or something, and one of them has spotted it, and the other one is too busy talking or focusing on something-or-other, so the one character just grabs the other's head and turns it and makes them hold still and look? 

Y'know, this maneuver: https://youtu.be/22Ju9XYdT8A?t=23

That's what J.Blow is doing on the excruciatingly slow elevator or moving platform or whatever; he's grabbing your head and holding it still for a minute and saying ""look"". If you're stuck there for three quarters of a minute and you have nothing to do except pay attention to your surroundings - and maybe even do some random experimental mouse-clicking to while away the time - you might accidentally make a discovery which you'd otherwise have no hope of making.

3. I'm not sure, but did you make it through the whole game without spotting the environmental puzzles and the underground labyrinth and so on? Because you said you were going to spoil the whole thing, and then you didn't mention a whole swathe of the more hidden challenges and content at all. If you didn't encounter any of that, I'm not surprised you were underwhelmed by the game. But if the Witness has one central message, I think it's to humble and chastise our tendency to assume what we see is all there is, and remind us we should never be *too* confident that we're not overlooking something right in front of us.

IMO, the moral of the whole game is kinda ""If you didn't see anything there, maybe that's *not* because there was nothing to see."""
The Witness,"I liked the game a lot, but boy was it pretentious. It should know that my only philosophical viewpoint is getting a damn dot through a square maze to open whatever door it is wired to. lol"
The Witness,"My experience was opposite yours. I really liked Braid, so I was excited about this game, but the trailer looked kind of boring to me. I thought a bunch of puzzle boards didn't look interesting at all, but again...I really liked Braid so I thought I'd have to try it.

I really loved it...and was honestly surprised how into it I got. Sorry you didn't enjoy it, but to call it a bad game or badly designed doesn't seem right.

Nice video though! Watched it to the end, you are entertaining 🙂"
The Witness,"You’ve missed the point of the game! It’s not about enjoying yourself, it’s about knowing that Jonathan Blow hates you personally and wants you to suffer"
The Witness,"in Very video critiques you good had this!  (only 1% of people can understand this puzzle sentence)

Many of us would prefer to be deaf than to listen to the last few ""bird"" puzzles
But to be unfair to you, the game is downright miserable for people that can't visualize the solutions, mentally moving the shapes and lines around, without saving screenshots and drawing them out first.

But I must agree with you, the desert temple is shit. Concentrated, slow-motion, excrement
It's like the California of this game and should sink into the ocean. 

Personally, I love this game, and it's one of my favorite things, but I don't respect myself or my time, so that might explain it.
Cheers"
The Witness,"00:52   Funnily enough, actually it's right there at this point where I see how GREAT The Witness is going to be: because it's conveying it's puzzle mechanics and conditions brilliantly without so much as a single textbox.   I believe The Witness is masterclass in ""conveyance"", it's sheer brilliance in teaching, I love when games do that.  Not many games are able to achieve that as well as The Witness does."
The Witness,All puzzles are obfuscation…that’s the definition of a puzzle…
The Witness,"It's clear that you haven't understood anything about what the game is actually about. That's not a bad thing, it's something the maker of the game knew would happen for many people. You could argue that that's a failing on the game, but I think the things the game is saying are deep enough that it's fine as collateral damage."
The Witness,You are too dull to enjoy such a genius game!
The Witness,Just  finished this game for the first time last week and wow it was horrible.  Which is a shame because the environment is gorgeous.  That island deserved a better game.
The Witness,Thank you.  It is so good to hear my own frustrations articulated and explained so well. I don't understand why this game was as highly rated as it was.
The Witness,"Just stopped playing this game at the quarry. I was iffy on all of them including the mirror and shadow puzzles. Then we get to the fucking quarry, where it introduces this completely vague, un-explained, mechanic that ""excludes"" an error? Like, how the fuck are you supposed to figure THAT out without a tutorial. All it does is bleep at you, and flashes a light on mutliple seemingly random points, until you look it up and OH OKAY? Then immedietely adds ANOTHER fucking color at you and your just like WHY? DO I KEEP IT INSIDE THE LIGHTS? DO I NOT? WHY? Its horrible. The earlier puzzles were at least environmental, you could figure them out from context, or just wiggling around the map until the light shines on the right spot so your like OOHHH. Im here to play a game, not solve alien scriptures. I feel like this game would have been much better if it just kept it at environmental challenges. I really liked the beach area. 
At its core, its a game that makes you feel dumb, rather than triumph at solving a puzzle. Instead your just like OH GREAT, THATS what I was supposed to do. Especially with all these pretentious quotes scattered around the world."
The Witness,"I loved the witness. I loved the idea that figuring out what the puzzle was is more important than solving it (this is the only criticism I disagree with, I am a fan of this aspect). I loved the fact that the game is like a metroidvania where the abilities you unlock are understanding how the symbols work which you learn elsewhere.

Every criticism in your video (aside from the one I said I disagreed with) is 100% correct. I'm especially upset with Jon Blow about the lack of accessibility where you literally cannot beat the game if you have a common disability like colorblindness. The ship puzzle was INEXCUSABLY terrible. There's an environment puzzle that requires you to watch an hour long GDC presentation to solve it. The game wastes the ever loving SHIT out of your time and that only wasn't a problem for me because for some reason I had an insane amount of patience. But yeah there are a lot of reasons to hate this game, and even as a person who liked it, I think all of yours (including the one I disagreed with because I do feel that's a matter of personal preference) are completely valid."
The Witness,"While I consider it one of my favorite games, I can't really knock anyone for hating it; I do have some points though

1. Is there really a problem with using resources outside the game? (As in paint, photoshop etc.)
2. I'd argue the water in that part with the reflection puzzles goes slowly to give you enough time to check different screens
3. I agree the part of the review you showed IS funny and kind of ridiculous, but it doesn't seem fair to show that's the only reason people like this game
4. I genuinely think the game looks good, especially from a color perspective, it's very vibrant
5. While I agree games should be accessible for everyone (I'd say a game like Celeste nails it on the head), I don't really think there would be a really good solution for the sound one, writing captions would just give a away the answer
6. I really like basically every environmental puzzle, they're just so fun to find

Some parts I agree with

1. The game really is too slow sometimes, that part when you instantly run to get off the boat is very relatable
2. It's definitely a little bit too convoluted at times
3. I do agree that a colorblind option would've been nice

I can't blame you for making this video though, the game has always been divisive"
The Witness,"I think I liked The Witness in the same way I liked Dark Souls: it's not just about solving the puzzle/beating the bosses, it's about learning how to solve/beat them even when they start leaning on the unfair side. The frustration is only there to make your triumph better in the end. I remember being as excited about getting to activate a lazer as I was beating a tough Dark Souls boss, because it had been a hard journey to get there."
The Witness,"I really like this channel. 
I can't believe how many high quality videos you have and you're still so small. 
Hope you blow up soon. 
If you want that."
The Witness,"I view The Witness as an interesting experiment, playing with a lot of ideas in game design and theme. Silent tutorialization, iterating on a single puzzle type, player driven exploration. The environmental storytelling, the audio logs, the unlockable video clips and the secret ending all hint at bigger ideas and explanations that somehow never come together into a single thesis. Everything about the game is both enticing, but also unsatisfying. Your reward for solving puzzles is always more puzzles.

The entire game is built to get the player to ask ""Why am I doing this?""

I can only imagine Jonathan Blow laughing, because both he and the game are completely uninterested in answering that question. If the game has any thesis at all, it would be ""I don't know, why are you doing this?""

Which is deeply frustrating. Frustration is one of the core emotions the game is trying to elicit, on every level, 100% intentionally. This is why everything moves slow and wastes your time. The biggest offender is anytime you need to use the boat to solve puzzles in the environment. The game doesn't require you to do any of this. It certainly doesn't reward you. Everything about the game is driven by player curiosity. The designers can say ""You did this to yourself"", as if they had nothing to do with the meticulously crafted trap they lead you into.

I completely understand anyone who loves the game. I also completely understand anyone who hates it, doesn't get it or doesn't see what the big deal is. I'm glad a game like this exists and I'm glad I played it. But mostly, I'm glad we have The Witness so no one needs to make a game like this again."
The Witness,"there are a lot of valid points here, but did you know there is a time challenge at the end of the game?
if you are screen-shotting to work out the puzzles, that would force you to try something new. i dont think having memory as an aspect of puzzle solving makes for an inherently bad puzzle, but it could definitely have the fun / challenge removed. i'd say its a similar situation to save-scumming. sure a lot of games even let you quick load / save - its 100% intended by the developer, but doing it too much can ruin your experience.

as someone with a particularly bad memory, i thought i'd do terribly, but managed to surprise myself when i tried.

a large part of the fun for me was seeing how the different puzzle elements interact with each-other after learning their rules individually. this definitely can lead to bad experiences like the ship, where it's not obvious if you played the invisible line or audio section a long time before, but it comes together well in other parts of the game."
The Witness,"dude, eg throw again"
The Witness,"This was such a fun video that kept me hooked all throughout. I never have delved into the Blow-verse so The Witness always came off to me as one of those games Joseph Anderson would cover and that’d be enough for me to understand about it (both if which became true lol). Plus, how good can The Witness really be without a Companion Cube? I mean, c’mon."
The Witness,"I agree with some of your general criticisms. The temple gets repetitive quick, the jungle is a little obtuse. But you didn’t bring up the quote players at all, and if you paid attention, you might find that their content actually addresses several of your criticisms. For instance, have you considered that the game might be taking things slowly on purpose? Not to waste your time, but to teach you the value of patience when you’re working on anything difficult? There’s a quote from Einstein near the Sun Temple where he brings up that very point.
Also, I don’t think it’s cheating to use some help when you’re solving the puzzles. But I don’t agree that the game is implicitly telling you to take notes. You can solve every puzzle in the game inside your own head if you’re focused."
The Witness,"This is the kind of design I really hate. Like if something makes me think a lot and I need to use notes to sort it out cool! But this is not that.

The 4 puzzles combined just made me think the game sounds like homework"
The Witness,"*Totally Agree on...*
- Sun Temple Bad
- Sound Jungle Bad
- Game Frustrating

*Respectfully...*
- Taking Notes Ain't Cheating
- The slow bits conceal the fun puzzles. Just another code to decipher.
- You can see the mazes from above. The answer is right in front of you.

The elevator is a fake/bad ending. The Challenge is how you get 100%.

*Get Good* (I'm subbed you legally cannot be mad at me.)"
The Witness,"I respect your opinion and you make some great points, I do however still disagree with most of what you said xD

The fact that drawing lines on boards is so restrictive and the witness still manages to come up with new and fresh ideas every time is amazing to me.
You've talked about how it is especially with the light reflection puzzles and that they repeat all the time. That part of the game is extremely short though and you basically showed every single puzzle that part of the game has to offer, meaning it cant have been repeated that often can it ? ^^

On another note, your bit with the water going down so excruciatingly slowly is one of my favourite parts of the game, since its also part of a meta environment puzzle. I love that this game just makes you think, because everything seems so stupid at first but probably has a purpose for something else. It makes you look at the game world with different eyes, always wondering if there could be something hidden.

I also never had to draw anything outside of the game or go back to look at the 4 puzzles in the garden for example.

And last thing, I actually dont get what your bit about the artstyle and look of the game was supposed to mean, the game does look great lmao

I do agree with the accesibility problem however."
The Witness,so it wasn't just me who though this game is way more frustrating
The Witness,Fantastic video. You explained my frustrations with the game so clearly.
The Witness,"As an obsessive explorer kind of gamer, I’d say that mediocre puzzles or not I loved the way the environment was built with all the little visual tricks and motivations for the player to look at things from all angles, mixing statues with shadows, reflections with objects, and combining lines through perspective despite them being spatially divided via automatic movement. I see additional program only value in the game to the parts that are definitely encouraged to overcome via out of game tools such as screenshots &pen and paper"
The Forgotten City,Is there magic in this game?
The Forgotten City,Lmao who else was annoyed when you free duli for the first time 😂💀
The Forgotten City,can these fkn developers stop shoehorning diversity into every single fkn game in existence??....
The Forgotten City,but why so short gameplay
The Forgotten City,"Hold up...
   What do you mean it was a *Skyrim mod* ?! 🤯"
The Forgotten City,Strapped like a seatbelt in ancient Rome
The Forgotten City,All bad things cant and dont accept bad Thanks and these are not reall
The Forgotten City,Fuckin ads
The Forgotten City,Just finished it and damn what a great game 👑
The Forgotten City,PASS on this then? Yea... thx
The Forgotten City,👎👎👎👉🏾💩💩💩🤮
The Forgotten City,This game looks like hell on an Xbox.
The Forgotten City,Played the whole game and loved it to death! Galerius my beloved
The Forgotten City,"Now this is REALLY impressive!! They had already did wonders when they made the mod for Skyrim, which must've taken an arm and a leg to create, but to think that they went out of there way to make their own independent game of it! That's genuine dedication right there. The world in this version looks so beautiful."
The Forgotten City,a smaller skyrim but with more quality
The Forgotten City,Wait this was used to be a Skyrim mod?
The Forgotten City,One of the best games i've ever played... by far
The Forgotten City,"""a wildly* useful** feature that lets you tap a key*** to automatically**** follow an NPC (if they're guiding you to a set location*****)""


*Remember pressing it twice during my 6hr playthru

**Prompted both times to press
*** Tried using 12x during campaign. 
**** No. lol.
***** The only time it would be useful is during the endgame when you want to observe the entire universe, which the ""game"" does not allow

It's a very well written Skyrim Mod.
Everything else is extraneous."
The Forgotten City,"jeez, flatscreen games still?? what is this 1996?? no vr no buy"
The Forgotten City,What IS this background music?
The Forgotten City,"If you haven’t played this game yet, stop watching this review and play it. It’s a great game and this video is full of spoilers. You wont be disappointed!"
The Forgotten City,"Its a great game 👍🏻 different and very interesting, wonderful atmosphere"
The Forgotten City,What’s a Mod?
The Forgotten City,0/10 no swords
The Forgotten City,Game is fire
The Forgotten City,Dianas Bow! did you play the game?
The Forgotten City,GAME PASS BABYYYYY
The Forgotten City,"""THE MANY SHALL SUFFER FOR THE SINS OF THE ONE""
Should be the official motto of the Left and the Democratic party..."
The Forgotten City,it just looks so boring
The Forgotten City,So far enjoying this game a lot just got into it and it already has my attention as it was brought to gamepass
The Forgotten City,Looking for HONEST reviews on Xbox please. So tired of smoke being blown on how great these games are...dud after dud.

The Forgotten City,When does it release for ps5?
The Forgotten City,so it's like skyrim set in ancient wome with 90s tv animation graphics
The Forgotten City,Anyone know when this game is coming to the Switch? I'd love to play it on my fav. handheld. :)
The Forgotten City,Mod becoming a game. What a dream
The Forgotten City,0.9/10

The Forgotten City,Looks terrible 🤣
The Forgotten City,"So, can we run the game on intel HD 

















🤣"
The Forgotten City,"@0:24
""Breaking away from the Elder Scrolls Universe...""

Takes place in literally Rome...

Could've named it Cyrodill or the Imperial City. XD"
The Forgotten City,"Anyone who complains about the missions markers and whispers being spoilers, you can turn them off if you explore the menu for like 10seconds."
The Forgotten City,Is this single player only or can it be played co op? Also really cool how this was driven by a mod!
The Forgotten City,"It should have said Phoebus at the beginning, not Apollo."
The Forgotten City,9 for this game 😁
The Forgotten City,Decent game with political propaganda infused with the plot. Very off putting
The Forgotten City,"Oh Great YET ANOTHER ""RPG"" game that is only in first person"
The Forgotten City,I'm going to buy this
The Forgotten City,SO MANY SPOILERS!!!
The Forgotten City,"It's really impressive the small studio had the courage to tackle facial animations at that scale, rather than shying away by instead using animal characters, hand drawn or pixel art animations, or having the human characters taking up much less space in the camera's field of view."
The Forgotten City,2:06 seems like lara croft is the guest of honor
The Forgotten City,Is this only first person?
The Forgotten City,Is the 29.99 ps store the ps5 version also?
The Forgotten City,does this game have character creation or a lvl up system like Skyrim? or Better??
The Forgotten City,FALLOUT DLC
The Forgotten City,they should make enderal too to full fledged game
The Forgotten City,why 1st person? why !
The Forgotten City,"Can't wait, his original mod was amazing!"
The Forgotten City,"Loved it, gonna give it a try!"
The Forgotten City,Now we just need someone to mod Skyrim back into the Forgotten City. I'd play Skyrim in this engine
The Forgotten City,is this rpg where you can choose your own actions and stuff?
The Forgotten City,to much to read
The Forgotten City,What does next gen bring to the game
The Forgotten City,the npcs talks like fallout 1  level but you need to see the oblivion to give this game 9. are you out of your mind.  this no near when oblivion on 2006. its like new assasins creeds educational mods.
The Forgotten City,10 hours for $40? Pass
The Forgotten City,Is the story different from the original mod?
The Forgotten City,is this game use the same asset as The Outer Worlds?
The Forgotten City,better than most aaa titles nowadays
The Forgotten City,BORRRRRRIIIIIINNMNNGGG!!!
The Forgotten City,Never heard of this until now but I’m intrigued
The Forgotten City,IGN gave Skyrim a 9.5 to put this game into comparison. This game also has about the same IGN score as The Witcher 3.
The Forgotten City,9/10
The Forgotten City,Can't wait to get this when it's on sale
The Forgotten City,Skyrim copycat shieeet
The Forgotten City,2:01 Roman Africa .....
The Forgotten City,That is not Roman architecture. It is appropriated ancient African architecture. (Kemet to be exact)
The Forgotten City,No diversity black and white in everything
The Forgotten City,"Developer here: Just wanted to say thank you for the great review of our game and thank you to the community for all the support and kind words. If you'd like to be notified when The Forgotten City is released, please wishlist / pre-order on your favourite platform."
The Forgotten City,Just curious is it coming to gamepass?
The Forgotten City,👍
The Forgotten City,Why is she dressing like that boy from last guardian tho
The Forgotten City,Why is she dressing like that boy from last guardian tho
The Forgotten City,The faces may be lifeless to an occasionally comical degree but isn't that perhaps the game just trying to remain TES accurate?
The Forgotten City,Give us the uncensored version for PC
The Forgotten City,"Take TWo should learn a thing or 2 from this, instead of DMCA the entire mods for all GTA games and threatening a modding website. What a disgusting company. 
I'm never buying a game from you again GTA VI included."
The Forgotten City,Is this on gamepass
The Forgotten City,“The many shall suffer for the sins of the one” that’s Activision’s new management motto right? 🙄
The Forgotten City,so this is part of the elder scroll series? im kinda confused
The Forgotten City,"Hey all - just got an email from the developer about the 'whispered hints' issue. Here's what he had to say: 

Quick update: I've just added an update to the game, allowing bold players to disable hints, forcing them to figure out all the game's puzzles on their own. The update, along with instructions, is here: https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/874260/view/2983057384598164970"
The Forgotten City,"i thought they did a good job with it, good story, good characters, i was invested through 4 completions and getting all endings."
The Forgotten City,You should also try Enderal: Forgotten Stories if you haven't already.
The Forgotten City,"From the perspective of a game developer and fellow lover of Outer Wilds, I consider you the most professional English reviewer on youtube. Thanks to you I don't have to play many games (for research). That being said, this one particular review is very bad. Thankfully I played the game on my own prior to watching this video. I wouldn't know shit about this game from just the review - except for poor face animations. The game has minor flaws but even among them, those animations are the least important. You did not describe how the time loop works here, perhaps in order not to spoil the game, but it's still something relatively fresh and unique. Imagine the world where there are just several FPS games like HF1, HF2, maybe Doom, then FC6 is released (done by a small team) and you shit all over it, it is the vibe of your review. We do not have many games in this time-loop ""genre"" and this game is doing a great job in its field. Different than OW, but still good."
The Forgotten City,I just can't get over the fact that many NPCs in this game seem to be cross-eyed.
The Forgotten City,"It's a download on ps plus, imma give it shot."
The Forgotten City,"Lucretia is black.....pass.
not in my Rome. 
la mia cultura non sarà cambiata dalle persone anglo."
The Forgotten City,"Got this on PS plus now. I enjoyed the storyline a lot. Sure, some technical issues here and there, but nothing major. I'll be looking forward for games made by this studio"
The Forgotten City,Comment for the SKull Throne
The Forgotten City,"I just played this! I enjoyed it somewhat, I do think there should have been an option to convince Pluto to come down to Earth and join humanity with Proserpina to experience what it's like to not be immortal."
The Forgotten City,I'm glad that the Forgotten City stayed on Gamepass for months. Highly recommended to those who enjoyed Telltale game.
The Forgotten City,Picked this game up today on the back of this review.. nice1 Skill Up
The Forgotten City,Thanks
The Forgotten City,"18:07 absolutely true. At first i installed it knowing nothing about the game or its history. When i first played it i did not like it, like he mentioned it felt like a walking simulator. But the fun starts once the loop begin. I do not agree being harsh on this game because it's been developed by only theee people. Imagine what more they could've achieved if it was developed by more people. In a world where studios like Ubisoft/EA create massive bloated shit with tons of resources and get away with it, people like these three deserve way more recognition than they actually got."
The Forgotten City,I just tried the game on game pass love galarius
The Forgotten City,I played this and it was amazing. Such a great narrative 10/10
The Forgotten City,Overly harsh review.
The Forgotten City,"Just started getting around to this, as it's on Game Pass and it's the kind of indie game I figured deserves a try. I'm on my third loop now and I'm really impressed by the quality of the writing and voiceover work."
The Forgotten City,Skillup never fails to deliver genuinely helpful reviews. Not just rants on if it's good or not. I'm looking forward to playing this. Hopefully it'll help scratch that Skyrim itch I have.
The Forgotten City,"It’s on GamePass now, which is how I just played it."
The Forgotten City,Good news! This is available on Game Pass!
The Forgotten City,This was perfect to play on GamePass
The Forgotten City,Skyrim. A little-known game?!  Where have you been?
The Forgotten City,"What is this ""Skyspin"" game you mention....?  🤔"
The Forgotten City,"Just got this game and was hooked till I got the final ending. For a small 3 person crew this game hits the mark for me at least, I look forward to future titles from this crew"
The Forgotten City,"That ending of, ""I wish this was on Game Pass"" is particularly relevant because I just saw this game on Game Pass. And wanted to know if it was worth the storage space. Thanks, perfect ending."
The Forgotten City,"""Metroidvania of the mind""
One of the best popculturally relevant phrases of 2021."
The Forgotten City,How you still make jokes about covid but Australia literally has camps that they put people in and you CANNOT leave....
The Forgotten City,"""I really wish this was on Game Pass""

Signing in from the future to let you all know the game is now on Game Pass!"
The Forgotten City,This game is on Game Pass now!
The Forgotten City,"6:25 I unfortunately had a bit of a worse experience in this regard. The game crashed on me 5 times in total, and I got a particularly nasty glitch that activated the time loop early right after I did a certain action that you *have* to do to beat the game. Of course, at the time, I didn't know that it was a glitch, and as a result, I was led to the incorrect conclusion that the action I did activated the golden rule. Spoilers for this specific scenario below:

I told the assassin to go into the shrine (whose roof is about to fall down). As soon as I told him this, the golden rule was activated, which I assumed was because I basically told him to go somewhere that would inevitably lead to his death. So I reloaded my save and tried a different approach, which inevitably lead to my death. Then I reloaded my save again and tried just leaving that quest alone for a while, and the golden rule didn't activate. So at that point I was absolutely certain that me telling him to go to the shrine had activated the golden rule - there was no other logical conclusion. Eventually, I had no quests left that could be done before taking care of the assassin, and I had exhausted all possible dialogue options with him, so I figured I was just stuck. So I exhausted all the dialogue options when talking to the assassin, and none of them worked. Then after wasting a pretty dumb amount of time on that, I finally gave in and decided looked up a guide online, and guess what it told me? It fucking told me to tell him to go to the damn shrine, 'cause it's the only way to progress the game. And this time when I tried it, the golden rule didn't activate... Because of course it didn't. A glitch made the correct solution to a critical quest look like a fail state...

I was playing on Game Pass for PC, btw, in case that makes a difference. Still enjoyed the game overall, but that glitch was really frustrating 😅"
The Forgotten City,"I disagreed about the whispers. They kept talking but I would still be like, “what the solution to this?” Even with the whispers I still couldn’t find the answers"
The Forgotten City,"I have the same thoughts about the game though apparently you can turn off the hints now.  Unfortunately, I didn't explore the options much and didn't think of trying to check if there's an option to turn it off 😅 Aside from the hints, sometimes the dialogues can be a spoiler too though I guess it's inherent to this type of game. I think this game is for the people who didn't like Outer Wilds because of it being hard or frustrating 😄 I really enjoyed this game nonetheless."
The Forgotten City,"You can turn off the hints now. I actually recently played it and it was one of my favorite games I played last year. I left the hints on and really I didn't mind them, it makes sense narratively that the voice is trying to help you because [spoilers], so its justified within the narrative. I wasn't thinking of it as a puzzle game though, I was viewing it as a narrative game more purely. I think if you don't look at it as a puzzle game, it works fine."
The Forgotten City,Will say i was under the impression the voice wasn't fully trustable. Still playing through it but the mystery of who is speaking through the statues intriguing. Guess they could've solved it by having the voice lie sometimes to throw you off.   My paranoid ass already assumed the voice was lying
The Forgotten City,GAMEPASS BABY
The Forgotten City,This was made by three people… not a Ubisoft team.
The Forgotten City,"Just downloaded this since it came to the switch, so far so good!!"
The Forgotten City,"I guess I screwed myself a little, because of my dear and lovely mom.

She is sadly not what you could call a gamer, even if she loves my tales about the things I play or sometimes watches me play, she doesn't enjoy gaming herself. Which is again sad, because she is really sharp and with good taste.

And... she was next to me starting the game... and I will say she _recognized_ Karen.
She even showed interest in where the story could go from that point forward (and she was kind of right) so... yeah, I kind of spoiled myself one of the game's themes from the very start, and felt annoyed I didn't _recognize_ Karen too at that moment, as once you know is kind of obvious xD"
The Forgotten City,"Game of this year imo. Something fresh again, and 2021 wasn't a strong gaming year to begin with. 

I would recommend playing it to anyone who is tired of the monotony of many triple A games today."
The Forgotten City,This is on Gamepass now :D
The Forgotten City,"Hi, great video. I liked that this review had some valid criticisms about the game. I would like to add one more. I liked the diversity of characters but I found them to be too consistent, Like the writer decided on a single adjective for each of them and wrote them strictly to that. I was also expecting more machinations. But still a good game i thought."
The Forgotten City,"This game was such an incredible experience. I love history and seeing the absolutely beautiful environment of my favorite time period made me instantly fall in love. The story was rewarding and had a nice payoff. The canon ending was cheesy but I didn’t really care that much. The way they tied in the pantheons of the romans and the previous three generations was really cool imo. 

I think in general there’s a massive niche for historical non-strategy games that needs to be exploited by a savvy developer. Why invent some random mythical world when the ones in history are just as incredible"
The Forgotten City,It's on gamepass now.
The Forgotten City,Great review but got very distracted by the music in the first third being exactly the same as the music from this audiobook podcast I've been listening to with my 7yo kid lol!
The Forgotten City,"Is now on game pass, the gods indeed listen to our prayers."
The Forgotten City,I just try this game I love skyrim but this game isn't for me
The Forgotten City,Xbox Game Pass is awesome for playing games you never heard of before or would buy Like this one 🤗
The Forgotten City,the guide is part of the story...
The Forgotten City,"I just started playing this game recently and it's pretty good so far but I have to admit I was really disappointed that I couldn't bash Karen over the head with my flashlight. I tried ever button combination I could think of and nothing would let me bash Karen over the head with my flashlight. If the developers read this, please fix this oversight in the game. Thank you."
The Forgotten City,Well this is on Game Pass now. Time to try it out!
The Forgotten City,Now in Game pass my dudes
The Forgotten City,This game is like the opposite of Outer Wilds. This game has a great story and lacking gameplay. That game has great gameplay and lacking story lol.
The Forgotten City,"It's a good time but oftentimes I was lost and I couldn't get around the cross-eyed-looking people. Hopefully, they add some directions and fix their facial animations. It's nothing anywhere near the quality of a game of the year to me, tbh."
The Forgotten City,Are you going to review Deathloop?
The Forgotten City,"This game looks like it sucks honestly lol… loved Skyrim though. I don’t blame it on the budget either, there’s tons of HUGE budget games that are complete dog water… Cyberpunk (cough cough)"
The Forgotten City,"Im going to get it on PC,but I just tried the cloud gaming demo on switch where I can through it as fast as I could, and skipped all dialogue because they give a really short amount of time.
The switch game looked just as good as the footage you showed(being ran on the cloud) it ran smooth and looked good.
But won't buy it there because what if servers ever shut down, and I don't want to use tons of bandwidth playing through it.
But if you only have a switch get it, it looks just as good as this footage"
The Forgotten City,I like this game but as I get older...I fucking hate backtracking in any game.....and because of the time mechanic.....it just tired me out quickly but if you have the patience....the world seems beautifully crafted.
The Forgotten City,Majority of the comments are about skyrim...
The Forgotten City,"After 7-8hours of playtime and finishing this game (1 ending) 
One of the greatest games I've ever played 
(A dark truth,I pirated it, but I'm definitely buying it soon)"
The Forgotten City,Skill up one of the only negative reviewers of this game 😂 thank  god we dont listen  to reviewers  😜
The Forgotten City,SKILL UP!! CHECK OUT Naser: Son of Man
The Forgotten City,"The joke is only fun once, maybe twice. But when ever person in the comments is doing it, it makes it lame lol."
The Forgotten City,You know this game is based on a Skyrim mod when you can get a gun if you start as a soldier.
The Forgotten City,"Holy shit, I remember the mod! I remember hearing about it on Good Game way back!
Man... nostalgia is kicking in."
The Forgotten City,"The biggest issue I have with the game were the whispers. I played the original mod and loved how it didn't hold my hands when exploring. I remembered how I actually used to take down notes using a notebook mod that I installed but never really used, until I played the forgotten city mod. Hopefully they fix this..."
The Forgotten City,"I recently finished playing this game and loved it. I had no knowledge or expectations going in so that may have helped.
The criticisms the video makes are fair, but overall didn't detract from the experience for me, as on balance the strengths fair outweighed the weaknesses.
Like the reviewer, I absolutely adored Outer Wilds and share his opinion that it is one of the greatest games ever made. The biggest praise I can give TLC is that it gave me the same kind of feeling playing it as Outer Wilds - not exactly the same, and this game is much shorter and smaller - but enough that it satisfied that itch.
Would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes dialogue-based puzzle adventures or time loops."
The Forgotten City,Skyrim? Never heard of it. Must have been BURIED under a Cloud District.
The Forgotten City,"You've laid claim that Outer Wilds is possibly the greatest game ever created and immediately said that's a topic for another video... Well? WHERE'S THAT VIDEO, MAN!"
The Forgotten City,Damn why didn't we hear enough about Skyrim though?! I couldn't even find videos on youtube about or memes or anything really! Like what the actual hell?!
The Forgotten City,"You can disable the hints in the menu, but it remains freaking easy and guided"
The Forgotten City,"I actually played the mod for skyrim and the standalone game now that it came out and I really love it , although I knew some of the twists and plot points because I played the mod ( like the fate of a certain girl that disappeared ) so maybe it had less of an effect on me than what it could've , but they did change / improve a ton of other things and the narrative is great , also getting that last ending was satisfying as fuck . 
All in all , really enjoyabe game with a great narrative that I would recommend playing at some point"
The Forgotten City,at the end of the day you have to respect a tiny team of people making something this good when armies of AAA developers cant seem to put out complete games with more time to work on it.
The Forgotten City,"I'm sorry Skill Up, but you legitimately look like an NPC from the Forgotten City. LMFAO"
The Forgotten City,"Outer wilds is the greatest game ever???
When i tried it, after fiddling for way too long figuring how to fly this stupid space ship i flew to some place, a destroyed house or something in space i cant remember exactly, i went out to explore and my character got stuck there, in this place, with nothing to see, nothing to interact with, all i experienced was being incredibly frustrated and bored and that i was being punished for exploring. It was the most miserable gaming experience of my life right behind superman 64 as a kid which says a lot."
The Forgotten City,I never played Skyrim. This looks cool. The Whisper also seems like it would be my biggest gripe. Hate that.
The Forgotten City,The game is so gooood!
The Forgotten City,It's on Steam!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The Forgotten City,Jesus Christ loves you
The Forgotten City,"I loved the mod and really want to try the game but I really just feel like 40 bucks isn’t justified. I want to support these guys but it feels like the game is a 20-30$ game. Maybe even less. Gamepass would knock this out of the park, but otherwise I don’t quite understand the high price, unless there’s a lot more story or gameplay not being talked about. The mod was pretty short and this doesn’t sound a hell of a lot longer."
The Forgotten City,So the game didn't disrespect your time enough to be enjoyable. Uh... ok.
The Forgotten City,"I just played through it, based on your review. Honestly, best damn gaming experience I've had in years. I really felt appreciated for my time playing it...albeit short, but SO fulfilling. Also note: I went to the settings and turned off Hints, but unlike your experience, the (spoilers) never once gave me ANY hints. Maybe a recent patch fixed this. (Ah yep, I see your update lol). Yea man, without the Hints....fucking brilliant gameplay experience."
The Forgotten City,I really don’t get the appeal of time loops in games. It’s the primary reason why I gave up on the outer winds. I despised the 22 minute restriction to exploring the galaxy. It made me feel rushed constantly and frustrated me when I was forced to start back at the home base constantly.
The Forgotten City,Skyrim when This game will come out. Can i play it on ps5?
The Forgotten City,Thanks for the vid
The Forgotten City,Seems like the original mod was much better.
The Forgotten City,"I disagree that the facial animations are on the whole bad or awkward. There are some NPCs (like a woman hiding from a newcomer) who have truly odd faces but others, like Galerius, have much more realistic faces and expressions. Definitely a step up from Mass Effect Andromeda NPC animation, so I think the lack of major lapses there makes any other facial awkwardness largely forgivable."
The Forgotten City,I remember playing the forgotten city years ago. Probably the best mod I’ve ever downloaded for any game I’ve ever played. Absolutely awesome questline
The Forgotten City,The mod felt very tedious to me so I unistalled it
The Forgotten City,Darn
The Forgotten City,"Hey loved this review! Will get this game even though I played the mod, lmao.

Dude, review Wildermyth, please! The game deserves it!

If you like D&D, you'll love it"
The Forgotten City,This looks like a lot of fun now that they're given you a toggle to remove the hints.
The Forgotten City,"8:11

*ShillUp*"
The Forgotten City,"Man, this Skyrim game looks great. I'll have to try and chase down a copy somehow."
The Forgotten City,This game has Karen jokes??? Epic reddit moment
The Forgotten City,Holy shit yes. That shouldn't happen. What were they thinking? These prompts to reduce difficulty are the worst. The game shouldn't tell you the Answer unless you as a Player make an input for it.
The Forgotten City,This is my favorite game of 2021 so far.
The Forgotten City,"Wrong, best Skyrim mod is cbb"
The Forgotten City,ShillUp lol
The Forgotten City,I am so hyped for your Outer Wilds video
Dead Cells,Sheep
Dead Cells,This game is as close to perfect as a 2D game can be
Dead Cells,Can u all talk about the fuking game and not the review
Dead Cells,you know why you're here :)
Dead Cells,This game is pure genius
Dead Cells,hey atleast they got a person who could play the game
Dead Cells,How did Spelunky 2 get a 10/10 rating and dead cells gets 9.5… lol
Dead Cells,Im Addicted to this Game 😭
Dead Cells,Lapdog
Dead Cells,Is it me or are these type of games better than bigger games thats coming out?
Dead Cells,Very cool game
Dead Cells,What happened to v1?
Dead Cells,What's the soundtrack's name of the first half of the video
Dead Cells,"I'm seeing this ""situation"" in the comments, what happened?"
Dead Cells,ok
Dead Cells,"Wow, this review has me buying the game before the review was over!"
Dead Cells,63 run until you beat the boss... it should've taken you like 15 bro😂
Dead Cells,Who's here after seeing the boomstick review 😆
Dead Cells,He respawns every time he dies that's a pretty interesting set-up
Dead Cells,What happened to v1?
Dead Cells,If this game had a duration played timer it would say forever.
Dead Cells,"Seen the thing on fangamer. seemed interesting, but in the end, doesn’t look like my kinda game."
Dead Cells,"""V2"" HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHHA"
Dead Cells,Love this game so much
Dead Cells,Any guesses as to how many managers reviewed this review before it was allowed to be published?
Dead Cells,Ign has its doosies but damn this review is fantastic so well done
Dead Cells,The Dark Souls of 2D platforming
Dead Cells,Anyone remember that song Deadcell by Papa Roach? No ok😑
Dead Cells,Everything about this game is art.... even the box and the insert paper.. beautiful on a pro
Dead Cells,This game is kinda bad ngl
Dead Cells,blackheads
Dead Cells,I glad it beat Hollow Knight with 9.5 :D
Dead Cells,Does anyone have a link to the original video?
Dead Cells,Im pretty happy they are finally making changes in IGN
Dead Cells,A game journalist that actually played the game. Amazing
Dead Cells,"Tried to get my stepdad to try it out, he's an old-school person with a lot of hard opinions on the games he chooses to play, and he wouldn't even give this one the time of day. Sad."
Dead Cells,Who's who's playing on your mobile now
Dead Cells,Sounds like the reviewer really wanted to use all the flowery descriptions he learned from college writing classes. Annoying.
Dead Cells,Dammm
Dead Cells,What happened and why is it v2?
Dead Cells,"Lol v2, I forgot about that plagerisn fiasco until this popped up on my recommendations"
Dead Cells,I beat the final boss on my 3rd run
Dead Cells,IMO it looks more like a Gameboy Advance game than a Switch game. Although it looks fun.
Dead Cells,How do I get back to where I got killed
Dead Cells,The first review where IGN is right about something
Dead Cells,I enjoy your reviews I'm a subscriber to your channel and great job
Dead Cells,I'm going to get mine this week I have the switch lite i love Nintendo
Dead Cells,Major spoilers
Dead Cells,Oil grenade and pyrotechnics make for the best cheese
Dead Cells,Can someone explain what ign did in the first version to me?
Dead Cells,Newbie gamer here. Never played much of anything at all. I decided to start with this game and I hate gaming now :D . I'm on my 40 something run and got to the final boss only ONCE and still couldn't beat him. I almost always die during High Peak Castle.
Dead Cells,I played the mobile version first. Then I got it on Xbox game pass and I killed the king on my first run in 1 hour and 1 minute.
Dead Cells,63 runs for last boss on normal difficulty...meanwhile a normal person does it in 5 runs....
Dead Cells,one of the best games i've played in a really long time.
Dead Cells,How’d this this get one more point then hollow knight
Dead Cells,Derivative and forced. And don't get me started on the game.
Dead Cells,Why the game had no lvls ? No stages
Dead Cells,It is on sale now and I'm wondering if I should take the plunge.
Dead Cells,"For me, the best game ever, almost 500 hours and im not a manco 😁"
Dead Cells,This reminds me of dark souls. Seems brutally difficult.
Dead Cells,I wonder what video game donkey would say about this game
Dead Cells,Game pass anyone
Dead Cells,"Who else thinks a piercing cross bow is op, literally could could clear a whole room of enemies in one shot and beat the game when i got the cross bow (7th run)"
Dead Cells,"I'm stuck between getting celeste or dead cells but this reveiw helped alot. Dispite the slight difference in scores, im going for dead cells."
Dead Cells,"This should look amazing, but I feel the same trend in many games, there is little care with overblown visual dynamics, there are so many things exploding, blurring and blooming, that one cannot even begin to appretiate the amazing art style in every character and animation. 
It seems like the handheld game aesthetics of a bazillion neon lights flashing up at any given point of time is ruining many pc games for me. Other than that, amazing game."
Dead Cells,"great great review, score is little too high though..."
Dead Cells,Dead Cells makes you feel like batman..... .
Dead Cells,"Let's ask  Bromstickgaming  what he think about this review 😅😅😅😅😅😅

This game stained the name name of IGN for all of us gamers  ! 

There is no coming back for IGN"
Dead Cells,Thx for copying this review from boomstick
Dead Cells,Sounds vaguely like Christan Bales monologue in American Psycho
Dead Cells,This or hollow Knight?
Dead Cells,Coming to iOS July 17th
Dead Cells,"Hate IGN with a passion I just come on these videos to look at the comments and how badly the reviews are when I’m bored. However they handled this situation very well, and this is quite a decent review. Thumbs up from me. Not everybody at IGN are as bad as I thought."
Dead Cells,So do the cell upgrades and blue prints cross over between runs
Dead Cells,"Dumbshit aside that's happened to this game for being reviewed in the wrong manner, dead cells really is a great game."
Dead Cells,Dead cells is so much fun! great review IGN ☺️👏🎉
Dead Cells,"So much fluff. We get it dude, you speak eloquently, but I feel like you said so much yet told me nothing."
Dead Cells,What about u can't even play the game on ps4 the game keeps crashing after 5 seconds from lunching the game
Dead Cells,Wait you got to the final boss on the 2nd run and beat it on 63rd the hell its been 18 hours and I can barely get to the final boss
Dead Cells,"I was just gonna send the link to the Boomstick Gaming vid but i guess there is no need no more"
Dead Cells,All your effort put in and the reward is a complete letdown for an ending
Dead Cells,better than the verge handle their mistake
Dead Cells,Now that 1.2 is out we need a v3 review
Dead Cells,i think u like this game
Dead Cells,Déjà-vu I've seen this review before. Somewhere else.
Dead Cells,Why is this version 2? What happened to version 1?
Dead Cells,Still lower than fortnite
Dead Cells,This second review of Dead Cells really makes you FEEL like you're watching a remade review.
Dead Cells,Got to the final boss on your second run? Really?
Dead Cells,I'm satisfied you gave it a 9.5 but I give it a 10. If it weren't for the Binding of Isaac this would be the best indie game I've ever played
Dead Cells,Oh yeah yeah
Dead Cells,But does it make you FEEL like a dead cell?
Dead Cells,*63 runs later*
Dead Cells,Dunkey should play this
Dead Cells,Ver.2 I WONDER WHY
Dead Cells,"not copying this one, are you?"
Dead Cells,*v2*
Dead Cells,"It shouldn’t say “V2” it should say “IGN Version”
I don’t hate you, I’m an IGN crew member on GTA Online 😁"
Dead Cells,wtf is a rogue light metroidvania?
Dead Cells,"This game is like ninja gaiden, mega man and contra fused together"
Dead Cells,The game is also surprisingly good on mobile.  I beat the game a few times on Playstation and was able to beat it in about 10 tries on mobile.
Dead Cells,Just got Dead Cells for iOS! Fantastic find!
Dead Cells,"For any playstation players, dead cells is currently completly free on ps extra, no reason not to try it if you have extra, it only takes 2.5 gbs."
Dead Cells,I love this game. It deserves all the praises.
Dead Cells,I always wanted to buy the Game but i never bring myself to untill a week ago. Its so damn amazing and im glad i bought it. I bought the Full package with all DLCs in a Bundle for very cheap.. Its so good that devs keep updating and releasing new content frequently. I have more fun with this game and with Vampire Survivors than with any AAA game in the past 3 years...
Dead Cells,"Always nice to see new players coming to this game 5 years after launch. Only the best games can achieve this kind of longevity.
Developers also did a fantastic job at releasing a new DLC every year."
Dead Cells,Dead Cells is the game that is really easy to get addicted to but if you quit its really hard to come back to.
Dead Cells,"4:05 that made me physically recoil.
All you need to do is roll to the other side when he screams and activate  his shield."
Dead Cells,"0:11 From some screenshots I've seen, it seems to have a minimap that reminds me of metroidvanias. Might buy it at some point, though, not riht now"
Dead Cells,Boys haha i got it for free on ipad dead cells+ but srsly pls buy the game before getting it for 100% free
Dead Cells,Gamepass for it is free
Dead Cells,Dead cells rules so much. I’ve probably done like…. 400+ runs and I’m still ready for more always. Btw I really hope you beat the game since this video came out 3 months ago :-)
Dead Cells,YES.  AND EVERY DLC. YOU WON'T REGRET IT
Dead Cells,"""It's essentially button mashing"".  This is why you haven't made it beyond the first boss in 0bc, my dude."
Dead Cells,"Good review, after you beat the late game boss, you unlock a whole new difficulty called boss cells. the boss cells escalate until 5. each boss cell gets more weapon blueprints, gold an cells. But the enemies will hit harder and health flasks become more rare. Biome selection becomes very important and you have to know how to pull off builds. Learn to adapt to all colors. They all have diffrent playstyles and can melt bosses if played right. My suggestion is to take a look at some weapons that are versetile and try to obtain them while on lower difficulties so you don't struggle as much.Don't be afraid to turn up the difficulty. you will get used to it eventually. There is no impossible enemy in the game, they all have way to be tackled.Even on higher boss cell levels, you can still make mistakes here and there. The community is very friendly from what I have seen. Try asking for builds, or even take a look at psychie's runs, he is very expirenced at the game. You also need to know which path leads to where,  and which boss do you want to fight."
Dead Cells,"I am glad you are enjoying the game but I want to give some tips idk if you got updated on build info or this is old footage. These tips are also for anyone reading. To make getting into the game a bit easier.

First whenever possible invest into 1 stat color (your weapon’s color) and build around this. Damage is logarithmic which means it scales like crazy once you get more scrolls. 

Two don’t be afraid to check out some more dead cells videos salmon feet put out a good dead cells build video guide 

Three don’t be afraid to have fun. it’s a hard game and  later boss cells (difficulty modes) are brutal. But everything is viable once your good enough. The devs aim for this balance. Don’t feel encouraged to play 5bc if you don’t want to or discouraged to play with aspects or custom mode. It’s your game have fun. 

I hope you have fun with this game"
Dead Cells,"I actually finished the game last spring. As soon as I finished I was like: yep, this is my favorite game of all time"
Dead Cells,It’s horrible. There’s a reason everyone stopped playing.
Dead Cells,"1:10 First off, the game GoG version does not take my controller, had to add it to Steam so I am able to use the Steam controller support. Also the analoge stick feels REALLY BAD with this. Other games feel good, like Metroid Dread as example, but this one here... not. The character has 2 different speeds he can run at and therefore you always going to push it left or right hard anyway.
This is fixed pretty much by setting the game up so it uses the digital pad for moving around. It might be me, but I don't like this with analogue sticks."
Dead Cells,I mean it's getting Castlevania dlc so why not buy it? Unless it's bad.
Dead Cells,i just got it on apple arcade and it’s honestly really fun when youre just bored and whip it out and just play i guess
Dead Cells,Me has dead cells on the Nintendo gets 5bc in 2 weeks
Dead Cells,“It scratches an itch I didn’t know I had” that is exactly what it did to me too!!!
Dead Cells,"What is the appeal of perma death and no check points? The only appeal I can imagine is for the uber video game nerds who play so much and are so hardcore that they are slavering for the challenge. But that market is super niche and doesn't explain why every new game these days is a rogue-like or rogue-lite. I feel like I'm an average gamer who plays a few hours per week, tucked in between job, husband and father duties. The last thing I want is a game to kick my ārse and punish me for not being a savant or for only spending a few hours a week on games. So what gives with these games with perma deaths and no check points? Why can't the dāmn developers just give the option to toggle those things on or off? Problem solved. Everyone is happy."
Dead Cells,I play on my cellphone and it works to buy the full version 🔥
Dead Cells,"Yes, won't watch the video but the answer is yes. New dlc dropping 6th of March."
Dead Cells,The guide skin from terraria got me good
Dead Cells,"It's a great game, I've been quite addicted to it lately."
Dead Cells,"Heck yeah, got this on iPad on Apple Arcade and play it with a controller and it’s dope af, took me about a month of practice before I began to push the buttons with real intent and not just mash them approximately! Now I got 2 BC and it feels like the real game has started, good luck everyone"
Dead Cells,Why a week before 2023?
Dead Cells,"Picked up a used physical copy for the Switch for $22.99.  Having an absolute blast with this game.  It's as if Hades and Metroid had an angry one night stand and this is what came from it.  Difficult, but not make you throw the controller difficult.  I've beaten the Concierge several times and the big eyeball boss(can't remember the name) once, and am loading up the weapons and mutations.  Good stuff."
Dead Cells,I’ve been considering getting it for my switch but I just don’t know.
Dead Cells,"Oh you don't even know yet, but there is no end... The end is only the beginning to harder modes."
Dead Cells,"""Game is meant to you to die"" 3:01 - 3:02
Meanwhile have only died a few times so far, but in most cases, it was because l did not yet have a level two healing flask at last, or better stuff to start it. Honestly, after you unlock Mutation and all the random weapon upgrades, it's walking in the park after that. 

Like literally you just get the blood tea drinker, or whatever, and go for bleed build, and can sure you, you will win the entire game unless you so how just get rekt yourself by being too cocky or taking the wrong stat upgrade or just getting one shot, (Hard difficulty experience be like) There is no way you literally could loose in the game.

But honestly? the game is very good, after 17 hours straight playing it, l can say it's a very good, Challenging aspect? eh.. its okay, as long you learn the patterns and how stats work, your good to go.

(Also can someone please change the freaking video game title from Kingdoms and Castles to Dead Cell's? Good lord its been 2 weeks and still having the wrong game title)"
Dead Cells,you get so many views but only 367 subscribers? how come no ones subbing? you make great content!
Dead Cells,is this cocaine?
Dead Cells,dead cells is one of my favorite games of all time tbh this shit is so good
Dead Cells,"I absolutely love this game. Out it down, well put my switch down just because of life for over a year+. Picked it up again and resurrected my switch yesterday. OMG. I missed this so much. And i dont remember how long it took me to beat it the first time. I know it had to do with enormous luck. I had the ice blast and some legendary weapon. So freeze smash and repeat. 😂. Im yet to replicate that run. But yes a masterpiece. And i havent even unlocked nearly every weapon or anything. Glad i found your channel. Looking forward to it."
Dead Cells,Took me quite the time to do boss rush no hit.
Dead Cells,I can’t wait for the Castlevania dlc
Dead Cells,Dead cells > all rogue like games . Goat game
Dead Cells,Yes. This game is masterpiece. Like hollow knight or ori series.
Dead Cells,"Since I am a Dead Cells player the algorithm showed me your video, I hope you get more subs! Even when it was a quick video I enjoyed it, super clean audio and good editing. Hope you cover the new DLC Return to Castlevania once it is out!"
Dead Cells,"i installed the game one week ago and i manged to finish the game on the first Difficulty after 60 runs i guess 
i felt always if i was improving 
after the first 15 runs i learned how to get to the doors in time 
and after 20 runs i learned how to get always 30 kill on the first stage 
and after that i manged to learn how to get both 
 but there is some luck enovlving to be honest and i still suck at using shields lol 
but i don't think it's that hard compared to noita ( i spent 367 runs nad 89 hours to finish this game once ! )"
Dead Cells,Better believe got notifications for here to
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Lol the reviewer sounds like kermit the frog
Crypt of the Necrodancer,your video is too quiet lol
Crypt of the Necrodancer,80% on steam right now.. buy it. It's a steal
Crypt of the Necrodancer,How is this dude saying “um” so much when he’s not actually even playing the game?!
Crypt of the Necrodancer,For anyone on the fence right now with a switch: it is $3.99 right now. Almost nothing to lose.
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Who here because of Hyrule Cadence
Crypt of the Necrodancer,I came here to hear how this game plays. But it was hard to hear through. Need a better script and like let the video match up and not just filler.
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Buying this for sure .
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Looks hard
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Is that lumpy space princess doing the commentary?!😂😂
Crypt of the Necrodancer,takes away 1.2 points for their own mmistakes and bad conservation ahhh ign
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"And now you can spent diamonds to buy some stuff before you begin the run, so yeah, this game is perfect now!;)"
Crypt of the Necrodancer,يا برمة وام اللحم يا برمة نصفك شحم
Crypt of the Necrodancer,this and isaac is pretty much all I play
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"8.8
Too much beat
*IGN*"
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Link?
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"Wow that looks awesome, the trailer is one of the best Ive seen in a while."
Crypt of the Necrodancer,7.8/10 too much water 
Crypt of the Necrodancer,this game came out a year ago lol late much ign
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Finally something new
Crypt of the Necrodancer,I thought the image for this video was female version of Link 0_o
Crypt of the Necrodancer,why the hell would this get doslikes? its a kool mechanic
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Best. Rhythm. Game. EVAAAAAAAAAAARRRRR!!!!!!!
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Third 
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"Senseless and irrational ""indie hate"" in 3....2....1.."
Crypt of the Necrodancer,first
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Despite all the uniqueness. This game is so hard to learn though.
Crypt of the Necrodancer,a game about music and rhythm with anything less than 30 tracks is awful
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Good review
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Automatic like for the Dayman song
Crypt of the Necrodancer,i instantly recognized the mgrr music lol
Crypt of the Necrodancer,You gotta pay the troll toll.
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"I found this game because of the collab with this and Zelda, I absolutely adore Cadence of Hyrule and plan on getting this in the future."
Crypt of the Necrodancer,I had that same keyboard for a long time. Good times. :)
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Is this what inspired BPM: Bullets Per Minute?
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"Great review, i bought the game a moment ago! 
When you said i can put some Hotline Miami (Perturbator) music in, i was sold.
In The Binding of Isaac, i have a mod which has Perturbator music, and it's also Rouge-like, so this is a win! c:"
Crypt of the Necrodancer,I bought a dance pad for this game. It's a helluva lot of fun.
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"""Pleth Aura"" are my middle names..."
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"Holly shit, what the hell it that keyboard!?!"
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"I notice all of the game's songs and even the ones you used as example have a 4/4 meters. I kinda wonder whether the game is able to handle other meters such as 3/4, let alone irregular ones such as 5/4 or 7/8 (this'd make the game substantially more challenging)."
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"Oh my god, you did not just import the Night Man song. This is my first time watching one of your videos, and I love you."
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Lol hotline Miami ost. Good review buddy
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"George, please make a video review on Cadence of Hyrule! Love this review, and want to know your opinion on the new one! Cheers!"
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Just got this for the switch on sale for $4.  I thought the Legend of Zelda was a DLC for the game.  Come to find out it's a separate game for $25.  I'm enjoying it especially with the Danganronpa skins.
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Please review the sequel to this game
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"I love this game but it needs a sequel in 3d with mocapped dance moves. Think of how Nightmare or Mitsurugi move in Soul Calibur and imagine that as an actual synthwave dungeon crawler.


Yes I've seen the Voldo Dance."
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"8-20 hours of playtime seems a bit low, considering its meant to be played as a roguelike. If your going through floors one by one, then that seems right. But the real casual endpoint is to beat all 4 floors in a row as the main character, which is likely more than 30 hours. Anyone who enjoys the isaac style should expect that, and expect to have fun doing the same thing with a few of the more difficult characters. I was a fairly casual isaac player, I put about 100 hours into it, and I put just as much into this game as well. It has more depth than this review puts on it, even though I agree with the review in pretty much every way."
Crypt of the Necrodancer,CUSTOM MUSIC?? Now I kinda want pc over the switch version
Crypt of the Necrodancer,DAY MAN! Ahhhahahhhh
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"Whore games? Lol
It looks interesting as with Zelda now. Ill probably play it if I'm alive in about 3 years or so? I still need to catch up with Skyward Sword and Breath of The Wild."
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Plethora means too many
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"Came from the future due to the Zelda Necromancer. Your review is amazing. <3
Looking forward to this game as a Zelda variant and more of your reviews!"
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Who else playing this before the new game?
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"It may be Amplified (DLC), but it's never really felt feasable to ignore the beat for me. Since it has a small coyote time after a missed beat (0.25 seconds or so)        for you to make up for a missed beat, it always _completely_ screws up my rythem to skip a beat. Much better to just dig/buffer and let the enemies get closer."
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"I completely dont agree that those old shit games controls were on purpuse. They were shit because technology, they were shit because developers. Definetly not because they were supposed to.. That fucking stupid"
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"Personally, I preferred it with a gamepad, slamming XYAB buttons with my thumb, they're more cardinal and just feel more, uh, slammable."
Crypt of the Necrodancer,I love it
Crypt of the Necrodancer,I've watched about a dozen reviews for this game. For whatever reason this is the one that got me to buy it.
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"6:05 ""A couple of late-game enemies can move diagonally, which you will never be able to do""

*Then comes out the DLC with Diamond*

Never say never~"
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"Rewatching this review, I now have  hundreds of hours in Necrodancer and one of the only things I disagree with is the balance issues. If it wasn't for the very hard gameplay, I probably would've stopped playing after I beat it the first time. Haven't cleared a full run with Aria yet, but I'm close."
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"It is way too freaking hard, especially when you move towards the later third of the main story. I'm like 35 hours into the game and still can't beat it.
I would argue that Crypt of the Necrodancer is more difficult than Dark Souls and FURI on FURIER.
By far the most difficult game I've ever played. It stops being fun when you can't seem to make any progress after dozens of hours."
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Well...you say Hotline Miami is a treat....so why did you play a clip with Furi music afterwards
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"""When your cornered, alone, under equipped with nowhere left to dance to."" A game where saying this makes sense is a game worth playing at least once."
Crypt of the Necrodancer,4:30 Or the tracks from FURI. Pretty much everything from Danger or Carpenter Brut.
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"Unfortunate the game isn't complex enough to really work with songs that aren't of a totally consistent beat. That rules out pretty much everything but club/rave electric music. Ah well. This looks kind of amazing, and the fact it's local co-op is very, very surprising. I bet this is hilarious and fun with a friend."
Crypt of the Necrodancer,The custom music got me tho
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Thank you for the death scream at the end; it would've killed me not knowing whether you survived that last hit or not.
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Thought you were using a text-to-speech program at first lol
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Dayman!
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"necrodancer was what partially got me into speedrunning :D.
that said does anyone find it hard to play necrodancer for like more than 30 or an hour? the game is really draining on my brain with the music and constant decision making."
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"As a roguelike player ""dredmore style tile dungeon""  is offensive."
Crypt of the Necrodancer,When a rhythm game has a more exciting combat system than every single AAA game of the last few years.
Crypt of the Necrodancer,You should play this with Bands like Tool in the Background. I wonder what this games playes like with odd times
Crypt of the Necrodancer,the intuitiveness of WASD lmao gtfooh lol. i been using pc for years and WASD will never be intuitive. pc elitest fanboy reviwer lol
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Anybody who says Necrodancer is a good game gets a Like from me :D
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"""You will never be able to move diagonally.""
They added a new character with the DLC that lets you do exactly that. Best character ever."
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Every game should have Roller Mobster in it
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"With the approach of the Full Release of the DLC, do you plan to return to necrodancer?"
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"maybe it's just me but i found the game easy
except when it's unfair(ish)
i just put on my headphones and I'm ready to rock"
Crypt of the Necrodancer,What song is at 3:51?
Crypt of the Necrodancer,4:35 HACKNET OST I LOVE THEM SONGS
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"""far more compicated than just following a button prompt""

Do a no miss run of Max Period and get back to me on that one ^^"
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"crypt of the necrodancer with hotline miami soundtrack????!! 
I'm off to steam!"
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"3:51

SOLD. GIVE ME THE GAME NOW."
Crypt of the Necrodancer,The 1970's called; they want their keyboard back.
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Challenge mode?  There  isn't one
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"Necrodancing to carpenter brut totally earned my subscription. I wish I could do that on the PS4.
Nice channel! Keep it up!"
Crypt of the Necrodancer,What song were you using at 4:35?
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"you say the bow is up. but by the community, it's in the F-that tier lool"
Crypt of the Necrodancer,playing zone 4 with aria is s´such a huge challenge
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"That Dayman bit just earned you a sub, my friend.  I'm fucking in tears"
Crypt of the Necrodancer,How do we know you don't just like this game for its never-ending bunny hopping?
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Aced that ending!
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Playing this with Danganronpa music is divine.
Crypt of the Necrodancer,I picked this up a month ago... I don't think they ever nerfed Zone 4.
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Resident Evil was made hard to control on purpose? I'd have to see a citation on that.
Crypt of the Necrodancer,I. LOVE. Crypt of the Necrodancer. Might be my favorite game.
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"3:52
WINDS OF DESTRUCTION"
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Can you upload MP3's on the PS4 version through the system and/or Spotify?
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"I know that this review is an year old but you can change the controls of the game. For example, I play with movement on WASD and items usage on Q, E, R, F, C, and X (instead of the Up + Down or other directional nonsense)."
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"Hey there, I was wondering, I know you play a lot of games, and obviously you don't have time for every game a fan recommends you, but there is a really fun local co-op dungeon crawling game on Steam called Crawl. It's still in early access I'm aware, but the amount of fun I've had with my friends was well worth the price, and I can't wait for even more additions to the game. If you ever get the chance somehow, give it a try, I'd love to hear your critique on it."
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"If I get this game, I'm importing some 8-bit remixes for sure."
Crypt of the Necrodancer,I am sure I would be completely annoyed by this gameplay after a few minutes
Crypt of the Necrodancer,The Nightman Cometh!!!!
Crypt of the Necrodancer,I wanna play this to death grips
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"Sorry to ask but, what's the song at 3:59? sounds incredible. Other than that your review makes me want to buy this game. I've been seeing gameplays and hearing the soundtrack and I'm convinced this game is for me."
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"Damn it, now I have to buy this just to play it with Rules of Nature."
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"I am downloading it now, and I really want to know how well *Breakcore* will fit. Or not... :)"
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"Oh, I really like the idea of this game and I enjoyed the gameplay to a degree... but then it hit me... I hated the music. Not because its bad but simply because I don't enjoy the style of music it goes for. And after another half hour, I had to quit because... I couldn't stand the music anymore. Good game but  I just can't get beyond my taste here."
Crypt of the Necrodancer,I wonder how well this game would work with Tech Death Metal.
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"It's great to hear Danny's music again.


EDIT: I just heard Roller Mobster, save my soul from this amazingness."
Crypt of the Necrodancer,sorry dude but controls were bad because of technical limitations and experimentation into 3D. a good game is a good game. not because it has bad controls.
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Day Man
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Fighter of the Night Man
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"basically your mentioning an issue with the game balance, when actually you are just bad at the game as evidenced by the last section where instead of moving side to side avoiding all danger you dance in and out of the insta kill.

if you don't want to get overwhelmed by enemies don't yolo your way through the game. It's the same with every other roguelike, you have to take each step carefully.

even if you don't have any discernible sense of rhythm there are still options for you."
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"The game's rythm based gameplay reminds me of Patapon, and that's good!"
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"Nice choice of custom music bro!
NIGHT MAN"
Crypt of the Necrodancer,it's cool that new genres of game can still be made by combining older genres
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"5:52 ""It seems far to pheasable to ignore the beat""
WHOA WHOA WHOA.
Have you even Aria mode?"
Crypt of the Necrodancer,this game sucks
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"8-20 hours? Try 250+ :) And most of that was from before launch, so there was only the Danny B soundtracks."
Crypt of the Necrodancer,Buying this right now!!! Cnt wait to play this to Transitor's soundtrack!
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"Realizes its a Roguelike, complains about potentially exploitative mechanics and random elements."
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"I'm late to the party, but I'm hard pressed to find anything unfair about this game. Enemies who move diagonally can still be evaded by simply moving back from them. Ranged weapons can get you stuck in an area that's inopportune, due to the said range. With this being put on the table, Zone 4 doesn't need a nerf in the slightest I feel. Maybe the amount of warlocks that spawn could be changed, but that's only a thought.

In any case, this review was really well done and I'd love to see more."
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"DAYMAN
10/10 It's Always Subscribe in Philadelphia"
Crypt of the Necrodancer,My gripe with the game is that the rhythm is hard to read. I played for a while and I still don't know whether I'm supposed to hit the key/start jump at the beat or my character should land at the beat. It's a fraction of a second but I'm a very musically inclined person and tiny discrepancies between the beat and what I'm seeing really bothers me. Good and original game nonetheless.
Hotline Miami,"When they said katana zero is like hotline miami I didn't think katana zero really would be just like hotline miami. That said, probably my next purchase"
Hotline Miami,I literally watch this before I but this game next week on Steam Summer Sale. I knew this game before but I completely forgot it and thanks to this video my love for the previously unknown game made my love for it to resurrect😇
Hotline Miami,On Vita it is one of the best gaming experiences EVER. But surely it would be great played on anything. THE SOUNDTRACK!!!!!!!
Hotline Miami,Can't watch this video without giving google my ID or credit card. Maybe because of the video description?
Hotline Miami,*me watching this review even though i have beaten this game 3 times* : interesting
Hotline Miami,"Unpopular opinion, this game is worse than Getting Over It"
Hotline Miami,"“Like most cocaine fueled rampages, it’s short lived, but memorable” lol this guy knows what’s up"
Hotline Miami,"I absolutely LOVE this game! The entire atmosphere & fucked up world that is presented is amazingly contrasted by the colorful & euphoric 80s vibe the game has. One thing I always loved was the empty feeling you get whenever you complete an adrenaline-filled level, only for the music to completely cut out & leave you in silence."
Hotline Miami,"Came here after seeing....
You know"
Hotline Miami,"Really good game, although the computer controls are kinda hard to master."
Hotline Miami,This is a disturbingly somber game
Hotline Miami,i love this game
Hotline Miami,2019 Anyone who just got a vita lately and finished the game?
Hotline Miami,I take back what I said. Hotline Miami is a great game.
Hotline Miami,Someone loves cocaine 🤔
Hotline Miami,I never once asked myself if the gameplay experience in hotline Miami was a drug induce dream....
Hotline Miami,Wheres the rating
Hotline Miami,"I beat it in just under 3 hours, best 3h of my gaming life"
Hotline Miami,This game has made me break 2 tv's and I still love it
Hotline Miami,"ey, havent buyed it yet? Havent played it yet? Just STFU, go buy, go play and please.. for the love of god.. buy yourself a good headsett! this game is awesome and so is the music!"
Hotline Miami,It's true that only a satanic civilization would allow something like this to be available. I wouldn't wanna be you when the time comes.
Hotline Miami,"Not gonna lie, the main reason I love this game is because it reminds me of my first game, GTA 2. And the soundtrack is spot on."
Hotline Miami,"didnt like the gameplay at all. the enemies have the reflexes of a cheetah and the 1 shot kills are just too much for me. i like the style of the game a lot, but dying like 40x on a level is just not fun. wish they came up with another way to make the game challenging aside from enemies that are all ninjas."
Hotline Miami,haven't played this game yet but the soundtrack is awesome!
Hotline Miami,"Love this game so fucking much that I have 1&2 on Vita, Ps3 and Ps4!!!"
Hotline Miami,This game is glorious
Hotline Miami,People praise and love a game I personally hate in every way. While I just sit here sad that not many people know Dust An Elysian Tail or Ori And The Blind Forest
Hotline Miami,whats the song at the start of the review
Hotline Miami,just picked this up for 2 bucks it's pretty great
Hotline Miami,Best shooting mechanics since Doom.
Hotline Miami,"Sick ,twisted, and a soundtrack worth buying... Simply great"
Hotline Miami,What's the difference between this and Hatred?
Hotline Miami,"Does the reviewer not remind of you the ""Irish"" guy at the start of Bioshock"
Hotline Miami,this games great! I got a phone call and went murdering everyone then I started playing the game
Hotline Miami,STEAM SALE
Hotline Miami,What do you mean? I love the story.
Hotline Miami,This game is sic 
Hotline Miami,I've had runny faeces trickle down my leg that looks better than this game.
Hotline Miami,Is this game only for PC or is it for consoles as well for ps3 ?
Hotline Miami,This game rocks on the vita
Hotline Miami,"I sort of wish this games had some rogue like elements. While I still want a story, maybe they could make a mode similar to Nuclear Throne. "
Hotline Miami,9 for me.
Hotline Miami,Thumbs up for MOON 
Hotline Miami,This game runs slower on my computer like in pure slomo so i have only died 7 tiems.
Hotline Miami,"Entire soundtrack. Enjoy. Just log in to spotify.

http://open.spotify.com/user/1224606294/playlist/3HLMmCcl83B8u23ASFxFCQ"
Hotline Miami,What's the song at 3:28
Hotline Miami,steam sales bitches 
Hotline Miami,There is no way to describe this game other than it's a lot of fun with a great soundtrack
Hotline Miami,"This game is honestly a piece of art. It's beautiful. Even if you despise endless, mindless bloodshed, the 1980's vibe just carried me through this game from start to finish. Music, visuals, atmosphere- very well crafted. If you like stuff like Scarface, GTA Vice City etc this game is for you."
Hotline Miami,"Games like this make me glad I got PS+
I would have never given it a chance if it wasn't free. Now I can't wait for HM2."
Hotline Miami,It sucks
Hotline Miami,"Great, simple and fun.  
Too many game developers believe that graphics make a game, while this game really disproves that. 

I have to say that they must have ironed out most of the technical issues as I've played this game for around 6 hours now with no crashes to report.

Maybe I just suck at the game, but I've died large amounts of time and the feeling of satisfaction after getting through levels is enormous. I'm also wondering whether the neighbours will come banging on my door to wonder what I keep screaming about..

Great game. It's only 1.5 Euros on steam now, so definitely pick it up."
Hotline Miami,"how can you glorify a game like this? much less say nice things about it? our world is messed up...yes i play some violent games, but that game has a reason to be...last of us for surival, gears of war to protect your soiciety...this game though it gloryifying murder just for fun, this is a rare case that i can see video games creating a monster"
Hotline Miami,Gamepad fully supported now.  I played with an X360 controller and had no issues at all.
Hotline Miami,Love this game. Got the soundtrack on my iphone too. so cool
Hotline Miami,Release for the Dreamcast! 
Hotline Miami,"2-3 hours? It took me 5 and I thought I was doing an okay job haha,"
Hotline Miami,How the hell is this game 16+ ?
Hotline Miami,"I really disagree on the point that it ""doesn't care about justification"", if you look at the questions that are asked of you by the mysterious animal figures (not just ""do you enjoy hurting people"") it serves to examine the entire concept of justification in games. it explores why we perform brutal acts in games and just how easily even the thinnest narrative can get us in the mindset to virtually slaughter"
Hotline Miami,"It is better for pc, unless u don't care about 1080p"
Hotline Miami,shoyld i get this for pc or get a vita then this
Hotline Miami,This is on sale on Steam right now £1.74
Hotline Miami,Vita version is sick. Had no idea I would like this so much
Hotline Miami,Free on PS Plus
Hotline Miami,one of the best games i have played :)
Hotline Miami,"This game is so amazing, it might be a breakthrough in gaming. I believe we have in Hotline Miami, the first arthouse video game."
Hotline Miami,The only way to truly appreciate this game is to play it the way it was meant to be played - high.
Hotline Miami,"couldn't agree more! I got it last week not expecting much. its now my favorite vita game by far! also, coming from gamer who never dabbles in  indie games i now have much more respect for them and look forward to many more."
Hotline Miami,that would be awesome!!!
Hotline Miami,"That's the games soundtrack, you have to ask the developers."
Hotline Miami,It's insane how good this is on the Vita
Hotline Miami,Great review for an incredible game.
Hotline Miami,"Great review, love this game."
Hotline Miami,Works best on Vita. Touch targeting.
Hotline Miami,can i get that last 30 seconds as a full length song
Hotline Miami,"Just got this, fucking epic game! "
Hotline Miami,Yes cheap on Steam.

Hotline Miami,It's like a game of the fight scenes from Drive.
Hotline Miami,"This game is like a dream, a very dark and deliciously twisted dream."
Hotline Miami,This game is so addictive. 
Hotline Miami,Bring to ps3/Vita next Keyboard drumkit fucking warewolf
Hotline Miami,"It is cross buy. It just launched a few days ago.

Hotline Miami,"for those who are interested in this game it is on sale at gog.com for $3.33. I would grab it, it is a good game"

Hotline Miami,So Hotline Miami is better than The Last Of Us. The numbers don't lie Gamespot....
Hotline Miami,"Stoked that this is coming to PS3 and Vita. And I think it's cross-buy too, which is a huge plus."
Hotline Miami,YES! Do you have a PS3? If you do you get that version for free.
Hotline Miami,hotline miami 2!!!!
Hotline Miami,"this game got me mind fuck
"
Hotline Miami,Bro never played manhunt
Hotline Miami,shut up and appreciate the art
Hotline Miami,free advertising
Hotline Miami,not as disturbing as that chin strap
Hotline Miami,If missing the point was a professional sport this reviewer won the Olympics gold.
Hotline Miami,"git gud lul, ur aim just sux."
Hotline Miami,this game is up there with postal 2
Hotline Miami,dumbass
Hotline Miami,He complains about the things that makes the game amazing
Hotline Miami,tip:change careers
Hotline Miami,"""Hotline miami really tricks you into thinking its gonna be kinda cute""
My brother in christ, the poster art literally has a mutilated corpse on it"
Hotline Miami,i love how most of his criticism is either him being really bad at the game or genuinely great points of design like having to walk back through the mess you caused.
Hotline Miami,If Hotline Miami is disturbing then you haven't seen Manhunt or Postal.
Hotline Miami,i'm pretty sure this was a sarcastic review
Hotline Miami,"""Techno"" I'M CRYIBG 💀"
Hotline Miami,This guy is incomprehensible.
Hotline Miami,"my guy didnt understand the game at all😭everything he said he didnt like is what makes it great. The quick paranoid controls and repeated death, the over-saturation of color, music, and violence all play into the message of this game. the message of the game went over so many peoples’ heads"
Hotline Miami,Tell me the game is to hard for you without telling me it's too hard for you.
Hotline Miami,tip: if you weren't a dumbass you would realize that the game questions you for killing all those people.
Hotline Miami,Cope lol
Hotline Miami,0:13 Who ever thought this game was cute?!
Hotline Miami,Hotline Miami is the best top-down shooter game of all time.
Hotline Miami,Manhunt: Sure?
Hotline Miami,cope
Hotline Miami,"hey Chris, get a job."
Hotline Miami,(((Kohler)))
Hotline Miami,"if you wanna talk about disturbing games, try postal redux or the original"
Hotline Miami,I hope he never learns about Postal
Hotline Miami,He basically just explained every reason why i love hotline Miami
Hotline Miami,Yeah but it’s really good
Hotline Miami,🤓
Hotline Miami,"seems like a skill issue, get gud scrub."
Hotline Miami,How can you say Hotline Miami is the most disturbing game when Postal exists ?
Hotline Miami,"""this is a unnecessarily rushed explanation""
Dont worry. We can tell"
Hotline Miami,I LOVE KILLING MOBSTERS I LOVE KILLING MOBSTERS
Hotline Miami,Man child.
Hotline Miami,"Cry about that, soy boy.😁"
Hotline Miami,No one told me they switched the definitions of disgusting and awesome
Hotline Miami,cry about it
Hotline Miami,"god, the way he speak are so annoying and I hate hoe his face just take up half area of the screen, I want to see gameplay not your face!"
Hotline Miami,no one let this guy see hatred. his head would explode
Hotline Miami,Soooooooybooooy
Hotline Miami,Bruh
Hotline Miami,"""Techno"" music? 🤣"
Hotline Miami,Satire type woosh beat siri
Hotline Miami,Funny how The Last of US Part 2 paid tribute to this game in a cut scene. And how both games almost run parallel with each other in game play.
Hotline Miami,"Y’all hating but he ain’t wrong.

Hotline Miami is a statement on violence in media and the “disturbing” parts of the game are intentional to really emphasize the actions of the player and really ask “do you like hurting people?”. 

Sure he may come off as an entitled journalist but there is some merit to what he says. Nevertheless hotline Miami is still one of the best examples of a meta commentary on violence and the uses of it in video games and how it reflects on the player."
Hotline Miami,Man baby mumbles gibberish for 3 mints
Hotline Miami,"This entire video seems like a joke, ignore this man baby crying because game is violent."
Hotline Miami,Fat slob
Hotline Miami,"Wired…go F@&k yourselves.
7 years later after this review was made."
Hotline Miami,"A 2nd person narration surrounding the cocaine trade, sleeper agents, USA espionage, and 70s post-soviet counterspies."
Hotline Miami,This man has never played postal
Hotline Miami,"Welcome back to another episode of ""The internet gets triggered by a title and wilfully misinterprets the entire video"""
Hotline Miami,Seethe and mald my friend
Hotline Miami,"I know I'm ~8 years late to say this, but.... Have you ever heard of the Postal series?"
Hotline Miami,Most Disgusting Video Game of All Time? Have you heard of POSTAL?
Hotline Miami,We need a vr Hotline Miami game
Hotline Miami,"Someone needs to show this guy Postal, he'll change his mind very quickly."
Hotline Miami,"""Have a nice cup of herbal tea."" Bro looks like he's gona grab a mountain dew 💀"
Hotline Miami,"If WIRED hates it, you know it has to he great."
Hotline Miami,"People seem to think he didn't like it, but I'd argue he understood the game and that this is a pretty apt explanation without going into details of the story."
Hotline Miami,Who asked for your opinion
Hotline Miami,"He forgot the part where Hotline Miami is the best franchise of all time, with zero flaws or downsides."
Hotline Miami,Gaming journalism folks
Hotline Miami,Sounds like skill issue
Hotline Miami,Hotline Miami has the best story ever and if you can’t look past the violence to see the story you are a fuckwit
Hotline Miami,"You’re not just wrong, you’re stupid"
Hotline Miami,"""like las Vegas""





Bro








THAT IS THE STYLE OF 80S MIAMI"
Hotline Miami,Dude didn’t listen to a single word of the story ig
Hotline Miami,He meant was Hotline Miami is fun the story the characters it's amazing
Hotline Miami,Yeah hotline is an amazing game. Screw you man
Hotline Miami,"I like to return to this video every now and then to remind myself why I hate game ""journalists"" so much."
Hotline Miami,"This is the epitome of “You’re not just wrong, you’re stupid”"
Hotline Miami,lol libbby libby libby
Hotline Miami,this prove that this guy watched 1 minute of gameplay and did a rewiew
Hotline Miami,postal 2
Hotline Miami,Ppl for real lack the comprehension skills to even understand a 2min positive review of the game and interpret it as hate lmao
Hotline Miami,No synthwave
Hotline Miami,goofiest review lmfao
Hotline Miami,"mans said ""it tricks you into thinking it's cute"" dawg  the game opens up with a dude saying ""I'm gonna teach you how to kill people"""
Hotline Miami,He posted cringe
Hotline Miami,It's not that deep
Hotline Miami,Oh boo hoo first the news bitches about postal now hotline Miami
Hotline Miami,Dying is not as scary as it sounds
Hotline Miami,"Mate,you have no business speaking or showing your face on camera,I don't even think you play video games."
Hotline Miami,Manhunt: 😁
Hotline Miami,The best game of all time*
Hotline Miami,No one tell him about manhunt
Hotline Miami,The neckbeard on this fella explains it all...
Hotline Miami,"who do you even have to be to overlook this game's symbolism and story this bad? it doesn't end at just violence, and it should be obvious"
Hotline Miami,"Not watching, dumb title."
Hotline Miami,The whole comment section be hating the video after only reading the title (🤡)
Hotline Miami,"the thing is , that he says it feels like a coke filled drug trip , (spoiler allert)














it is , in hotline miami 2 , the Son overdoses , and beats the level while tripping mad balls."
Hotline Miami,FLOATY. LMAO HE ACTUALLY SAID IT
Hotline Miami,"Why is this comment section somehow spinning a positive, yet exaggeratedly voiced review as if its some sort of bumbling, antagonistic critique? Has no one here spoken to another person before in their entire lives? Or heard of the concept of a bit? He is describing the game in a shocked manner because it is *funny*— he literally praises it as addictive— there is no evidence of any actual disapproval towards the game, yet apparently nobody here is able to read that."
Hotline Miami,I think this is a good review what are y'all on
Hotline Miami,"Pro tip: If a game journalist calls this game pointless violence for violence, then don't trust it because the game is almost a retrospective on video game violence, it basically makes you question what you are doing, it's condemning violence not promoting it."
Hotline Miami,He looks like he doesn’t like good games lmao
Hotline Miami,get good
Sword & Sworcery EP,"i had this on the iPhone 7 ...phone fried and forgot about it. wishlisted for sale pickup just for the soundtrack alone. point and click classic, imo"
Sword & Sworcery EP,"Great review for a fantastic game! I played it back in the days on PC when it was part of an early Humble Bundle and I fell in love with it. Got it on Switch when I saw it was available on the eshop, just in case. It's one of those games you wish you could play for the first time again."
Sword & Sworcery EP,Not really a random find. I bought this game multiple times through Humble Bundles.
Sword & Sworcery EP,"Once you beat this game, if you dont, in the least, take pause to appreciate what you’ve experienced, your soul is dead."
Sword & Sworcery EP,This one is going to the top of the list. Love a well done point click like this. I'm playing the The Last Door now. I can't believe what these artists can achieve with pixels that big!
Sword & Sworcery EP,"Had this for a while, been on my backlog, looks like my sorta game. Flashback/ another world vibes"
Sword & Sworcery EP,I've been wondering about this one everytime I see it on sale. loved The Way Remastered.
Sword & Sworcery EP,"I'm a fan of Point&Click and try to check all the Point&Click on the switch but I missed this one. Thanks for talking about this game, as it is for me, for sure. I liked The Way Remastered and Another World, but you use this comparison only for the graphics, right? Superbrothers doesn't have action, or has it ? For this game to use sound and music in it's gameplay is another positive point for me, as I liked Oxenfree (waiting for the 2 to come out) and even further back Loom 👍"
Sword & Sworcery EP,"I’ll add to the wishlist . Thanks for your review , as always . This looks beautiful."
Sword & Sworcery EP,"I have been seeing this was coming for a while, but was never sure when that would be.  This looked really cool.  Maybe one of the next late night pick ups when the kids won’t let me sleep."
Sword & Sworcery EP,I would REALLY appreciate a Toree 3D review 🐥😎
Sword & Sworcery EP,Is this the first strand type indie game?
Sword & Sworcery EP,"Yeahhhh, booooyyyyy! 
This game's a lo-fi masterpiece.
The ending..."
Sword & Sworcery EP,"Looks pretty cool, gonna put it in the back log. Thank brotha i really enjoy what your doing! There are so many hidden gems i would have missed out on if it wasn't for your channel.  💎💎 🎉👊"
Sword & Sworcery EP,I got this on sale last year but the controls are horrible.  I really wanted to like it but couldn't get past the controls.
Sword & Sworcery EP,"I have been eyeing this one, thanks for the review.  👈👈😉"
Sword & Sworcery EP,"AND HOW DID YOU SKIP OVER FLASHBACK WHEN TALKING ABOUT CINEMATIC PLATFORMERS
ITS LIKE THE CULMINATION OF EVERYTHING GREAT FROM ANOTHER WORLD"
Sword & Sworcery EP,"hey, just because im an ignorant millenial doesnt mean i dont know what EP means!"
Sword & Sworcery EP,"I own some EP's on CD rather than vinyl, I always thought an EP fell somewhere between a single & an album, like say, 5 songs or something. Anyway, I'm not a point & click fan but I love me my music & this looks pretty good for that hilarious sale price - you might have convinced me... again..."
Sword & Sworcery EP,I think you sold me on this one. Thanks!
Sword & Sworcery EP,Did the sale end? shows as 9.99 on US eshop??
Sword & Sworcery EP,I used to play another world on pc back in the nineties. I always thought and still do that it was a great game. But playong it again I remembered how difficult it was... So I didn't go all the way through.
Sword & Sworcery EP,"I have this game and started it a couple times only to move on to another game after a short time with it, guess it's time to give it a full run through since your review gave me inspiration, thanks"
Sword & Sworcery EP,When I first played it on ipad I specifically kept the music tracks after as they were so good
Sword & Sworcery EP,This game is pretty cool. Played it on Steam. I'll still be watching your review though because I dig your style bruh.
Sword & Sworcery EP,"Solid review man! I’ve been debating on buying this game since…. I guess 2011. You sold me bro! (Also the sale price helped but mainly your review). The only negative about this review is you reminded me I’m getting old knowing all about EPs and a thought for a min they were still a thing! Keep up the great work, idk of any other YouTube that can review any random game and still crush it. Doesn’t have to be new or popular but you still manage to make us interested, shit even when it’s a game I already own. Good stuff."
Sword & Sworcery EP,9 years later and I paid $4 for this on Switch
Sword & Sworcery EP,Finally someone adresses what some video games are. An artform in its own right. Beautiful game. Great score
Sword & Sworcery EP,"at 2:28, you misspelled ""Guthrie"" in the captions (you put ""Guthie"")"
Sword & Sworcery EP,"i see your comment to get excited, then it says its a year old, damnit!"
Sword & Sworcery EP,It is alright
Sword & Sworcery EP,It's free right now.
Sword & Sworcery EP,"Yo, got this game from the latest humblebundle and XD I feel so happy right now..."
Sword & Sworcery EP,for god sakes does every review of this game have to start with a brief history that goes off on video game art?
Sword & Sworcery EP,Thi is amazing
Sword & Sworcery EP,"great, I was very interested in this game since the Ipad release but i don't like playing on my laptop, since its not lot a long game i'll give it a try"
Sword & Sworcery EP,"my first thought was, ""reminds me of another world"".

looks very interesting "
Sword & Sworcery EP,"Sometimes it's great to be a pc gamer as well as a console one, especially if you love retro style indie games like me. 
This game looks awesome, in fact i'm going to buy it right now."
Sword & Sworcery EP,"Roughly 5-6 hours, I got it on steam 2 weeks ago and finished it in less than a week. Its short, but its a really good 5-6 hours of gameplay. I really liked the soundtrack too, as well as it's art style."
Sword & Sworcery EP,Very interested in this
Sword & Sworcery EP,still longer than any fps campain

The Artful Escape,This game is outstanding. Especially high.
The Artful Escape,If anyone’s done a life changing amount of lsd then you’ll relate to this medium of art that much more.
The Artful Escape,"Gameplay let’s this game down badly. However the soundtrack, graphics, optics, characters and rhythm is an absolute joy. 

I’m enjoying the experience but frustrated by the short music battles. 

Other than that enjoy the experience, it’s masterful."
The Artful Escape,"If you want a beautiful visual experience then this is what the ""game"" offers, other than that the gameplay is extremely simple and boring, more if you know how to play guitar, pressing 5 buttons again and again with the same notes is extremely lame."
The Artful Escape,he walks funny but this looks intriguing
The Artful Escape,"The wordsmithing on this review deserves a standing ovation of its own. Take a bow, Tristan!"

The Artful Escape,let's fill this review with alliteration it wont be annoying and jarring at all for sure
The Artful Escape,Maybe I'm just old and cynical now but this game was boring af
The Artful Escape,This game took my breath away from the beginning to the end ..... what a joy to play. It really got me at an astonishing emotional level.
The Artful Escape,"Damn the combination of music and storytelling this game, actually made me tear up a couple times, not to mention the amazing voice acting, with the great addition of Carl Weathers"
The Artful Escape,"- Looks like a guiter-version of Wandersong with really great graphics and style
- Same publisher as Outer Wilds (Annapurna Interactive)

Added to wishlist 😄"
The Artful Escape,"This game is truly something wonderful, already from the menu you know it will be something special. Really recommend it to everyone."
The Artful Escape,Y’all’s sound ratio is garbage
The Artful Escape,Game started out strong. But went on for too long and got WAY too repetitive. 7.5/10.
The Artful Escape,"This game deserved a 9 at least for its uniqueness, literally a space opera!"
The Artful Escape,Playing it now in the series x this game is amazing
The Artful Escape,Just finished this. Absolutely loved it *Gamepass ta*
The Artful Escape,One of the most beautiful games I've ever played.  Its incredible
The Artful Escape,"An orgasm of color. This game shows off the resolution, graphical fidelity & color palate of Series X gen hardware incredibly. It is pure eye candy. (These videos do no next gen games full justice, let alone this one. Beautiful highlight piece if you have a high-end panel.) The story is unique, weird & interesting. The game play is not the highlight, the eyecandy & sound are. Well worth a playthrough just for the experience alone if not the easy gamerscore."
The Artful Escape,It was great to play.
The Artful Escape,"Rhyming tonic with pentatonic was... bold
especially when it doesn't make sense in context"

The Artful Escape,Be excellent to eachother!
The Artful Escape,"As a gamer and guitar player, this is awesome. It is another Annapurna gem."
The Artful Escape,does IGN ever give anything a 9? it always seems like they loved the game alot and really had nothing bad to say about IT but then bam its 8
The Artful Escape,"This game is simply stunning, beautiful and one hell of a wonderful experience"
The Artful Escape,"The words ""80's style mall"" made me feel like an old old man."
The Artful Escape,Great game
The Artful Escape,Game is soooo beautiful
The Artful Escape,Я просто охуел от неё.
The Artful Escape,This game is a mind melting experience. Come in for the visuals and never leave…
The Artful Escape,Well done to the clever wordplay of the reviewer on this one 👏🏻👏🏻
The Artful Escape,Looks intriguing
The Artful Escape,Dont play this when u get high ;)
The Artful Escape,"Can’t help but feel that Microsoft genuinely cared about Psychonauts 2 (obviously they didn’t but the fact they bought double fine and have faith in them to release a console to game is great).

My GOTY!"
The Artful Escape,@5:15 he missed an achievement.  Instead of sliding down jump on the  jelly and press y to get more air so that you can land on that archway.
The Artful Escape,"My galactic name is ""Wild Stallion!"""

The Artful Escape,Just got to the Stargordon. This game is amazing!!! Playing on Series X with Gamepass..
The Artful Escape,"Nice references from This is Spinal Tap, and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"
The Artful Escape,This review is super well written. Well done.
The Artful Escape,Just go pop some Pink Floyd on with a visualizer. Same level of interactivity
The Artful Escape,Looks super boring
The Artful Escape,"So just another Anappurna banger. They just don't miss, do they?"
The Artful Escape,The reviewer had fun writing this one
The Artful Escape,Shrooms and acid stocks are going to go way up!
The Artful Escape,"Let me guess, an 8."
The Artful Escape,Well guess I’m turning game pass back on

The Artful Escape,"Wow, the artstyle is amazing!"
The Artful Escape,An artful escape indeed
The Artful Escape,one of the most spoilery reviews in the history of spoilery reviews :P
The Artful Escape,Is the main character voiced by Dante Basco?  The dude sounds an awful lot like Dante Basco
The Artful Escape,"CAN""T WAIT TO PLAY THIS... I've been waiting for years."
The Artful Escape,Gamepass woot
The Artful Escape,"Definitely going to play this, it looks absolutely beautiful. Thanks Game Pass 😉"
The Artful Escape,8/10
The Artful Escape,Someone give this dude a coffee or something. Is he even awake or alive?
The Artful Escape,FIR
The Artful Escape,This game is AMAZING!
The Artful Escape,10/10
The Artful Escape,This game needs to be played by everyone
The Artful Escape,"The review unfortunately doesn't focus on the most important aspect of any game: the gameplay, or should I say, the lack thereof. It's not really a game like most games. There are no enemies in the side-scrolling environments, there are no real skills needed, it's just running or walking through (beautiful) environments, ocassionally pressing buttons to select dialogue choices or 'wail' your guitar. Only the Simon Says-bosses are somewhat of a mini-game, but it's very basic and far too easy and forgiving. For a game about creating your own stage persona and finding your musical style, there is surprisingly little depth or freedom in the gameplay. Even rhythm doesn't come into play during the minigames!
This is more an audiovisual experience with some interactivity than a platform game. Because the art style is amazing, the lack of actual gameplay seems like a wasted opportunity."
The Artful Escape,"Your guitar playing rarely makes anything more than visual changes to your environment and the playing itself is the same 5 guitar riffs on loop throughout the game regardless of context. The other forms of guitar gameplay are the Simon Says boss fights, where the boss plays a sequence of notes and you play them back until you finish the section, and the free form sections, where you can play whatever notes you want (or none at all) until the section ends. Aside from the Simon Says boss fights, the game requires very little from you aside from moving to the destination at the opposite end of your area. This game, despite it's charming writing, made me feel nothing at all. I'm dead inside."
The Artful Escape,"I played this for €1 for gamepass and it was amazing! That's some polygon-esque gaming from the video tho for the platforming, you don't jump and hit square for the big amped up power jumps? It was like watching someone play rocket league but not using boost"
The Artful Escape,xbox gamepass with yet another
The Artful Escape,very addictive game i love it
The Artful Escape,"You did it was short, but not how short? 4 hours? 6 hours? 2 hours?"
The Artful Escape,The game is amazing one of the best of the year truly top tier gaming although I haven't seen much since the 2017 reveal so I thought the game was still an LSD fueled platformer but I'm not complaining with how this is handled.
The Artful Escape,If I wasn't still randomly drug tested at my job I would love to be high playing this
The Artful Escape,"This review would have been better with you going LOOK AT DIS SHIT, OOOH LISTEN TO DIS SHEET! AHHWW YAH.

  I think everyone just gives everything a high rating so that when they actually find a good game they have to come up with some creative way to let you know this one REALLY is."
The Artful Escape,Interesting atmosphere
The Artful Escape,I like this I'm downloading it right now 😌 the beauty of game pass. A Xbox exclusive in game pass and its good too. So game pass is not getting low budget cannon fodder games 🤔 love the service. I'm even going to front.
The Artful Escape,This would be AMAZING in VR!
The Artful Escape,"Gaming Bolt might be the best, most underrated gaming channel on YouTube when  compared to other popular outlets. Great review."
The Artful Escape,Looks like going to heaven
The Artful Escape,"mxjhc
vur.fyi"
The Artful Escape,Nice review!
The Artful Escape,"""To just how incredibly well the settings that said characters inhabit are"" Say whaaaat? English please! Seriously the writing... it just never gets worse than GB. Why does no one who works for this channel recognize how sh!t the writing is in these reviews. Like over and over again, it's consistently crap."
The Artful Escape,8/10.
Gris,"Pausing video right away, gotta go in blind"
Gris,Gris is boring and trays to hard
Gris,shallow? really? .-.
Gris,"LOL this review, avg american that can’t understand anything that is not from the US 😂😂😂😂"
Gris,"Accurate analysis,, thanks,"
Gris,"""it's not Celeste - 6.5""

what a shitshow."
Gris,Relaxing Game
Gris,"Respectable parts of the review:
If you think its repetitive.
It would be cool to replay chapters with new abilities.
Those are opinions, and perfectly respectable.

Bad parts:
You talk about the story for 2 seconds then move on; Gris is focused on the story why did you not focus on it.
Comparing it to Celeste, those games are radically different on all levels, Celeste primarily a game, with a story, Gris primarily a story plus gameplay.
You say simplicity is fine when done elegantly but you don't say what that means or give an example.
Complaining about replay ability, it's fine if a game is one and done, they don't need to be designed to be raplayable."
Gris,"It's pronounced ""grees"" with the tongue near your lips. Like pig in swedish"
Gris,"This game was so amazing, what the hell are you on about."
Gris,"Q: Are video games Art?
A: 

(also, Journey)"
Gris,Just finished this game. This review doesn't make sense. 6.5? W.t.f.
Gris,Gris is so relaxing game..
Gris,What absolute moron wrote this review lol.
Gris,For me it at least an 8/10
Gris,"""Gris"" if French for ""gray"" and it's pronounced ""gri"". Just sounds silly when you pronounce it ""griss""."
Gris,2:19 mf didn't get this puzzle.
Gris,I'm loving the comments. I'm somewhere in the middle of the game and I'm in love with it. Omg the inability to appreciate a piece of art that some people have.
Gris,"This is an insane game!!! in both design, arts and music"
Gris,"Another braindead review from IGN, what a surprise"
Gris,unsubscribing
Gris,can't even pronounce the name properly
Gris,He can't even pronounce the game correctly...
Gris,"Maybe commenter should focus on Fast and Furious -style action games. Which probably are even more linear. Maybe reviewer should make up his mind if game is linear, or if he keeps getting lost."
Gris,6.5 wtf
Gris,Added to the list of worst ign reviews…
Gris,this review is like listening to a great hiphop album and complaining about the lack of face-melting guitar solos
Gris,2/10 award bait
Gris,"Just finished it.
This game is worth buying."
Gris,The sheer incompetence of IGN is maddening
Gris,How can you even compare this game with Celest LOL
Gris,IGN is just embracing the meme at this point.
Gris,You should Go watch gameXplain’s review if you wish for it to be accurate. He sets his points out clearly and appreciates the game for what it is while giving fair critiques (that being 1).
Gris,Walking simulator
Gris,Why are video game companies trying to make us all cry nowadays?!?
Gris,Gris' level design is magnificent in a way where it expertly guides you to where you need to go without being to overt. How do you get lost in a game like this?
Gris,Fak u Ign
Gris,he sounds like skill up lol
Gris,comparing gris to celeste is like comparing yandere simulator to hitman or persona
Gris,"Gris is a French word for grey. It's pronounced Gree, not Griss."
Gris,I just finished this game and it's certainly not a 6.5. I'll give it a 9 just on the basis of its visuals and music
Gris,"IGN is one of those companies that if it were to go under, I would celebrate."
Gris,This is a masterpiece
Gris,"I almost never agree with IGN's reviews, but this one was ok. IGN points out several legitimate weaknesses. Mechanics are extremely simple for 90% of the game. Foreground and background are inconsistent which make it irritating. Game is quite short and personally I finished it in less than 3 hours. Most of the music is very pleasant but the ability to grow the plants annoyed me and I tried to minimize trying to use it because it disrupts the pleasant background music. The ""story"" is purely poetic which can be very powerful or completely nonsensical depending on how the player interprets it. As an experience, it was decent and I would personally give it a little bit higher score than IGN. It deserves a 7/10 almost purely because of the art and music. If it had average art and music, this game would be subpar and would be a 4/10 because of the glaring weaknesses it has as a video game."
Gris,"Don't waste your time here, just check out the steam user reviews."
Gris,If this is confusing I don't know what planet you are on. If you want confusing try a couple of riddles in Luigi's Mansion (which is also an excellent game).
Gris,This game is definitely a 9/10. It is a masterpiece of storytelling and gameplay is amazing. I put it in the same category as Alto and Ori and Limbo and...
Gris,Damn this review is such a joke
Gris,"Usually, I agree with IGN, but here, the review is utter nonsense! 10 from me!"
Gris,dang ratio af hahaha
Gris,What a big failure this review. It's a beautiful story about the lost and the acceptance.
Gris,Ain't no Mario kart
Gris,"Maybe i'm wrong but i presume the journalist of this review would vote for ""man getting hit by football"" in the Springfield Film Festival instead of Barney's shortfilm:)"
Gris,"Just played this game and beat it for the first time. This is one of the most disrespectful scores IGN has ever given a game. Pathetic. GRIS is, and I rarely use this word, flawless. I can't think of one complaint I have with it. Its staggering how great it is."
Gris,“Griss”. Hahaha
Gris,"""Visual Masterpiece."" 6.5/10"
Gris,Pick up that ball please. You dropped it. Hard.
Gris,Guy sounds like an off brand skill up
Gris,"6.5? There’s no way that’s objective. Objectively you could argue this game is an 8/10. Personally, I’d give it a 10/10. But 6.5? That’s absurd."
Gris,"6.5? lolk
It's a clear, lean, nice game that doesn't overstay its welcome and is a perfect fit for someone newer to gaming or with a more casual skill level."
Gris,Child of Light 10/10
Gris,10/10. Change my mind
Gris,Okay???? OKAY???
Gris,"At 2:19 the whole ""you can't tell whether it's foreground or background"" is the entire damn puzzle- the key is to use the building above, which tells you where the walls aren't present"
Gris,Fall Guys
Gris,"I just finished the game. It left me crying with a warm feeling inside my heart. 

Don't trust this review guys. Down vote and move on"
Gris,"Ign is just a disrespectful gamer to write game review based on their own theory to view a game.
Just stay in a way to rate by the 'playing' experience but they don't realize some of the game a not created just for play. Those game are an arts, a story, a feeling and experience. The way to rate a game from this IGN is narrow."
Gris,"I don't think this guy should have reviewed this game first off. Second, he contradicts himself in getting lost then complaining its too linear. Who is his editor and supervisor?? Whoever they are needs to be fired from this post and mounted somewhere else. And the reviewer is terrible at this. Please do us a favor and pick a different job."
Gris,"I think the foreground and background problem was intentional,so we can try things,and get successful at one of them"
Gris,"Gris on Steam : 10/10 based on over 26k reviews. 
IGN : It's okay... 6.5. 

I don't think you understood the purpose of this game IGN.."
Gris,"When there is red, anger holds us dead,
When there is green, beauty's to be seen,
When there is blue, transparent tears will ensue,
When hope flowers from a mother's kiss, she will find herself, Gris."
Gris,"If you don't already think IGN is a joke, this one seals the deal"
Gris,"So my opinion, very very disappointing, it seemed like it tried so hard to make some sort of point but constantly trips over itself, gets incredibly confused and just as you think it’s going to improve, the next section is worse than the last. This game on the other hand is a completely stunning masterclass on how sometimes less is more with the perfect paring of a beautiful soundtrack to guide you through an incredible story and an emotional journey. Please support the incredible studios that put games like this out and not IGN who are completely out of touch with this industry that we love."
Gris,"Completely agree with the review. This game is bland as hell. 

It looks quite nice (although not all that imo) but the experience of playing it is dull, dull, dull. The music is forgettable too. Doesn’t deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Journey."
Gris,Isn't the name of the protagonist Gris?
Gris,Meanwhile TLOU2 gets a 10/10.
Gris,Shitty review -_-
Gris,I'm sorry are you comparing this game with celeste? I've played celeste and never played gris but can see it is very different.
Gris,Not ign completely missing the point and being bad at games yet again 🤭 too linear but also got lost 6.5/10.
Gris,"Visual 10, Sound and Music 9, Story 7-8, gameplay was okay... about 6... ==> (10+9+8+6)/4= 8.25..."
Gris,"""Freelance Video Producer"" says it all..."
Gris,"REVIEW NOT AGREE WITH ME AND EVERYONE ELSE, REVIEWER BAD"
Gris,"""IGN is nitpicking and biased"""
Gris,“There’s no pokemon capture mechanic”
Gris,"""kept getting lost."" When I played this, I didn't mind getting lost because there was always something to be found."
Gris,The most beautiful game I have ever played.
Gris,6.5 ??? Are you kidding me ?
Gris,“Open to interpretation” is what you say when you don’t know how to understand symbolism
Gris,"I love you man, but you're just wrong"
Gris,"U guys are morons, THIS game is a MASTERPIECE"
Gris,The number of dislikes tho
Gris,"Gris is not for entertaining young kids. It's a artistic masterpiece built to echo with things deep inside your heart. The reviewer will understand it, someday."
Gris,I feel like it would have been more fair to compare it to journey than celeste. Celeste is in a very different genre.
Gris,"This is a fair review, but I feel that you don't get the appeal of the game if you're discussing the complexity of the puzzles and comparing it to Celeste. I think more along the lines of a game such as Journey when I think of this game. To be frank, however, this review likely voices the opinion of most gamers so it's spot on to the consensus. If you're a douchey videogame hipster like me though, you'll view this game more along the lines of an 8.5 or a 9."
Gris,Ooops came to IGN expecting a geniune review...
Gris,"I agree with your review by a BIT. However, most of your criticism shows us that you've completely missed the point of the game. While I agree that the background is confusing, to the game's defence, that is also part of the whole symbolism and story. the parts of the Chapters that would block your return to the earlier parts would be technical limitations. this is a $17 indie game after all, not a $300 casino. And also for me, the game is actually more replayable than most AAA games that are just straight up lazy and greedy."
Gris,"you're literally cancelled, bye"
Gris,"warning: this rewiev is a freakshow, dont take it serious."
Gris,Shame IGN
Gris,"The second you compared it to celeste you lost me... completely different games and completely different focuses... also ""to linear"" but you ""kept getting lost""? Okay"
Gris,"Thanks for watching. If you enjoyed the video, be sure to hit the like and subscribe buttons, and if you REALLY liked the video, consider supporting me on Patreon. You get a fancy script every time I do one of my big 'The Review' reviews: https://www.patreon.com/skillupyt"
Gris,"This ain’t just a game, this is ART!"
Gris,Just bought this on a sale
Gris,Just saw the trailer for Neva and really liked it. I was interested whether this developer made anything else and holy shit am I going to play the fuck out of this game. I hope it makes me cry.
Gris,What song is in your outro?
Gris,"this game has made me cry more than once, 11/10 would cry again"
Gris,My wife and I recently had a death in the family… This game was our solace in a storm of the unknown. It truly is a beautiful masterpiece. One that I will always be grateful for.
Gris,"omg your sound mix is awful, music is three times louder than your voice x.x"
Gris,Just play and finish this game not 100% though. The visual just pin me to the chair for hrs and hrs. Love it!!
Gris,I just finished this game last night. Im so glad I went in blind cause I did not expect the emotional hit.
Gris,Just jumped back into this with the ps5 upgrade. Everything the added with the dualsense are really cool
Gris,"Bedause yt knows everything I do, this video was recommended to me 3 years after it was made, but only a couple of weeks after I completed this game. Funny enough, I played Journey *after* Gris and immediately drew parallels. Gris really is a lovely playing experience, and I’m glad SU mentioned how the levels and puzzles guide you. It’s such a joy to feel like you’re in capable hands and can…well, trust a game you’re playing. Not trust that you’ll succeed at all of it, but trust that what’s happening is intentional and is going somewhere, rather than just eating your time, showing off, or worst of all, being buggy and full of dead ends. Highly recommend for a relaxing, wind down experience."
Gris,"yeah, its amazing....and I had no intent on playing this game but G2A bundled it with the game I bought(it made my game cheaper with the bundle) and I was like...I will check it out.  and oh boy i play it more than the game I originally bought with it.  LOL"
Gris,I can't believe I held off playing this masterpiece for almost 4 GODDAM years. Oh my God this game is gorgeous and beautiful and amazing omg what are you doing not having played this? It's usually 5 bucks on the switch and less than 10 bucks on the playstation.
Gris,"I cried watching this review. Can't wait to play Gris. Beautiful game and one of the best content creators out there.
Mad respect to you Skill Up. Please, never change."
Gris,"I played this game while being abroad with Friends.
We went to some art show and this game was playable there on a massive screen.
Everyone was absolutely enamoured with the game. 
Bought it immediately after"
Gris,Just got through this game on my Steam Deck playing outside. Wow!
Gris,"$20  in 2018 and now 2022 sony sells it for $23, SONY STOP MILKING EVERYONE 😡🤬"
Gris,Was recommended this game by a friend after a dear family member passed away and we could not hold a funeral for. They're still in my heart and I keep in touch and just... what a game.
Gris,"Beautiful.
Just ordered the collector's edition for the Switch, with artwork and soundtrack, for my daughter. She will love it. 
I am a sucker for artful games like this (and Journey, etc...), so I am supporting the developer!"
Gris,Reading through the comments it seems like I'm not the only one coming back here to praise this masterpiece of a game! What an amazing experience - it's not often that a game evokes a sense of wonder that brings a smile to my face and has me saying 'Oh wow!' out loud almost every time you walk into a new area or do a new puzzle. Thanks for the recommendation Ralph!
Gris,"games that rely on graphics have next to no replay value, besides their inherent grind, which is why they make a new sports and CoD game every year."
Gris,I just finished this game....and I am sobbing.
Gris,This game was so beautiful that it made a grown ass man tear up. There is nothing quite like it.
Gris,"Completely agree. I picked this one up a couple months ago, watching the trailer was enough... then I read some reviews that decried it based off of being just beautiful art with barely any gameplay... even so I was convinced the art alone was worth it, and once I actually played the game.... my goodness, what a delightful surprise - the puzzles are intelligent and subtle, and the different mechanics you get to work with in and around them top the game off with a most sensible idea of progression.
_Sensible_ is maybe the best word I have for this game - the story, the art, and the perfect balance between an experience both challenging and casual. (I'm dreaming about what a sequel for this game would be like...)"
Gris,"I just finished GRIS, had to come by and rave about how beautiful the game is. T_______________T"
Gris,"I remember watching this reviews and thinking I'll likely play this sooner or later, it took me 3 years to get to it and a binge playthrough during the holiday season but the beauty of games like Gris is they never age due to the visual style and simple yet flawless mechanics."
Gris,finished this yesterday. thx skill up =)
Gris,"thank you, someone who understands how beautiful and amazing this game is

Edit: the name means grey in french, and is pronounced without the s"
Gris,One of the best game i've ever played art style is just perfect
Gris,GODDAMN this music tho. So good.
Gris,3 Years later I must say that the best moment of this game was connection with that tiny cube-head guy. Brilliant. 10/10.
Gris,Just finished playing this. It is absolutely stunning.
Gris,Just bought it on sale for $7 really excited
Gris,Looks so stunning!!!
Gris,"Your video really does the game justice of how beautiful and meaningful Gris is, awesome job. Thank you."
Gris,"Currently 4 minutes into this review. Since starting the video I've bought the game, started installing it, and I'm closing the video now to avoid spoilers."
Gris,Would love to see some AAA studio make worlds like this.
Gris,I bought this game on the strength of this review and also the graphical style intruiged me. I finally got round to playing and finishing it today and i agree with pretty much everything you said about it. Remarkable experience. Beautiful beautiful game. Thank you.
Gris,"I originally went into this game blind, I came out crying and with a new favorite game"
Gris,"Hey here I am comment on a video that's almost 3 years old, about a thing nobody cares about, but here I go anyway. You mentioned the journey doesn't leverage its existence as a game to heighten the experience, yet the single most innovative thing about journey is the relationships you form with random players through gameplay anyway. I'm a big fan of the channel and I love this game thank you."
Gris,This game seems to be strangely unavailable though the PS Store at the moment?
Gris,"Oh my God 2d character sliding down with a 8 frame animation? Holy shit so beautiful. 

What the fuck did i just watch?"
Gris,Grissssss
Gris,Thank U skillup for making me play this game
Gris,When games like this are given low scores but last of us p2 is a masterpiece 10/10 according to ign lol
Gris,is there any sort of combat in the game at all?
Gris,IGN take notes and stop half-assing your reviews
Gris,"I didn't skip maybe I should have. Three and a bit hours I don't care if I come away from the game a new person but just over three hours are you joking? Can you compare this to metal gear 2 an eighty hour game? Visage recently blew me away I'm at about forty hours, I've been gaming thirty years im bored of shooting games but if it isn't at least 15 to 20 hours I leave well alone. I admire your passion and the designer's for doing something different. But three hours?"
Gris,This game is indescribably beautiful. One of my most memorable gaming experiences. I wish more people will give it a go.  Definitely play on a nice big screen and good sound system for the intended effects.
Gris,Journey is shit
Gris,Just rewatched your engaged/engaging Gris review. Too bad one can't give a second Like.
Gris,This game always help me every time I get anxiety attack
Gris,Frick man. You sold me on this game in 1 minute and 26 seconds. Goddamnit
Gris,You got a sub ✅
Gris,"GRIS is a story of a loss and of learning how to move on. The colors and design of its 5 levels perfectly match the 5 stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. The artist is a genius to be able to pull this off. One of the best indie games of the year for me."
Gris,Just got it! It’s amazing
Gris,"I absolutely love this game. The colors, the animation, the emotions, everything is just so beautifull. In my opinion, this game is best played on the switch or pc. It just feels like you're actually playing a drawing on the switch. Tbf i only played it on undocked mode so maybe that's the reason but it just looked so nice on the undocked switch compared to the others imo."
Gris,"I have not played this, but it looks amazing."
Gris,"Thank you for such a fantastic, well written review. I absolutely loved this game.  ""Please support this developer and buy this game"". Agree 100%"
Gris,that games reminds me of moving castle art style
Gris,Sold me @ 3:20
Gris,"Every person i know who played this game(myself included) broke down into tears or had to wipe a few away, becouse damn, this game is incredible, i've never seen a game that can convey emotion without words as good as this game.
And its music will leave u spellbound.(or make u cry again)"
Gris,"I have heard nothing but hype about this game and keep thinking ""Should I buy it? All the media is raving about it""
And then I look into it.... and have flashbacks to Journey / Abzu. I fucking hated those games.

Visually they looked stunning, music-wise they were great, sounds design wise... meh... didn''t really get it.
But the actual game I played, infuriatingly designed.  Constantly thinking ""Oh I'm curious about this"" then exploring it to find nothing at all. Just a movie where you need to do the exact right thing to see what they want you to, but offering absolutely nothing if you do the wrong thing, and offering very little guidance (or when being guided, making the game very boring). I enjoy linear games, but they need to be designed to pace me and deliver engagement.

And the counter for Gris is oh well it IS being more of a game, look you platform. But every shot I see if just the exact same jump (distance and platform-size wise) with the occasional glide. The exact bare minimum for platforming (plus a glide).

I can't shake the fact that games media creators aren't really big on... playing video games. Like, they're burned out and just want to review a movie once in a while. Because there are some weird consensuses among media outlets about which games are good.  Last of Us Part 2 for example. 
I just can't take chances on these kinds of games anymore, too many indies in the past have burned me for it. And I specifically buy mostly indie games, I've just learned to avoid ""arthouse"" indies where the review Pro bulletpoint is ""artstyle"". 
After all those burns, I really need someone to convince me to play a game instead of just recommending it to me. And all Gris has gotten from people is ""Oh fuck its so beautiful, ya gotta play it"". Maybe I'd like a Gris artbook? But I don't see how the act of playing the videogame would do anything but hamper my enjoyment of the art."
Gris,I need to play this game 🔥🔥🔥💯.
Gris,"I started this game, got to the color green, then decided that I will save  the rest of this wonderful experience for my birthday or maybe Xmas *later edit* couldnt resist, it was so chill and enjoyable and beautiful to finish"
Gris,"I would argue that Journey is using interactivity sparingly to create emotion. It doesn't want to give you challenge, it wants to give you a sense of mystery, of wonder, of dread, it wants you to internalise what you see and do in the game and create your own understanding and interpretation. Too much challenge would ruin this. That's one of the reason I see a disconnect between the wonderfull world design of Destiny 2, and the gameplay, the grinding, loot hunting, endless waves of enemies.... Destiny 2 is at best the sum of its parts. They don't gel together to create better whole. Over gamifying what you want to be an emotional experience will inevitably end up ruining it."
Gris,"This video is now on my list of best video reviews ever. Along with Colin Moriarty's Amalur review, Ryan Clements' Journey review and Erik Brudvig's Mass Effect 2 review."
Gris,I'm so glad you made this video. IGNs review was a damn sacrilege.
Gris,Is there a r6 camo for ela related to this or is it a coincidence
Gris,"This is one of my absolute favorite games of all time. The entire experience resonated so much with me, and I can't thank Nomada Studio and Berlinist enough for the work they did to convey so much through graphics and sound. This game isn't a work of art because it's beautiful to listen to or to look at, it's art because it's has something to say beneath all that beauty. But it is also just so GD beautiful."
Gris,AAA studios learn and observe.
Gris,Journey was a great experience but I can't help but roll my eyes every time I hear someone proclaim that it's the best or one of the best experiences they've ever had with a video game. Especially a reviewer; someone who plays a *lot* of video games.
Gris,This review let me to playing the game and now I can't recommend it enough.
Gris,Game is best played on LSD
Gris,This or outer wilds!
Gris,"i saw this in passing and yes, from first look, i know this is going to be powerful"
Gris,Screw the Eel so hard to get the trophy!!! But the game is a piece of art and with the soundtracks is a masterpiece
Gris,It's one of the best games I ever played!
Gris,"Several games have made me cry before, but this one hit me in that special cry-place. It was some real shit.
Like he said, it's beautiful, fun to play, amazing to listen to. But it also really punches you in the feels a lot if you've lost anything or anyone in a big way."
Gris,"play this while youre high, youll cry"
Gris,Beautiful game and wonderful review. If you didn't support this title I would no longer have need to be subbed to this channel. Well done.
Gris,Did you ever play the Unfinished Swan? its giving me those vibes
Gris,"This game reminds me of Child of Light, the most beautiful game I ever played"
Gris,"This ain't gaming. No I don t play crap with loot boxes and shit, I play games like doom, Hollow Knight, resident evil remake, JRPGS, this...this is nothing"
Gris,A fucking piece of art that you control. I'm speechless.
Gris,"Right now I'm so excited waiting for Gris to download in our PS4, it is a gift for my son. Good news for everyone is that until next couple weeks the price is at 60% discount. Please ""don't skip this""."
Gris,"I love how so much of this review is just ""here's the game. Do you see how amazing it is?""

FUCKING PLAY THIS GAME!"
Gris,The pitter patter of the character's feet is pure asmr.
Gris,"Hmmm... Hungry Hungry Hippos, the original QTE."
Gris,finish this game yesterday. it's so astonishing
Gris,"I got this game based on this review, and it had some really awesome moments, was absolutely gorgeous, but it kind of miffed the landing for me. It was too vague and esoteric to actually have any lasting impact with me. It was a bunch of cool designs and beautiful art and interesting ideas that didn't really add up to much. It ultimately reminded me of journey, except Journey did it first and journey did it better."
Gris,"Skill Up, just subscribed. Amazing review, made me escape the clutches of IGN Reviews and trust my gut instinct that this will be an amazing experience to play. Going to buy this one, Jotun and Sundered. <3"
Gris,"This game is therapeutic, a calming experience, a moment to breathe and think, I don't think I understood all it's meaning, but still got me in tears at the end."
Gris,What's the song at the beginning of the video
Gris,Did IGN play the same game?
Gris,I just played this and holy shit. Amazing.
Gris,IGN may just be jealous or angry cause devolver digital didn't give them game for free or payed them for review. Just kidding.
Gris,"I don't need IGN's reference to measure rate if a games good or bad, this game was simply astonishing for me 👍🏼"
Gris,@1:18 which game is this?? Anybody?
Lisa: The Painful,This video looks completely different once you finish the lisa series
Lisa: The Painful,omg definitive edition i can't wait !
Lisa: The Painful,LISAAA

Lisa: The Painful,"I dont even wanna know what was the 1st thing happen in his life.
(yes... It's probably meeting dunky..)"
Lisa: The Painful,6 years later and I still come back to this video at least once a year
Lisa: The Painful,I want to play this again but not sure if I can handle having my life ruined a 2nd time.
Lisa: The Painful,4:49 DICK STUCK IN A RHINO'S ASS
Lisa: The Painful,should have called it TOMAR
Lisa: The Painful,"5:16 Not to be one of those people, but Pizza Tower sounds?"
Lisa: The Painful,this is the best game ever
Lisa: The Painful,"This game made me sob on numerous occasions. And not for the reasons you might think after watching this video. Give it a play, I dare ya."
Lisa: The Painful,I like how there's only one major spoiler in this video
Lisa: The Painful,"Hey Dunk my man can you please do a video on The©Deed franchise available on STEAM, including The Deed, The Deed: Dynasty, and of course can't forget about The Deed II.  Love Ya!~"
Lisa: The Painful,-2 damage craked me up
Lisa: The Painful,dunkey the best and most loyal Dingalinger ever
Lisa: The Painful,10M views bro how tf is this game unpopular??? its absolutely the best game ever
Lisa: The Painful,6:03
Lisa: The Painful,6:12
Lisa: The Painful,This game REALLY makes you feel like you’re playing LISA
Lisa: The Painful,how does this have 10 million views
Lisa: The Painful,When you win because you are more high on drugs (wait did Katana ZERO take inspiration from Lisa?): *insert giga chad*
Lisa: The Painful,Real
Lisa: The Painful,2:05 well yeah I mean the bad guy of the game IS on screen at that moment so
Lisa: The Painful,"I have to say, after such an unpredictable year, dunkey really got me with his game of the year pick. I wonder what game will win next year"
Lisa: The Painful,The bucket scene made me laugh so damn hard I had to stop playing to compose myself. I could not breathe 😂
Lisa: The Painful,Bought this game after this video thinking it would be the same silly game in these clips…they were not lying about that life ruining experience
Lisa: The Painful,MY MAN TERRY HINTZ
Lisa: The Painful,"Look. I’m new to this guy. I’ve binged this channel. This is a top 10, maybe top 5 dunkey right here. Idk. Maybe it was his little brother or he had a blind fold on wgaf"
Lisa: The Painful,"Here at 10,438,779 views. (before that too... maybe)"
Lisa: The Painful,This game was made for dunkey alone
Lisa: The Painful,"OK, I can't say anything about La Mulana here."
Lisa: The Painful,I've only discovered this game recently and I already love it.
Lisa: The Painful,5:11 🤣🤣🤣🤣😂 I never laughed so hard in my life!
Lisa: The Painful,who would make this?
Lisa: The Painful,"I almost got mad at the No Man’s Sky garbage but, then I realized this was uploaded 5 years ago. Fair enough 👍"
Lisa: The Painful,"Nice game, but it's not nice towards the player."
Lisa: The Painful,I do not remember dunkey talking about horse erections so much coming back to this
Lisa: The Painful,"undertale soy cringe BAD for -1 y o kids bcause its WHOLESOME and KIND and POPULAR!!! and lisa SIGMA ALPHA GIGACHAD MATURE bcause ITS NOT FOR EVERYONE AND THERES RAPE AND DRUGS AND VERY MUCH DEATH AND CHILD ABUSE HECK YESSSSS!!!! and it it came B4 UNDERTAEL!!!!







For real people, what's wrong with some of you? I played both games and I enjoyed them equally (though I like the Lisa battle system more than UT's. Always been a large fan of classic RPGs). Being cocky about LISA's matureness and brutality doesn't make you look much better than the cringe part of Undertale fandom that includes Sans fangirls etc. By trying to prove Lisa isn't Undertale you're only cementing its role as anti-undertale (as some other guy in the comments said it).

The less edgy part of the community I don't judge. I understand you may enjoy one of the games more than the other one.

The letsplay is fire though. Had a good chuckle or two."
Lisa: The Painful,10 million views. And people STILL haven't played LISA.
Lisa: The Painful,Gotta love that Lisa soundtrack lol
Lisa: The Painful,So yea I might have accidental force Nintendo work on Switch 2 opps
Lisa: The Painful,10 Million views and yet nobody has played this masterpiece of a game…
Lisa: The Painful,"Very well written, but I’m one of those neanderthals who couldn’t get through the backtracking and combat system"
Lisa: The Painful,"I've just finished this game, all I'm gonna say is that dunkey was right about the ""turn back"" part when it cuts to the ending."
Lisa: The Painful,The i have no mouth and i must scream of rpg
Lisa: The Painful,Terry is actually a very good support
Lisa: The Painful,"This game is genuinely one of the best, yet most absolutely fucking soul crushing and horrendous, games that I've ever played.

11/10 do recommend to anyone that doesn't think they'll ""kick the bucket"" before playing all the way through"
Lisa: The Painful,"L - Let

I - In

S - Some

A - Ashes"
Lisa: The Painful,No Mans Sky is on garbage island. 6:24
Lisa: The Painful,No man's sky XD
Lisa: The Painful,Look at my horse. My horse is amazing
Lisa: The Painful,"If I could go back in time once, I'd stop myself from playing this"
Lisa: The Painful,"That scene where dunkey goes into that ""abandoned"" store reminds me of fallout new vegas on your way out of primm going next to that gas station and going in to explore and you load into a group full of people just looking at you. First time I was there I used all my supplies saving primm. I think I had one melee weapon and got smacked"
Lisa: The Painful,"6:25 that can't be real xDDDD
No mans sky on the garbage island"
Lisa: The Painful,"I think Black Thought also sampled Delin's grunt on the track ""Strangers"" from his latest album ""Cheat Codes""

2. New jokes to tell"
Lisa: The Painful,"Aye young nigga, you feeling nostalgic and sad. This is indeed the place for that. Don’t play it."
Lisa: The Painful,"even if you had gotten the water bucket first, why would the main character still be like ""yeah, ill toss this bucket of water on these kids"""
Lisa: The Painful,For the love of god does anyone know how to map a ps4 controller for this game??  I don’t understand
Lisa: The Painful,"I felt the ""what a thrill"" coming and I'm so glad ya hit it twice"
Lisa: The Painful,"*You're tearing me apart, Lisa!*"
Lisa: The Painful,Dunkey's laugh is so contagious
Lisa: The Painful,Fun game
Lisa: The Painful,"2:45

The wizard store is a very underrated scene from dunky tbh😂"
Lisa: The Painful,i love this game and video so much
Lisa: The Painful,"BUMP bc this is one of the greatest dunky video ev... WAIT WHOS THAT? JERRY NO! DONT SEND IN GEX ... WAIT WHA? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO 

""This was more dramatic that weekend I stayed at Ray Liotta's beach house."" RIP"
Lisa: The Painful,why is this subtitled in 18 freakin languages?

Lisa: The Painful,What is the music @2:54 ???
Lisa: The Painful,6:25 faust in lisa
Lisa: The Painful,0:19
Lisa: The Painful,This is a certified Dunk classic.

Lisa: The Painful,Of the kids burning was his second most tragic thing ever what’s the first
Lisa: The Painful,"""I think it's over"" *walks away*

Lisa: The Painful,Oh my God i laughed so hard i'm in tears
Lisa: The Painful,"Ah, my introduction to videogamedunkey. He's still got it baby!"
Lisa: The Painful,Terry is a dig beal
Lisa: The Painful,"If you're are reading this, you now are legally required to purchases Lisa: The painful"
Lisa: The Painful,Lol
Lisa: The Painful,i come back and rewtach this video every so often
Lisa: The Painful,"And yes, this game actually is that ridiculous. (Also pretty sad, savage and tragic.) Really have to rewatch that Playthrough Materwelonz did."
Lisa: The Painful,If dunkey made a game:
Lisa: The Painful,10M  lets gooooo!
Lisa: The Painful,"i died at "" what did i do wrong "" guy. guy just want to chill bruh"
Lisa: The Painful,"Donkey you have lozt my rezpect for you, for giving away Terry zo you could keep your ztuff"
Lisa: The Painful,One of the best games of all time.
Lisa: The Painful,ok but when is part 2 of lisa coming out?
Lisa: The Painful,Watched this years before I actually played any of the games.  HOLY SHIT I MISSED OUT!  10/10 is absolutely correct.
Lisa: The Painful,Definitive edition
Lisa: The Painful,"WELP. TIME TO GET READY TO REVIEW THIS AGAIN, NEW EDITION BABEEEEE"
Lisa: The Painful,"Gay , bi and pan men exist:) this reality would not happen"
Lisa: The Painful,"You're tearing me apart, Lisa!"
Lisa: The Painful,Ding a ling as opposed to dong is long.
Lisa: The Painful,My favorite post apocalypse is mario
Lisa: The Painful,"One of my favourite videos in this whole site, period."
Lisa: The Painful,"yeah, can't think of any other way for men to get off in a world with only men...they could only resort to porno....sheesh."
Lisa: The Painful,did you really not keep terry in your party? he’s like the best party member by far (at higher levels (no spoilers tho)) but more importantly he’s the OG… he’s your first friend!!
Lisa: The Painful,My fav postapocaliptic game is fallout new vegas
Lisa: The Painful,"I know this is an old video, but I can't fuck with rpg's like this. I like it when they're like SMT"
Lisa: The Painful,"After trawling a large number of Lisa streams over the years, I've made a key discovery.

No matter how simple and intuitive your tutorials are, people *will not* understand them.  The amount of people I see playing this game (even after reading the tutorial) and NOT using combos throughout the entire playthrough is infuriating.  Not only that, but the bicycle tutorial goes over most people's heads too.  The amount of people I've seen never get on the bike after getting it, immediately dismount and walk back, or get on the bike then jump vertically down from the platform, completely missing the most basic tutorial ever, is astounding.  This is why long, drawn out, forced tutorials have become the norm.  People just cannot comprehend quick ""tip"" style tutorials OR environmental tutorials."
Lisa: The Painful,Marty is one of those characters that I'd pay money to beat up
Lisa: The Painful,"one thing: if the ost was made using FL trial then it would be against FL studios use terms and agreements, it states you must buy a liscense before commercializing any music made, but they can be shared for free, however lisa charges for the soundtrack alone so that might be an issue"
Lisa: The Painful,I feel like Dingaling and Toby Fox are the only ones who knows how to make an RPG games that aren't a waste of time and don't have that boring grinding mechanics.
Lisa: The Painful,My favorite choice in the game is where you let Terry die so you can keep your beef jerky and soda
Lisa: The Painful,Why is Beady everywhere
Lisa: The Painful,Lisa is more like during the apocalypse than post apocalypse.
Lisa: The Painful,"0:08 Double Dragon Advance. Yeah, it takes place in a Mad Max/Fist Of The North Star kind of post-apocalyptic world. I never knew that til way later, but once you know that, you ll recognize the FotNS inspirations. The red car in the garage in the very beginning is the car from the FMV game Road Avenger (it has a few different regional names), which is clearly Mad Max inspired, maybe not full post apocalypse though."
Lisa: The Painful,"you know, after seeing this review ages ago. finally playing the game after so long, i get it now, everything that he said, its strange to think that i played this game that ive been wanting to play for like 5 years ago now. I even looked up some other lisa fangames to play as i assumed  there were more then 2, and there was, i hope you review this sometimes as those 4 videos have always been seen by me as your best videos you've made."
Lisa: The Painful,The strongarm combos remind me of The Legend of Legaia rpgs.
Lisa: The Painful,⚠️ Some Bad Flashing Lights ⚠️
Lisa: The Painful,"""It'll kick in your teeth and piss in your mouth, leaving a taste that's unpleasant, yet strangely addicting.""

Well, this sound like the type of game I should avoid like the fucking plague."
Lisa: The Painful,Very well compiled video. Great work.
Lisa: The Painful,Yes
Lisa: The Painful,A very sad game
Lisa: The Painful,"I watched this video a couple years after it came out, around when I was too young to ask to get this game. I played it for the first time in 2022 thanks to the quality of this video keeping me anxious to play it. Truly an amazing experience, this channel has definitely opened me and many others up to some truly incredible games that we wouldn't have seen otherwise. 
Also glad u like Garth heh,"
Lisa: The Painful,it's the end of 2021 and the text thing did not get fixed
Lisa: The Painful,"Man your videos are so timeless bro
I had this vid playing in the background while I was drawing and then I heard you say “the best game of 2014” I was like wait w h at
the editing and overall video quality has definitely gotten way better but your audio and voiceover and script (is that the right thing? Probably) is just so good istg I would’ve thought you made this vid this year if it wasn’t for you mentioning it’s 2014

but anyways ima listen to some more of your videos till I finish this drawing 
hope you have a good day or night m8"
Lisa: The Painful,"""It'll piss in your mouth leaving a taste that's unpleasant, but strangely addictive""

?????????????????????????"
Lisa: The Painful,This nigga just said veg
Lisa: The Painful,"ooo this EXP systems reminds me of Epic Battle Fantasy 5, i played the whole game without having to farm exp (you can farm exp and you gain good exp but it's not needed.) it was a blast. I really need to play lisa."
Lisa: The Painful,"my favorite party member is bo wyatt,, hes so cute and cool and i like his guitar attacks"
Lisa: The Painful,">Fallout 3
oh man"
Lisa: The Painful,"Gotta imagine how hard it must have been to code in all the systems unique to Lisa...
For those wondering, RPG Maker VX Ace's standard systems function similarly to an old Dragon Quest game. Top down visuals, and when battle hits, the enemy is right in front of you. Now, they obviously kept the second part as is, but the change from the small top-down map to a much larger sidescroller map, and the addition of a combo system... That must have taken a while to code in."
Lisa: The Painful,Nitro Rad review LISA: The Timeless and LISA: The Unbreakable
Lisa: The Painful,"My party i us (that is amazing) is,
Jack - magic guy,
Birdie - drunk guy,
Nerd - you know that son of a bitch. 
Magic guy/Jack does damage to an entire party and does fire damage he and Birdie are by far my favorite. =]"
Lisa: The Painful,best rpg I have ever played
Lisa: The Painful,17:41 w h a t
Lisa: The Painful,white scars best legion
Lisa: The Painful,I actually made a mod for this game. I haven't released it publicly and may need to unearth where I put it but if Nitro would like I could send it to him for private use sometime.
Lisa: The Painful,Choices aren't just superficial if they dont change core mechanics.  *facepalm*
Lisa: The Painful,oh boy that first screen.
Lisa: The Painful,Fallout 4
Lisa: The Painful,very good game. Not what I'd call fun tho. Couldn't beat it because it was so depressing and I have my mental health to think about. But damn its a good game.
Lisa: The Painful,17:40 W h a t ? You like the taste of--- I'm disgusted and disappointed.
Lisa: The Painful,Why do I aways see Buzzo's as the paint underneath?

Lisa: The Painful,does anyone know what the song at 8:04 is it sounds familiar
Lisa: The Painful,Thank you so much for not spoiling the game
Lisa: The Painful,"This deep, dark, depressingly realistic and horrifying game was made by a guy called Dingaling. 
Dingaling. That is bloody hilarious."
Lisa: The Painful,00:12 My fav post apocaliptic game is Shin Megami Tensei 1
Lisa: The Painful,How is it that with Fall Damage in 2-D we got from Bubsy to LISA: The Painful RPG?
Lisa: The Painful,8:35 how do you do that? I wanna play this game with my new pro controller

😉👍"
Lisa: The Painful,"Joy, eh? Kinda like in We Happy Few. But in that game drug make artificual happiness, here it just makes people forget things. Would it make much more sense if drug been calling... Oblivion?"
Lisa: The Painful,"Wow! Looks like Last of Us demake. Man prefer happiness of one child over entire world's fate. But I don't think the only would be enough to recreate human race, so humanity screwed either way. No need to drastic measures."
Lisa: The Painful,"When i ask you what your favorite post apocalyptic game is? Most of you would say fallout 3 withou-

Lisa: The Painful,"12:00 ""there is no grinding in this game""
Me: laughs in silhouettes in caves, snakes in grass, and purple snakes in swamp"
Lisa: The Painful,I feel that first statement is false
Lisa: The Painful,"Me realising the first Buzzo sacrifice is nearby: Alright you guys hang at the bar I'll be going to handle something.

Lisa: The Painful,Hey Rad joy is simular to the drug well joy in we happy few
Lisa: The Painful,"Nitro, have you played Citizens of Earth/Citizens of Space?   Worth a look ,to be sure."
Lisa: The Painful,17:41 wtf
Lisa: The Painful,9:03 You listen here GARTH IS A LITTLE PIECE OF SHIT
Lisa: The Painful,"I love Brad’s design. He looks so tough and aggressive but when he looking down, slouched, or laying down he looks sad and somber, like when he is up and ready to go he wants to show his tough side so he can look intimidating, while when he is alone and or walking around without wanting a fight he shows his true colors, a sad lonely boy that gets picked on and bullied."
Lisa: The Painful,i would say fallout new vegas
Lisa: The Painful,"As I remember Buckets (One of the strongest party members) is adicted to joy. You can piece together why, he is the guy on the rooftop of the Russian Roulete building. Guess he was a conatant winner of it.
He probably numbed his fear of death with Joy"
Lisa: The Painful,"“Kick in your teeth and piss in your mouth”
I dont know but that doesnt sound addicting at all..."
Lisa: The Painful,I started this game with both my arms and a smile on my face. I left with none of these.
Lisa: The Painful,"Did you know that here is a unused class in the game called a ""Somebody""? Looks like LISA was planned to have a good ending but it was scrapped."
Lisa: The Painful,12:52
Lisa: The Painful,Mines shin megami tensei.
Lisa: The Painful,I do wanna say that grinding can defintely be extremely fun especially if the combat is insane
Lisa: The Painful,"0:18
I like you"
Lisa: The Painful,"you know, the Joy thing reminds me a lot of the Abominations from darkest dungeon. They have a move that turns them into a gruesome beast, it has better moves and better damage but using it increases the stress of your allies, I feel like you don't see a lot of risk/reward items/abilities in games that often."
Lisa: The Painful,this game made me actually depressed for like 3 weeks
Lisa: The Painful,my awnser to that question is underrail.
Lisa: The Painful,What is the chronological order of Lisa The?
Lisa: The Painful,"17:40 ""The taste of pizz is unpleasant yet strangely addicting""
*HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?*"
Lisa: The Painful,Teamfortress 2 and csgo are full of achievements so correct me if I'm wrong you play more those or not
Lisa: The Painful,Brad -Armstrong- *Brad armsgone*
Lisa: The Painful,That “trial” of fl studio is actually a version with a hacked key. He had access to the full thing he had to of.
Lisa: The Painful,That was one aspect of Lisa the painful I loved. The joy mechanic. It’s quite realistic to what you’ll be if you’re on anything harder than weed. My guess is joy is opium because it makes you feel nothing. It’s a great feeling but the withdrawals are the most horrible thing to go through.
Lisa: The Painful,"Personally, and I swear to god this is the truth, Destiny 2. I mean, the game does take place in a world ravaged by an incomprehensible darkness. And there are incredibly few safe havens. Those being on earth. And one of those safe havens had previously been decimated by one of the enemy factions. So I'd consider it to be a post apocalyptic game"
Lisa: The Painful,My favorite is the End is Nigh
Lisa: The Painful,Would this game work badly as a animated tv show.
Lisa: The Painful,Nah.  New Vegas is my favorite game in a post apocalyptic world.
Lisa: The Painful,7:18 song please?
Lisa: The Painful,Right off the bat we know that Lisa is dead more likely by suicide. Well it looks to me more like an execution than a suicide or sending the message she was forced to die because of others...
Lisa: The Painful,Olathe has many doors Brad-boy!
Fez,Interesting game
Fez,"""Phil would be proud.""





.....if he saw this.. 

HE'S NOT DEAD!"
Fez,This game inspires monument valley and crossy road
Fez,7.8 Too many blocks
Fez,"Identify my age by sending you a photo of my credit card or my Id?

Are you kidding???"
Fez,Fez is pure art at its finest.
Fez,"Switch version, let's check this one out finally"
Fez,switch version brought me here. it's finally time to give it a shot!
Fez,Here for the switch version!
Fez,Long after the internet warriors and enemy's of the artist moved on the art is still here and still important thanks Phil ✨💫
Fez,But does it Reeeeeaaally makes you feel like spiderman?
Fez,I played this when I was 3 and I cried because I could not do it
Fez,2d monument valley
Fez,Should've got a 10
Fez,who remembers this from their childhood ahhaha
Fez,this game really makes you FEEL like you're phil fish
Fez,why not 10? What takes that .5 away?
Fez,I think this is the first video game I ever played on the Xbox 360.
Fez,How is this 9.5 of there is literally no cons
Fez,phil phish stole this game from a girl i know
Fez,It would be perfect for switch
Fez,"The game kinda reminds me of Monument Valley,,"
Fez,I think this is free on Epic Games now!
Fez,FREE AT EPIC STORE FROM 22 OF AUGUST TO 29 OF AUGUST
Fez,Im so stuck somewhere in that game. Love it though
Fez,Most relaxing game♥️
Fez,I’m surprised to see so many hating on the game in the comments
Fez,"Why are a bunch of the comments on this video cut off with no ""read more"" option?"
Fez,It's 2018 and I still think this game is amazing
Fez,"Age restricted?
What?"
Fez,"I don't understand why this didn't come out with a solid 10. The review didn't list a single con, only pros and absolute praise. Is it just because ign is trying to make a point that no game is perfect?"
Fez,Fez pocket edition baby!!!!!
Fez,"I Love Fez!



Says Everyone..."
Fez,Best game
Fez,"Fez is one of my favorite games, fish never got the appreciation he needed and just couldn't make another game"
Fez,"Is it just a personal feeling or indie game are a bit over rated ? 
I mean some AAA got sometimes pretty shity notes compared to some Indies that i didn't find so memorable"
Fez,10 Masterpiece
Fez,Fez is such a good game.
Fez,I gana test it now
Fez,People in the comments just can't appreciate the hard work that went into this game - AND the beautiful artwork. Games are not about just shooting at things and everything happening at once. Watch Indie Game on Netflix and I think you'd understand more. He was going for a calming game with lots to explore. I get it's not for everyone but you don't have the right to complain about it. Could YOU make something like this? Would you have the patience to continue with something like this for 5+ years? Could you do better? Probably not.
Fez,This is literally the best game ever. EVER. My mind exploded in the first 3 minutes.
Fez,Retro chic! Love it!
Fez,"Take Super Mario Bros., get rid of all the enemies, take the timer away, eliminate penalty for falling into pits, and you have Fez. The only way you can lose is to stop playing. Great soundtrack though."
Fez,not my type of game but i think my girlfriend will like it
Fez,looks om much like monument VALLEY
Fez,"boring, vapid game. it does not ""reinvent"" any genre lol. if you are talking about oldschool exciting 2d games like mario, then it is WAY too slow-paced to compete or come close to how good mario was. and the puzzles are too easy for it to be a solid puzzle game."
Fez,"its really good game but too complicated.
would've been better just 2d.
and some action and more dialogue."
Fez,playing this in 4k rulez
Fez,mlg pro
Fez,"YOU'RE SUPIR! HEY THERE,$ DETECT EGGNOG   !"
Fez,"Under- Hahahahahaha- Undertale got a 10/10! Hahahaha!








No, but seriously Undertale deserves it. I can't beat Undyne the Undying. Help."
Fez,how much this on psn
Fez,this game is alot like cubic castles nice :D
Fez,Love this game!
Fez,"I'm not a hater but I feel that IGN thinks they are beter ten anyone, I'm not bymyself"
Fez,Why do you rate it 9.5 out of 10 if there's nothin' wrong with it.
Fez,Wow 9.5????!!!!  This game is overrated!  This idea has been done before and the graphics are so so!!!
Fez,porque no le gustan
Fez,fez esta muy bien
Fez,10/10 IGN
Fez,Monument Valley is a superior game that succeeds in any of the failures of Fez. I would recommend instead of Fez the gamers to play Monument Valley instead. I own both games but regret my time spended on Fez
Fez,"Fez has great ideas but none are implemented well or even completed. The art is very nice and that's about it. The developer borrowed the mechanics from other games but failed to understand these mechanics so instead some whale sonar alphabet was created for the game that only the Mad Hatter from Alice in Wonderland can solve if he boiled enough tea from wild mushrooms. The game fails to implement any kind of learning curve in the game play, instead you are left dump founded trying to google solutions to riddles that only idiotic alien brains from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy are capable of creating. This is my honest humble opinion a bout MESS a.k.a. FEZ."
Fez,Cute and detailed pixel 3d Game 😄
Fez,"I bet it was a 9.5/10 because of Phil, what a shame Fez is an AMAZING game :P."
Fez,"Let's ""FEZ"" it!
(Pun intended)

Fez is one of the best game ever made. Regardless if some people don't go for these kind of video game genre, this really is one of the most innovative, creative, and friendly video game created. It has so many interactive elements by and from on its own point of view (like literally it's POV). 
If only I could just get my hands on it, then I'll be like most-very happy. 

Btw, Mr. Jacksepticeye brought me here (not personally, tho). :""3"
Fez,Jättebra spel!
Fez,Twitch emote FailFish references Phil Fish? :D nice
Fez,"Fez is alright. I don't like the developer but I still give him credit for being quite an artist and designer. I love old school inspired games but Fez generally isn't a genre I'm interested in. (Not that I don't like platformer ""find the secrets"" type games -- I love the 2D mario games) -- Fez just doesn't have the elements that keep me going back to platformers. Action, quick reflexes, etc .."
Fez,Alphaomegasin and ReviewTechUSA brought me here
Fez,swag
Fez,"Fez is the best game EVER! I know, I know, it doesn't have 3 dimensional gameplay or 'edgy' gimmicks to attract people's attention. But it has CARE, LOVE, AND ATTENTION put into every detail of it's design, and I for one like Phil Fish more than I did before I played the game. Anyone thinking of getting the game should know that it's an intense ride, despite the soothing facade placed over the world's sunny exterior. And behind the simplistic puzzles is another set of completely ridiculous secrets which require analysis of the entire game world to solve. And I would just like to say that having just finished the entire game a few minutes ago, I say it was well worth the effort, the end was definitely worth the means, and I would recommend it to anybody here."
Fez,Serponge is the reason I'm here
Fez,Too bad the creator is a D-Bag
Fez,so many hipsters in the comments...
Fez,"So sad to see people bitching about this game getting a high score. It's impossible to explain to them why this game is so good. They'll never get it. And, on the subject of Phil Fish, give the guy a break. I don't think he deserves all of this."
Fez,"This game looked boring as shit when i first saw it, but since it was free i gave it a shot. Its actually pretty fun. Thank you ps+"
Fez,"Everyone's angry that the review is about fez and not phil fish... Holy shit the video is clearly titled ""Fez - Video Review"" Why does everyone even care about Phil Fish in the first place?"
Fez,This game looks awesome!
Fez,"This game sucks, its a sub par game"
Fez,"I got fez cus it was on sale on steam, before I watched this review, it's so fun, it maybe one of my favourite games ever. For all those people saying shit about it fickle off muatee, it's really cheap so just go get it, play it and love it it's fucking amazing."
Fez,"I can review this game in two words:
Phil Fish."
Fez,So.. A poor mans Paper Mario?
Fez,"More people should get into the industry of game creation. Check out Mod db for information. It is a shame when creative ideas and innovations are made by total assholes and that is why I would rather play Doom, a game that is  20 years old, than to get a game that boosts the ego of a pile of shit. Peace."
Fez,"Fez really does deserve this 9.5 rating. :D I must say I'm in love with this game, but I may have beat it too fast for my liking. :c I really wish that Fez 2 would happen. But if does or doesn't I still respect Phil Fish for what he did with this outstanding game.  "
Fez,Why 9.5 he didn't say anything bad about it 
Fez,"Why is it ok for all of you to act like asshats but when Fish does, it suddenly becomes wrong?"
Fez,"What are the faults in this game? What's so bad about the game that it deserved -0.5 from the total score? As far as I heard, this reviewer did not touch on cons of the game but yet didn't give it a full score. 
Guess it's because of Phil Fish"
Fez,This is the best platformer-puzzle game i have ever played.. And i only played 30 minutes on my friends laptop.. Strongly reccomend to pick up this game.
Fez,All these haters with no credentials. Keep on hating and doing your job.
Fez,"Shame were not going to get a sequel because ""we don't deserve it"""
Fez,garbage
Fez,"I can't help but think that most of the hate this game is getting is because of people's resentment of Phil Fish. Yes, he's not a very pleasant guy but Fez is an awesome game. Some may disagree with that opinion but judgement of whether the game is good or not should be independent of its creators attitudes. If you don't like Phil Fish then don't buy the game."
Fez,This reminds me of that psp game Crush
Fez,I came back to watch this video to remember a time before we all knew that Phil Fish is a massive fucking douchebag.
Fez,I haven't bought it yet but the demo was so fun so I will probably purchase it this weekend. I remember seeing it in that documentary Indie game: The movie and it looked fun there too. I love how when you start right back where you left off with no finite life system. It is just a super chill game. It kind of mimics the retro experience only better because when I play old games I get really pissed off when I die and don't pick the game back up.
Fez,"""I know people who have played FEZ and have enjoyed the living shit out of it.  Though finding out a lot of things about him(FEZ creator Phil Fish) made me avoid the game completely.  Airborne AIDS that's how I treated FEZ didn't want to have any part of it cuz I'll be fucking damned if I lined your goddamn stinky ass fucking little pockets with my money."" - Alpha Omega Sin."
Fez,"This game is no fun goddam wats wrong with ign 
Ps+ u better watch where u re going 
This shit will not go un noticed 
This game is boring 
Its garbage"
Fez,"I started playing this game last night and I must say, it is absolutely fantastic. This is gaming at it finest.."
Fez,"Sweet, got this for free with my PS plus."
Fez,this game fuckin sucks
Fez,Gives me super paper Mario vibes from the Wii.
Fez,"Appreciate the Simpsons reference.  We'll done, glavin."
Fez,i used to play the demo of the game on my 360
Fez,Jesus that opening song….just stunning …ESO space videos brought me here https://youtu.be/jsJzCSIUHms
Fez,Jesus that opening song….just stunning …ESO space videos brought me here https://youtu.be/jsJzCSIUHms
Fez,"I played Fez on PS4 many years ago, around like 3 or so maybe more and oh my days I can say without a doubt that it is 100% one of if not the best game I have ever played in my life."
Fez,I've played this game countless times on my Ps4 and Ps5. Am just here to tell you all switch users don't pass this up. This is one of my favourite games. Absolutely gorgeous environments and style. One of the best soundtrack of any indie game ever. Smart and creative gameplay. Genius level design. I feel sorry for the people who never played it just because they were so involved with the drama that involved Phil Fish at the time. Seriously who cares lol. Just enjoy the game.
Fez,Super paper mario
Fez,Yes
Fez,@phil fish is the nappa of the gaming community you think he is gone then bam manages to resurface talk a little trash and gone just as fast lol
Fez,I'm still confused
Fez,"remember playing this on the vita few years back, excellent game. The physics and puzzles are amazing!"
Fez,"Everyone who said that you don't wanna support me but you're still buying FEZ guess what you're supporting me. I'm looking forward to filing Content ID on all videos with FEZ gameplay including reviews because if you're making money off of videos with footage of my game it's fucking piracy. Also 1+1 is still 1 because FEZ 2 is still cancelled and you entitled babies who want FEZ 2 can fall in a goddamn hole. Satoru Iwata was a shit CEO. I'm only putting this game on Nintendo Switch as a limited release until I got enough money to pay for my Lamborghini, boat, plane and mansion while you peasants lick my feet."
Fez,"Hey Phil Fish, I thought you said Nintendo was a run by a ""shit CEO"" not too long after that said ""Shit CEO"" died. Now you wanna kiss up to the company that was run by a ""shit CEO"" by putting your game on Nintendo Switch by the way there Phil Nintendo Switch was planned by that ""shit CEO"" before he died."
Fez,I refuse to support games made by that soy filled crybaby who cancels games because of critics on Twitter hurt his feelings.
Fez,"YAY I DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH MY JANKY XBOX 360 CONTROLER ANY MORE!!!
Edit, I forgot the STUPIDEST PUZZLE CALLED THE CLOCK TOWER"
Fez,"And remeber the head dress of this Character belongs to the Moors, And we're back like we never left, ISLAM!!!"
Fez,"I want to play this game, but I don't want to support the creator"
Fez,I love this game. The colors are simply amazing. On the OLED PS Vita's display are just breathtaking !!
Fez,I love fez
Fez,Was Captain Toad inspired by this game? What age range is being targeted for Fez?
Fez,I heard somewhere that phil fish no longer makes money of of this. Is this true?
Fez,I am stuck on 70 %! :)
Fez,Incels do not like Phil.
Fez,"it'y crazy how old this game already is, that most jounger ppl think, it's a totaly new Game."
Fez,2:11 well - except sometimes when you do actually need the one ability the game gates from you
Fez,So what ever happened to Phil Fish?
Fez,I've.... never heard of this game before I might consider getting it
Fez,I want to kill myself every time this guy says hello there you Lovely people.nothing in this world is creepier.
Fez,What if they do make Fez 2. And this is all just buildup?
Fez,I'll buy Fez agaib if they make a physical cartridge. This great game needs to be preserved!
Fez,Reminds me of Super Paper Mario
Fez,Downloaded the game earlier today and I am enjoying it very much!
Fez,how much of the money I were to spend on this goes to Phil Fish?
Fez,Who ported this? Are the devs still active barring he who shall not be named?
Fez,I'm glad I bought this.
Fez,"I really, really want to play this. Hope there will be phyical release at some point."
Fez,Loved the aesthetic but I never got very far before I got stuck going through every area over and over looking for what to do next.
Fez,Of course it's not. It wasn't even that great a game
Fez,"Fez, Hollow Knights, Celeste, Owlboy… It's been *years* since platformers took me more time to complete than a good ol' RPG."
Fez,"I got Fez yesterday on Switch. It's really great (especially the soundtrack), but I take issue with the controls; Gomez is too slow, trying to get off ledges both ways is finicky, as well as jumping up vines. These issues ruin Fez from being amazing for me."
Fez,I'm angry so let me cancel my comment
Fez,Bit of a blast from the past
Fez,I really wish you would waffle more...
Fez,I've bought this game for the PS3 and now again on the Nintendo switch
Fez,Just buy it on Epic games for a couple bucks
Fez,I never thought I would play a video game that taught me how to read a new fictional written language and learn their number system for math as well
Fez,Playing on my Vita 7 years ago
Fez,"Phil, I know you're in the comments, man. Please make FEZ II! lol"
Fez,Instant purchase
Fez,"I never played this game, but I played Captain Toad, so I see Captain Toad borrowed from this game.  I'm interested to pick it up"
Fez,The creator is an asshole. I refuse to give him a dime for this game.
Fez,I love this game SO MUCH! already completed it 3 times
Fez,"Fez is literally one of my favorite games of all time, I was hoping it would come to the Switch since I got the console but never tought it would actually happen."
Fez,10/10
Fez,"Can anyone explain to me why the creator is considered controversial? Because if it’s just because he canceled the sequel after getting into an argument that set him over the edge after years of buildup, then...I don’t really see too much of a problem in that. I’m probably missing something."
Fez,I grabbed it as soon as I saw it. I think I own it on just about every console it’s available on. It reminds me of a great time in gaming. A true classic.
Fez,Nah the creator is a huge asshole. He’s not getting a cent of my money.
Fez,Getting!! Never finished it back in the day.
Fez,I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS CAME OUT IN 2012
Fez,"In short: Do you like Fez? It is worth the buy if you are a big fan.
If you have already purchased Fez, it is the same game. 
If you have not played Fez, you should buy it.
SPOILERS BELOW!!











Note: If you want to find every Anticube, there is a secret code you will have to uncover. good luck."
Fez,Great game...Shame the creators think the fans are annoying and does care if they want a second game. He said so his self I don’t care if you buy my game or not. Don’t believe me. Search for the video. You really want to support that type of game creator?
Fez,my heart still aches for the lost sequel…
Fez,I would totally play this but I beat on the Vita a couple of weeks ago. I did buy it and let my wife try it out last night.
Fez,If the money benefits Phil Fish ima say no its not worth it.
Fez,I reallllly don't want to support this dev though
Fez,I've heard of this game but never played it. I think it's time I finally do!
Fez,Imagine financially supporting Phil Fish. What a disaster.
Fez,"Not gonna buy cuz 
FUCK PHIL FISH"
Fez,Fez!!
Fez,"I've been wanting to buy this game for almost a decade, it's always been sitting there in my wishlists and I think now with the switch version it's finally time 😂"
Fez,My only complaint is that the game world can be difficult to navigate. It can be annoying to find where to go next.
Fez,What happened to Phil Fish?
Fez,Brough this game and used a part of my brain that I thought didn’t exists anymore
Fez,"I think Phil Fish and his team brought forth an incredible work of art, and for that I'm grateful. Y'all gotta let that old shit go, like damn lol"
Fez,One word. Yis
Fez,"YES. Stayed up all night playin' this bitch, easily one of my favorite games of all time! Bro I've literally been waiting on this for years. The whole Polytron team came together and created something so wonderful, from art to music to code/mechanics, kudos to everyone who helped make this gem!"
Fez,"I love you Alex,😂"
Fez,god I love this game (jus sayin)
Fez,I've been waiting for a switch release of this game for years now and finally gave up and bought the steam version last week.
Fez,"Yes



















*Video ends*"
Fez,Played this game on the 360 I highly recommend if you like sidescoller puzzle games
Fez,"I've always enjoyed the atmosphere of this game. The music and the lonely, mysterious feeling, while also staying chill af."
Fez,Literally the review I was searching for
Fez,Are you telling me that Fez has nothing to do with the 11th doctor
Fez,"Ok, I might get it"
Fez,"I'm so terrible at puzzle games, I'm sure I'd struggle with this game. It's like something just shuts off in my brain when trying to solve puzzles, and I have to end up looking up a guide, which defeats the entire purpose. Last puzzle games I tried to play were inbento and Baba is You. But only got about halfway into both games, because I started not being able to solve any of the puzzles in the levels w/out looking up a guide online, so I just stopped playing them."
Fez,I like hearing Alex reading his own review. He is a talented reviewer and should do it more often.
Fez,a must buy if you have not played it 🕹 ♥ 👍🏻
Fez,"I saw SwitchUp's review, and they are delighted with the game. Is it really that good? I might dive in."
Fez,"Nintendo lndie world make it's ideas well Nintendo life, i'm thinking FEZ or very good worth it on switch."
Fez,"I don't know how I didn't hear about this game sooner, seems like a must play!"
Fez,Yeah
Fez,This game is still impressive even today.
Fez,I remember I got bored with it within an hour back on my Xbox and never touched it again
Fez,Just a question cant Polytron make Fez II considering Phill left it
Fez,Didn't the creator of this have a meltdown and pull it from PC?
Fez,These games had my interest but I'll probably never play them😅.
Fez,"Fez is one of my top games of all time and a game I’ve purchased way too many times, but after watching this, I’ll be buying it again. Still a great game."
Fez,fez is always worth it. Lovely game.
What Remains of Edith Finch,😢
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Seems depressing, skip."
What Remains of Edith Finch,The story about Lewis absolutely hit me in the feels.
What Remains of Edith Finch,Looks borin
What Remains of Edith Finch,8.8! This is a 9-10 man. One of the best story telling games ever give it more credit! What’s even got close to this or night in the woods since
What Remains of Edith Finch,Masterpiece. I’m left in awe after it’s over.
What Remains of Edith Finch,Edith Finch is a perfect example of a story that can only be told through gaming. Taking the medium to it's pinnacle. Just excellent.
What Remains of Edith Finch,Gregory Just Made Me Cry Soo much😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
What Remains of Edith Finch,This game is on sale for $6 on Switch. Gonna give it a whirl. 😁
What Remains of Edith Finch,The bathtub stage was sad.
What Remains of Edith Finch,8.8 is not nearly high enough ngl
What Remains of Edith Finch,🥰
What Remains of Edith Finch,Lewis is my favorite story…
What Remains of Edith Finch,Existence is pain.
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Ok, downloaded this from xbox gamepass awhile ago, just finished yakuza 0 last night, so time for something a bit different with a bit different pace.

Looks interesting, kind of like gone home"
What Remains of Edith Finch,This reminds me of The Vanishing of Ethan Carter
What Remains of Edith Finch,"This is one of 3 games which I didn't hesitate giving a 10/10. Truly beautiful, fresh, original and remarkable."
What Remains of Edith Finch,Just finished playing this game on my Switch and I loved it!! I wish it could have gone on longer. Unlike any other game I’ve played!
What Remains of Edith Finch,"If a sequel comes out, and has a collectors edition...well thats a buy"
What Remains of Edith Finch,My favorite game
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Played this for the 2nd time tonight, with my friend who has never played it before. We were both in tears by the end. A true masterpiece that everyone, gamer or not, should experience in their lifetime."
What Remains of Edith Finch,"if you liked this game, check out ""tacoma"" . its from the creators of ""gone home"". one of my favourite games."
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Hello!  I just received ALL THE ASSETS for this game from Epic,..  I am thinking about turning it into a VR game.,  Any interest?"
What Remains of Edith Finch,"The name of this game is actually what prevents me from buying it. The letters popping up are kind of annoying. I mean no offense the voice of the narrator, but I kind of sounds like a spoiled royal brat/princess. Pass."
What Remains of Edith Finch,It's an amazing game. One should experience and be highly immersed with. The story is beautiful
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Might be a piece of art, but for me most boring game I ever played"
What Remains of Edith Finch,"It’s $7.99 on the eshop, definitely getting it!"
What Remains of Edith Finch,"For people thinking to watch the gameplay of this legendary game, tune in to ""HRITHIK 007 "" YT, I have made Complete walkthrough videos of this game ( no commentary) . Thank you."
What Remains of Edith Finch,I cried and i know you did the same :(
What Remains of Edith Finch,"I just noticed that the calendar that says January 2010 in the game is wrong lol as it says that January 2010 started on Thursday when in reality, January 2010 started on Friday"
What Remains of Edith Finch,Just played this on game pass.. if u have it definitely worth playing even if your not a fan of these sort of games
What Remains of Edith Finch,can someone tell me what the game is about? I dont wanna get it i have an ocean fear
What Remains of Edith Finch,This game would have been a true masterpiece with real puzzles or Enigmas to solve in order to progress through the house. Still the storyline is amazing and it’s one of the most original game I have ever played !
What Remains of Edith Finch,Amazing game
What Remains of Edith Finch,If you have a game pass don’t waste your tune in this one..
What Remains of Edith Finch,Really cool game and some very creative gameplay in the small story sections. Highly recommended
What Remains of Edith Finch,I love this game
What Remains of Edith Finch,"8.8!?? This is a freaking MASTERPIECE! Why did you decreased 1.2? It a huge 10!
Really, do tell what was wrong with  it."
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Why does everyone keep saying this game takes two hours to play?  Maybe if you're rushing through it and not reading or listening to anything?  My wife and I have been playing it pretty straight through for two days and at 1.5 hours a day and are only barely close to completing it.
I keep hearing ""two hours""... It sounds like people who have heard reviews from others who are saying you can complete the game in two hours and so they feel obligated to say the same."
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Two games 
1) witcher 3 
2) What remains of Edith Finch"
What Remains of Edith Finch,Oh mad where do I come in?
What Remains of Edith Finch,"""even something as heart wrenching as the death of a child"".... so you mean 90% of these stories?"
What Remains of Edith Finch,Not gonna regret when this came out on PS plus :)
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Im actually suprised that many think this game is bad, like wtf.."
What Remains of Edith Finch,Sad how some movie directors dont consider games art
What Remains of Edith Finch,One of the finest magical realism stories in video game history - 8.8 out of 10 LOL
What Remains of Edith Finch,Best storytelling in video games since Broken Sword era
What Remains of Edith Finch,Nice Story but you can only walk and hear/read. Boring for me
What Remains of Edith Finch,Is this a true story ?
What Remains of Edith Finch,Does it work with vr
What Remains of Edith Finch,Performance dips? LOL. You need to be reviewing with a better pc mate.
What Remains of Edith Finch,This is a 10+ masterpiece.The 8.8 this guy gave to the game is inexplicable.
What Remains of Edith Finch,"this is a 10/10 for me, this game is a masterpiece"
What Remains of Edith Finch,"I played and finished this today. Even hours after I finished, I felt for Edith just like she was a real person. It really got to me."
What Remains of Edith Finch,Underrated. It's easily a 9 and probably more.
What Remains of Edith Finch,This game is a masterpiece!
What Remains of Edith Finch,"I can't bring myself to buy a two hour game for twenty bucks. Although twenty is cheap, I keep thinking 'I can buy FF7 for the same and play into next year'."
What Remains of Edith Finch,Jimmy Fallon sent me here..
What Remains of Edith Finch,"This is a fantastic review of a wonderful game, More people should see more of both."
What Remains of Edith Finch,this game is right behind witcher 3 for greatest story game for me
What Remains of Edith Finch,can’t believe these people made Fortnite
What Remains of Edith Finch,Who's here after Jimmy Fallon's interview with ninja ? 😆😭
What Remains of Edith Finch,who's here bc of ninja on jimmy fallon?
What Remains of Edith Finch,Here coz of Jimmy Fallon
What Remains of Edith Finch,Who is here after jimmy Fallon Recommended this ? 👀
What Remains of Edith Finch,can't believe jimmy fallon brought me here
What Remains of Edith Finch,Who’s here cause of Jimmy Fallon’s interview with Ninja
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Amazing. Utterly amazing. 
Will play it again sometime. Almost wish it was longer."
What Remains of Edith Finch,"I just finished this game.... and all I can say is wow!   What an experience. Pure magic from something so simple. I won't forget this one! Wonderous, magical, eerie, weird, heartbreaking and unique! Even the title itself makes sense at the very end. Amazing."
What Remains of Edith Finch,BORING
What Remains of Edith Finch,Deserves at least a 9.0 not even kidding XD
What Remains of Edith Finch,"At the end , I sat there stunned ...and then proceeded to cry hahah"
What Remains of Edith Finch,"8.8 ""no shooting and enemies like COD"""
What Remains of Edith Finch,"We need more games like this, I'm so sick of these mindless zombie , monsters and straight up Satanic crap that's  been cranked out......
Yes I liked Doom and Resident Evil, but that was decades ago ! 
I'm grown up now and enjoy games that doesn't send me into cardiac arrhythmia 😁"
What Remains of Edith Finch,10/10 in its genre. Period. This game blew me away. Had it over a year on my console but thought it’s a average walking simulator. I was extremely wrong. The stories about each character are touching as hell.
What Remains of Edith Finch,Still to this day one of my favorite games of all time
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Yo anyone want to check out my cartoon? 
StopPlayinn49"
What Remains of Edith Finch,"If you liked this game, it reminded me a lot of Gone Home, check out that game if you like"
What Remains of Edith Finch,I did this in one siting
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Literally just played and finished this game and I loved every moment of it. I love these types of games, this, Firewatch, Vanishing of Ethan Carter, Gone Home etc. they’re so relaxing, it’s like reading a book but instead you’re playing the story, weird to explain but these games just put you in a zen and it’s beautiful. Amazing game."
What Remains of Edith Finch,"If anyone knows anything else the developers created since, please let me know. I really enjoyed this game and can’t wait to see what the came out with next. Best $20 I ever spent."
What Remains of Edith Finch,I was here because of psn plus free game june 2019.... enjoyed the game as well :)
What Remains of Edith Finch,Can u guys recommend me other great games like this? Thanks
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Is there jump scares, pls be honest my heart can’t take it😩"
What Remains of Edith Finch,"So glad this was free with PS4 Plus. This game's storytelling is amazing, heartbreaking(cried multiple times) and beautiful. This wasn't just a game, this was a experience"
What Remains of Edith Finch,This game made me want to go spend some quality time with my family
What Remains of Edith Finch,Bit to short though.. But great game and great story
What Remains of Edith Finch,I kinda wish it was longer. I somehow managed to get connected to Edith in about 10 minutes and wanted more!!
What Remains of Edith Finch,My friends uncle is a main producer for this game
What Remains of Edith Finch,Can you play online
What Remains of Edith Finch,you got much JOY in the last minutes of these peoples life? I had a huge problem with this. psychologically its traumatic and depressing. it ENDS with her dying too. i left the game feeling horrible.
What Remains of Edith Finch,I still need to know What Remains of Marty Sliva
What Remains of Edith Finch,Play speed this game over on my channel the other day I only have one trophy to get in and I'll have them all the one where you look through all the peoples. The game's great though. This was a quick but accurate description of the game. Great job on the video.
What Remains of Edith Finch,A review as lengthy as the game :D
What Remains of Edith Finch,This was really nice to play through. For the length of 2-3h this was easily the best video game story ive ever played
What Remains of Edith Finch,"i really enjoyed playing this magnificent game <3 , unfortunately it's underatted"
What Remains of Edith Finch,Only 2 hours?
What Remains of Edith Finch,Is this a two player game?
What Remains of Edith Finch,Anyone figure out what create mode is?
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Lewis, Calvin and Gregory hit my heart too hard. The other stories were amazing as well but maaaaaan this game will have you thinking about life. 10/10 for sure."
What Remains of Edith Finch,"One of those rare times that I have to disagree with you. I found this engrossing and a great escape. Played this in-between a Witcher 3 replay & Doom 2016. Felt like a nice, pretty deep experience. Much better than many movies that try to stimulate these emotions in the viewer due to it at least being interactive. 

Still favorite reviewer. I got it free a long time ago on PSN, so maybe I’d have felt differently at launch price, but I really enjoyed this."
What Remains of Edith Finch,Played this through today. Found it quite ‘troubling’. Really good experience. More of a book / story that you watch rather than a ‘game’.
What Remains of Edith Finch,"A month or so back I bought The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and this off of the PS store cos they were on sale at something like 4.99 each and they were two games that interested me but not at full price. 

Played Ethan first and wasnt overly taken with it. 

But boy I thought this was absolutely superb. Just finished it earlier today and.i thought it was a great experience. Certainly one of the best walking swim style games that I've played."
What Remains of Edith Finch,"The wrong person gave his opinion, This is THE BEST WALKING SIM GAME"
What Remains of Edith Finch,Thank you so much for the good review (▰˘◡˘▰)
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Well, free for PS Plus."
What Remains of Edith Finch,good review
What Remains of Edith Finch,You should have played this on PC. Everything you complained about is nonexistent on PC. It's like we played two different games. 10/10 game.
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Im a story guy gamer. I love story but this game....... Is it a game? Lol I just beat it and really all honesty this game is not worth any money. If its free okay than but this is just short stories of her family with no real gameplay and that it. You can watch it on youtube and have the same experience. This ""gAmE"" has no puzzles, diff routes, diff ending, action. JUST WALK and that it lol but sometimes your an animal but all liner just move forward and listen to the story.  Oh almost forgot sometimes have to open doors and your book BOOOM amazing Lmaoooo its worse than the walking dead taletail as a game perspective.

Now the story is okay you do feel for them cuz of there bad luck but you dont realllllly care. It wae cool just being in a crazy house. It also weird how rich they are from there crazy house design but they do have a curse so ehhh.

Play it for free or watch it on youtube cuz no I LOVE STORY GAMES but not worth any money in this point."
What Remains of Edith Finch,"While I appreciate the criticism for certain areas of the plot in this game, I really don't understand why reviewers for this genre of video games don't review through the perspective of those that really enjoy this genre. Yes, it might be a niche, but when I played this game I'm comparing to Dear Esther, Everyone's Gone to the Rapture, and to a stretch, maybe even Amnesia a Machine for Pigs, etc. I'm not comparing this to Telltale's Walking Dead because that's more in line with Heavy Rain or Detroit. 
These games shouldn't have to compete for the attention of those who don't find this genre worth playing. 


By the way, as of writing this comment, the game is free for Playstation Plus subscribers - go play it. It only takes about 60-90 minutes to beat and is well worth trying it out."
What Remains of Edith Finch,I’m pretty sure you are one of the only people who just felt kind of meh about this. I just downloaded it for free on PlayStation plus and wished I could give the developers the $20 for it. I thought this was an incredible story and nothing about this game was boring to me. Sometimes it’s just nice to sit back and enjoy something without having to react quickly or do Any other crazy things so if these games offer. This was the first game like this I’ve ever played and now I’m searching the PlayStation store for anymore Great story experiences like this
What Remains of Edith Finch,"It's free this month on PSN and I just finished it in one sitting. Walking sims are usually meh, but this one was really cool. This and Datura tripped me out maaaaaaaan, dude weed lmao.
This game had a lot of really cool parts."
What Remains of Edith Finch,"I played this game today and really liked it. I can't really imagine paying for this game though, got it for free with ps plus. I completed it in one sitting and only once or twice in the 2 hours did I become distracted or slightly uninterested, but for the rest of the time I was very invested as I experienced the very cool and unique things this game has to offer. If you have ps plus download this game now and clear 2 hours, it's also only around 5.5GB so if you're someone like me who doesn't have much space that's a big bonus"
What Remains of Edith Finch,I found it boring and the story itself was pretty pretentious. Glad to see somone doing a review where they aren't praising this game as a gift from above.
What Remains of Edith Finch,I really enjoyed the lack of forced jokes in this one.
What Remains of Edith Finch,Thanks for this video it helped me decide this game probably isnt for me. I played a walking sim before (Gone Home) and got utterly bored by it. So i think this may be a game i pass on. What broug me was wanting to see a bit of what the game was about since its due out this month on PS+
What Remains of Edith Finch,Hard pass. Thanks for the review.
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Thanks, I really had no idea what it played like after the IGN review."
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Games like these, I rather watch the walk through then play the game myself, but it was on sale and I bought. Every f$cking penny worth and would even pay more. This is hands down the best storytelling through 'game simulator'. One get the better of the story if you actually play it yourself."
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Since ""What Remains of Edith Finch"" is now free on the Epic Games store, it means it will find an even larger audience than it did almost two years, ago, hopefully? I disagree with Karak's review. While game play is almost non-existent, it has one of the best overarching narratives and narrative vignettes this type of game deserves, IMO. In fact, it won Best Narrative for the 2017 Video Game Awards. Others have stated if one hasn't experienced some of the main themes and emotions explored by the game... Loss of loved ones, dysfunctional family, Legacy, etc... They aren't going to ""get it"", emotionally, or intellectually. It may seem pretentious, but it's not a typical game that offers up shallow platitudes. Players have to have to bring some life experience(s) and perspective to the game to get the most out of it."
What Remains of Edith Finch,"It is free on EpicGames until Jan 24th, 2019"
What Remains of Edith Finch,It's free now until the 24th of January 2019. I just got it.
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Girl ""game"" with a lot of overly effusive reviews that I've come to expect - and distrust - from gaming scene. Fabulous reviews mean little in gaming anymore."
What Remains of Edith Finch,Just got this game from the epic games store and i have to say it took me by surprise the only other game ive played similar to this was firewatch and i think i like this better
What Remains of Edith Finch,U can get this for free a week from now on epic
What Remains of Edith Finch,This will be free on Epic Games from January 10. I will pick it up. Hopefully it doesn't waste on my power bill too much because I won't be able to get a refund.
What Remains of Edith Finch,"At last, it's on sale in the Xbox store for 10 euro. God that was a long wait, I've been checking all the time and this is the first time it's discounted half price"
What Remains of Edith Finch,"This is probably the most negative review I've seen about this game and I'm not surprised by it at all, in-fact I was wondering why this kind of review didn't exist because I was wondering what it would be like to play this game and not get emotionally attached.

I could be wrong and this is a huge assumtion but I believe its possible the reviewer has had the privilege to not have experience anything similar to what happens in each of the characters stories (not literally, but due to lack of experience, not able to see himself in any of the characters) Most notably with Lewis as with the majority who has played the game are hit the hardest by his story.
This isn't a bad thing, I'm kinda jealous not being able to related to Lewis's story in any way worth noting at least. In fact I'd say that Lewis's story probably has bumped this games review up significantly because of its emotional weight/impact. But if someone can't relate to any of the characters, especially Lewis (and Walter imo) then the game will not be very enjoyable."
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Great review as always but looks like I disagree with you. And that's primarily from being someone who has dealt with mental issues, ponders the meaning of life frequently and had many tough moments. I waited for sale though. I couldn't justify $20 for 2 hours. Looking back I oddly would now haha."
What Remains of Edith Finch,why didnt you start this by explaining what the game is about?
What Remains of Edith Finch,"This ""game"" is amazing, the writing , the story of the family is good if you enjoy good stories give it a try you wont regret it. if you dont enjoy good stories go play call of duty"
What Remains of Edith Finch,Just watch it on youtube for free and you'll get the same experience.
What Remains of Edith Finch,if you don't want performance issues just play it on pc
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Wow. You know this generation of gamers is way too spoiled when you split hairs then split them again. 
Just play it. If you don’t like it, don’t play it. This is the only negative video I’ve watched about this game so I’m sorry, but I’ll go with the majority."
What Remains of Edith Finch,"you should have waited for that steam sale...i got it for like a couple bucks, so it was like $1 an hour of gameplay."
What Remains of Edith Finch,'The Vanishing of Ethan Carter'  'What Remains of Edith Finch'  'Dear Esther' Call me an old curmudgeon but I can't stand these pretentious pompous titles!
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Im not a fan of the telltale games becausr they are cheesy, but life is strange was amazing and after only watching a lets play of edith finch without even playing it myself I thought it was amazing and well done for what it was"
What Remains of Edith Finch,award for best narrative
What Remains of Edith Finch,So it's a movie not a video game.
What Remains of Edith Finch,"I thought it was a brilliant two hours, and for me there was a lot I can relate to having dealt with the accidental deaths of some closest to me. It's always something that happens to someone else until it happens to you. That Edith Finch dealt with such things while still being fascinating and even humourous on occasion is an achievement. It stayed with me.

Definitely worth waiting for sales though, it's a short experience."
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Why these walking sims have these stupid uncreative names? What remains of edit finch, everybody's gone to the rupture, vanishing of ethan cart/ver?"
What Remains of Edith Finch,"""the inhabitants of house 'what-the-fuck' """
What Remains of Edith Finch,Would love to see you do a review of Play Dead's game - Inside.
What Remains of Edith Finch,Damn that Swing part nearly made me upchuck... I never could do swings with my motion sickness
What Remains of Edith Finch,"It seems that if someone enjoyed firewatch then they would enjoy this game, considering I really loved firewatch, I think this one is definitely worth a shot. Probably pick it up on the next sale and try to get it done in one sitting."
What Remains of Edith Finch,Looks boring and too short. Will skip buying this. Does not really seem playable. Considerate and fair review though there does not seem to be much to this game but I guess the Walking Simulator (outside of Sports Games) is the one genre of Video Games I dislike.
What Remains of Edith Finch,"For me this is THE best game the genre has to offer, and is one of the strongest statements you can present for the games-are-art argument. I used this game on several occasions to show my non gamer friends/relatives what gaming can mean besides shooting things and swearing loudly, and not one person has walked away without being at least a little bit impressed."
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Shoul have waited for yoour analisis,.. this game should be 10 usd at most,.. short and not really  fun,.. by short ,.. I mean that gay get  home game is better,"
What Remains of Edith Finch,"this was overpriced,... almost don't care for reviews,.. payed like 49 or something,.. worse money spent Hour per / enyoiment you have better games for this price,.. there is reason i think this is shit,... Storybook that basically isn't. (nihalist may like it) but please dont give money to those fuckers"
What Remains of Edith Finch,"@ACG: I linked your Pyre review to some one and they said it didn't exist. so I came here and its not here. I was wondering if i dreamed of watching your review for Pyre but then i saw the ink at the end of this review to Pyre review.
you deleted it? why? Is super Giant game bothering you about your review? the review was positive so why is it removed?"
What Remains of Edith Finch,virtual tours aren't games.  Not interested.
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Ahhh walking sims. I could never really enjoy them. Tried a bunch of them, but in the end they were all just pretentious shit, kinda like modern art in my opinion."
What Remains of Edith Finch,Can we expect a fortnite review?
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Will there be a Fortnite review soon ? 
I only trust 2 reviewers ... and one of them is busy at coxcon :D"
What Remains of Edith Finch,"This looks like a great visual novel. Not a ""game"", and certainly not something I'd pay for."
What Remains of Edith Finch,Edith Finch is f'n amazing!
What Remains of Edith Finch,"It is the first review I don't agree with totally. I admit I am biased and I can see that 20$ is way too much. But there are some uniqiue bits in this game and I feel like it is not getting enough credit (from you). Which is strange. I mean you are in parts really positive about this game. Maybe I wanted to hear ""Wat for sale but goddamn get this game."" I was just so amazed by it."
What Remains of Edith Finch,Late review didnt this game came out like couple months ago or something.
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Thank you for announcing this is a walking simulator, this way I was able to stop and find another one of your videos to watch :)"
What Remains of Edith Finch,"It was the best walking sim I've played.  Kinda like walking through a Wes Anderson movie; without the deadpan humor.  I disagree about the graphical/visual experience, it's spot on.  Every nook and cranny was designed to show that real people with multiple quirks and interests lived there.  Definitely a must buy."
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Thanks for yet another review, Joe."
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Lol, loved the comment at the end. I will surely support you on patreon once i finish some debts. Love your work"
What Remains of Edith Finch,Can you do fortnite im really torn on it should I buy it or wait for the free one in 18
What Remains of Edith Finch,"l've bought this game l've beat it in less than 2 hs and l refunded it ,no point in walking simulators"
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Great review as always, seen several people's stances on this and love that comment at the end; seems to be the end-all of dissent lol. Though, I have to say that the swing scene in the video legitimately gave me vertigo which I assume is part of the intended effect in the game. Interesting in retrospect but, not so great in the moment."
What Remains of Edith Finch,Sup kerik  xoxo
What Remains of Edith Finch,Lewis!
What Remains of Edith Finch,"What Remains of Edith Finch looks like an interesting game that places a heavy emphasis on story and exploration. That's fine with me as long as the narrative is well told and the exploration is fun. I'll admit that I'm usually not into walking simulators, with the exception of a few games, this one included. The thing with walking simulators/exploration games is that they have to have enjoyable aspects such as, interesting and cool locations to visit, a good story and of course, the exploration itself has to be fun and worthwhile. I think that for the most part, this game succeeds in those areas. I'll definitely be giving this one a shot. Thanks a lot Karak for another solid review!"
What Remains of Edith Finch,game looks trippy as balls!
What Remains of Edith Finch,"I disagree, I think Edith finch is the best ""walking simulator' yet. You get to play what you're reading so there's different gameplay throughout the whole game. I find games like Gone home and Dear esther quite boring because they tell you right on the page. Here you get to interact with the page. To each is own I guess. Good review as always though. The frame rate issues in the first outdoor section are really bad. At least when I played it."
What Remains of Edith Finch,The game is like firewatch it focuses on the story and artstyle
What Remains of Edith Finch,"I agree. This was a story book, but with interaction added and designed to better immerse you in the character's stories. The small amount of interaction is only there to get people to relate to the characters (and their deaths) on a more personal first-person perspective.

Edit: To be clear, this is why I actually really enjoyed it. I really like books and this felt like an elevated book to me rather than a lacking video game. But it all depends on your perspective."
What Remains of Edith Finch,I'm surprised you didn't mention that the bad audio and voiceovers during the comic book might have been on purpose. I thought they were trying to go for the feel of a budget horror TV show or B movie.
What Remains of Edith Finch,"LOL ""gameplay?? There is barely any""  Great review karak 😀"
What Remains of Edith Finch,This game has been out for ages! Stop with the boring indie crap and review FFXII remaster!!!!!!!
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Absolutely amazing game, in my opinion. One of the best experiences I had with gaming this year. If you played it, make sure to check Joseph Anderson's hour long video about it, its worth it."
What Remains of Edith Finch,"I think this game is beautiful and the story is amazing, but you don't have to own it, to enjoy it, I watched a let's play and enjoyed it just as much as I would have if I had done it myself."
What Remains of Edith Finch,"speaking of Telltale games, the current Humble Bundle is all about those games. if you enjoy them and don't own most of them, now is the time to spend 15 bucks and get a lot of them. some crucials like Wolf Among us are missing, but there are more items to be announced, maybe those will pop up.
or spend about 8 and ignore the batman and minecraft games and take everything else."
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Love the amount of reviews, but make sure you don't get burnt out and end up phoning them in."
What Remains of Edith Finch,"I forgo about this one. It still looks like a nice experience, but if it's too expensive; I'll wait:)"
What Remains of Edith Finch,Looks like Firewatch being a walking sim. That game was so gripping though 
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Yeah, I just can't get into these. And I can't really call them games. Somewhere in the void between a movie and a game. 

Which is fine for those that do enjoy this type of experience. Seems like it does some things right."
What Remains of Edith Finch,Another quality review as I've come to expect from you Karak. Just curious what happened to the old school intro you used to have?
What Remains of Edith Finch,just a walking sim...
What Remains of Edith Finch,"I could hear the smile as you peaced out on this one lol.

Plan on doing a Sundered review? Pretty please?"
What Remains of Edith Finch,"You should add ""watch on YouTube"" on your rating scale, because that's what it sounds like we should do."
What Remains of Edith Finch,"I loved firewatch, returned vanishing of Ethan cater for 3 bucks back after steam sale...I hope I'll like this."
What Remains of Edith Finch,"walking sims a rather specific type of games. They heavily rely on the story, and can they keep you interested in it, if that element is not great than some other needs to be for me to like the game - Gone Home most overhyped and overrated game in my opinion, Firewatch was great due to the comminication between the two main characters, Vanishing of Ethan Carter great graphics and ok story overall OK. SOMA - I expected more, the story was a copy of a copy of a copy of a heavily used theme in SF books/movies. 
Edith? I will wait for deep sale to try this one out."
What Remains of Edith Finch,"as this is what people would call a walking simulator that mostly bases itself on its story, woudnt it be best to talk about that in a review instead of game play features which it mostly is lacking. talk about what fiction it relates to and more of the vibe it'll give the key story points and what not. or maybe im just saying this because i disagree with the conclusion of your review. either way by the way your presented the game it sounded like a boring story aimed at people who hate reading."
What Remains of Edith Finch,Way better than I had expected. I love a good story I could care less what the gameplay is. A good story is worth the experience. The fact that the visuals are also great and music is spot on A+ 8/10 from me.
What Remains of Edith Finch,Firewatch FTW! Seriously though that game is really good and has a deep meaning.
What Remains of Edith Finch,I really do not understand the appeal to these types of games.
What Remains of Edith Finch,Looks like a good ps+ title otherwise I probably won't ever play it
What Remains of Edith Finch,"(potential spoilers)

Played the game with my mom sitting next to me a couple nights ago on the ps4. She was okay with it because it didnt have any fighting, lol.

I gotta say I was disappointed by the story though. It seemed like it wad building up to no pay off and the developers didn't goes as far as they should have when it comes to some of the themes. 
Its like pushing yourself only 90% as hard a you should have gone in a workout; good job you did great but they're was still more potential that you didn't use.
And I definitely have to agree, as interesting as the 2 hours where, they aren't worth the full 20 dollars."
What Remains of Edith Finch,I really want to play this game but it's really expensive even on PC. I didn't buy it during the Steam Summer sale because it was only discounted like $5. I'll wait until it comes down to $10 or less.
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Don't care for the game, just here to watch the review since this is one of the better (Or best?) review youtube pages."
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Edith Finch is the best walking sim I've played however, it's important to know that it's first and foremost, a story. It's linear, there's no failure state, and it's the same story told every time you play it, but that's the genre. It's story is told excellently though and I actually thought the ""gameplay"" of the individual stories was very well done and creative. I really enjoyed how it was always a different mechanic for every story as well."
What Remains of Edith Finch,Hey if you're willing to do older game reviews - would you mind reviewing hollow knight? The game you previewed to us a while back?
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Think this is the first game I've disagreed with you on but I completely understand and even agree at a lot of points. While it is a 'Walking Sim' I think how it puts you into their shoes and the 'Fish' scene is maybe one of the best examples of putting you into the shoes of another person and actually losing yourself to the moment and scene. 

Like I said I completely understand where you're coming from and one again you're my favorite reviewer around so keep up the good work my friend! If you have the time too I'd highly recommend Joseph Anderson's video on Edith, while long I think it does a great job of showing off just how good the story is."
What Remains of Edith Finch,Loved this game!  It's quite the tear jerker.
"Papers, Please",just bought this game over christmas and new years 2022 so its 2023 and i can say this game made me feel things i have never felt before
"Papers, Please",Good game
"Papers, Please","wow, bad take"
"Papers, Please",Good review
"Papers, Please",Glory for Arstotzka.
"Papers, Please",This was an amazing review tbh
"Papers, Please",Glory to Arstotzka
"Papers, Please","Happy to say that 8 years later, this is still one of the greatest games ever made."
"Papers, Please",They should make a Mexico/USA version with today’s 2019 politics
"Papers, Please","I like this game a lot due to how much I can relate to the people standing in line, I never understood why immigration office/border patrol lines went on for so long, but now I kind of do.

I am an immigrant, I have been on the that long long long waiting line with my family and denied entry multiple times, but I guess that's why I enjoy it, because I can relate..."
"Papers, Please","Lol, sounds like you need to get good."
"Papers, Please",Off to the gulags with you. Glory to Arstotzka
"Papers, Please",I think I'll let you no hurry I think the other countries only one is when is communist and it's not arstotzka actually it's neighbors only one the Border Wichita shared West west of there of their city which has their checkpoints West greston
"Papers, Please","The game is obviously meant to invoke your rant, it's political commentary. It is ""entertaining"" but it's not ""fun""."
"Papers, Please",Cough...tsa...cough
"Papers, Please",When was the game released - 1980?!?  The graphics look worse than diabolical.
"Papers, Please",Loved working as a spy for the resistence :D I recomend doing that ending first
"Papers, Please",This game got a little too real for you
"Papers, Please","you did the ezic route, didn't you"
"Papers, Please",what a crap looking game
"Papers, Please","One of the biggest feelings that break through when you play this game is...




Guilt"
"Papers, Please","I must say, I never really had to many problems with difficulty in Papers Please."
"Papers, Please","By day 21 I have a good $215 saved up from alternating between giving my family food and heat (with $5 every other time for son's medicine). No new apartment, no present for son (his drawing just gets in the way of my desk), just upgrades for work. I saved more money in a virtual communist country than I ever have in real life."
"Papers, Please","Me playing Papers, Please while listening to the video."
"Papers, Please","i feel like George's rant at 4:47 is precisely the feeling the game wants to invoke, especially his feelings to the country and his supervisor."
"Papers, Please",glory to Arstotkza
"Papers, Please",3:29 It's a 3d platformer
"Papers, Please",Glory to artozka
"Papers, Please",im no teacher but i think this would be a good game for a high school global history class during the fall of communism it would make the students interested in the subject matter and help them see the hardships faced by ppl during this time
"Papers, Please",ARSTOTZKA CAN INTO SPACE
"Papers, Please","I spent the $5 when it was on sell, but still would be worth even the $10."
"Papers, Please",That sarcastic rant was hilarious!
"Papers, Please",fantastic review~!!
"Papers, Please",music from beginning?
"Papers, Please","4:48 that is the point
( though I suspect you KNOW that )





PURCHASE!!!!!"
"Papers, Please","Super bunnyhop gave a great review of this game except for 1 point; This game is only 10 bucks and is TOTALLY WORTH IT! Its a lot of fun and i play it on a weekly basis and ive owned it for 2 years now. If you're into this type of game ten bucks is a damn good investment. 


great review and game other than that little gripe of mine though!"
"Papers, Please",I guess the dot matrix printer sound remind you of Carmen Sandiego. It sure did forme.
"Papers, Please","I just followed protocol, and then got arested... then I helped the order, and got arested.... BEST GAME 10/10 -IGN"
"Papers, Please",i loved that game!
"Papers, Please",This game is so better and satisfying then shooting russians with exoskeleton abilities and trying to survive Waves of enemies (*cough* Call of Duty)
"Papers, Please",This was a very well done review
"Papers, Please",Yes omfg that noise of the fucking pink paper slip lol
"Papers, Please",OK your criticism has been noted your behavior will get you in to real troubel Mr bunnnyhop (pressing detain button under desk) beep beep you going to labor camp of arztotzka for ten years have fun hammering rocks you fool Glory to Arztotzka
"Papers, Please","Super Bunnyhop speak negative of wonderful Arstotzka Government. Without glorious Arstotzka he make no money. Arstotzka give him opportunity. yet still he criticizes. Maybe Super Bunnyhop prefer Gulag? We soon find out, yes?

Glory to Arstotzka!"
"Papers, Please",Welcome to modern capitalism.
"Papers, Please","....
I had over $300 by the end of the game with all family members, and I think a level 5 apartment."
"Papers, Please",Jorji is best character of this game
"Papers, Please",GLORY TO ARSTOTZKA!
"Papers, Please",ill never forget handing the code over to the officer when he asked if the rebels had contacted me. only to be shot minutes later for acts of treason. i was trying to help :(
"Papers, Please",Dat Music... it's been 2 years since i played the game and the sound still gives me the creeps
"Papers, Please","Who watched a ""We love Russia"" video after this?"
"Papers, Please","Actually, the city the game takes place in is called ""east grestin"", and there's a ""west grestin"" in a neighboring country (presumably on the other side of the border). This means that it's likely meant to be Berlin pre-wall-fall."
"Papers, Please","Or you look at them and say ""rapist."" And let them through."
"Papers, Please","i love this game. i get to catch a glimpse on what life really was like in the soviet union. also seeing jorji constantly get himself in trouble with drug trafficing to the point that he knows many of the guards is hilarious. i even got to let sergio, one of the boarder guards reunite with his love.

i play this game not for its repetition, or to pass thetime, i play this game like its a role-playing game. i visualize myself wearing a soviet-esque Arstotzkian inspector uniform with Ushanka on my head and a shiny badge.
i sneer at those who try to outsmart me, but show minimal kindness to those who realy need it-so long as my citations are not 1 too many.

when terrorists attack, i shoot them with tazer rifle, and get sharpshooter bonus.

then have smile on my face as i walk home, knowing that my step-mother died from sickness 12 days ago, so that is one less mouth to feed.
and now i can serve my country better with new booth upgrade."
"Papers, Please","Lol it says it's genre right up front. ""A Dystopian Document Thriller"""
"Papers, Please","It's interesting how a game with DOS era graphics and practically no production value made by one guy can be waaaay more immersive and fun than AAA blockbusters with budgets in the $ millions made by hundreds of of industry specialists.I was sweating from the concentration to check as many papers as I could, and got friggin angry for real at an imaginary country for practically holding my family hostage to make me process paperwork.I was actually exited to see where the story of all those people will lead. Was that one guy reunited with his wife, who are these shady people leaving me coded messages, will my letting that one guy with fake documents through make the front page in next days's paper, etc. This tiny little game with ancient visuals and not much else, could make me care for a nameless, faceless worker dude and the wellbeing of his family way more than I ever cared about any AAA protagonist, ever.

When I see games like this, I can't help but say ""Yes, THIS is what video games should be like"" and not that bloated, overhyped thrash-heap of QTE simulators that are being made with budgets surpassing a small country's entire GDP, and about as fun and entertaining as watching flies circling a pile of dogshit."
"Papers, Please",I don't think anyone who lived in a Stalinist dictatorship can view it the same as anyone in the first world.
"Papers, Please","This game is way more fun than it might seem.

I highly recomend it

9/10"
"Papers, Please","This game is way more fun than it might seem.

"Papers, Please","""So fuck you, fuck this country, fuck this job.""

How I feel after papers please"
"Papers, Please","God damn, such a good review, so funny too!
Downloading it now."
"Papers, Please","an excellent rewiev, sir, yes sir, yes."
"Papers, Please",I love this game so much. I can't really explain why though. It's just awesome.
"Papers, Please",hmm seems the mundane daily grind genre is really picking up steam with this and cart life.
"Papers, Please",This is one of the best reviews I have ever heard.  Keep up the great work.
"Papers, Please","Well, the game is a superb simulation of paper work, and one that needed to be made. Having said that, I'm not sure how much I would call the game 'good'. The game's somewhat doomed by it's concept alone, buuuut, it manages to work wonders within its restraints (and is, if nothing else, unique). I feel like this game started with a skilled developer feeling cocky and said ""I can make a game about ANYTHING. Try me""."
"Papers, Please",I absolutely loved the segment where you ranted about your in game job!
"Papers, Please",I absolutely loved the segment where you ranted about your in game job!
"Papers, Please",I'm not going to buy the full version simply because I don't feel that the $10 is worth the minor improvements and added content... and because I don't have $10 to spare :(
"Papers, Please","This video was great, I love your videos so much SBH... but gods you are not at all good at this game"
"Papers, Please","The one flaw I have with this game is its pacing. I think 3-5 days of flat ""work"" between story events would have been more than enough time to get the point across of ""Damn! This job is tough! I've got a wife and kids to feed! What the hell do you people want from me?!"" I recall going over a WEEK with nothing happening, and forgot what the point of all the work was until the next story event."
"Papers, Please",Very well written review. This is the first of your videos I've watched and i subscribed right away.
"Papers, Please","Your rant was great, that's pretty much how I felt at times."
"Papers, Please","This is one of the most interesting and pressing cases of games as art IMO. Other ""Art"" games try to do some weird visual stuff, but Papers, please gives you a true interactive experience and somehow its 16 bit graphics manage to perfectly immerse you in the world."
"Papers, Please",Omg spoilerssss
"Papers, Please",Fantastic review! 
"Papers, Please","I have mixed feelings about this game, but I will say it did put a lot and accurate effort into making what seems like paperwork into a good game."
"Papers, Please","Perfect review, this might be your best review video "
"Papers, Please","i got the game, its awesome, liked it alot"
"Papers, Please",subscribed :o
"Papers, Please","awesome review man, i subbed! :D"
"Papers, Please",this review was soooooooo entertaining for some reason
"Papers, Please",Just bought this and it's great fun.
"Papers, Please","""Work your ass off"" Simulator....."
"Papers, Please","This reminds me of the original Oregon Trail.  You made decision in that game, which had consequences such as forgetting to hunt causing someone to go hungry, or not resting enough killing a member of your family who contracts a disease.  All you did was watch your little wagon, but the overall experience was pretty fun."
"Papers, Please",Glory to Arstotzka!
"Papers, Please",when you started playing fight the power i laughed so hard! :D
"Papers, Please",Great review! earned a sub.

"Papers, Please",That moment when a swedish man who lives in japan does a russian accent in english
"Papers, Please",15:06 is crazy now since he's actually having a son now!!
"Papers, Please",this game seems like tat heaven and hell play god kind of game
"Papers, Please",Lol I like how his accent goes from Russian to Italian

"Papers, Please","Girl: please help me his name is Ludum dari
Pewds: what a suspicious photo of Ludum dari.. Anyway you can pass"
"Papers, Please","So stressful to sometimes watch Pewds play games like these, he doesn't take it that seriously and misses details. So frustrating to watch that I need to watch another youtuber do it instead. Sigh."
"Papers, Please",Always watching this
"Papers, Please",“I won the labor lottery and now i menstruation” beautiful words
"Papers, Please",This accent looks more italian than russian 😂
"Papers, Please",Glory to Arstotzka
"Papers, Please",4.05 and this is a perfect example of why the concept behind a video game barely even matters at all

"Papers, Please","There are 3 names. Last name (surname), Your name, father's name. Also father's name. Where is the father's name? Hmm"
"Papers, Please",Pewds when he sees something suspicious : *GASP*
"Papers, Please",God I miss these times

"Papers, Please",14:28 PASSPORT SAYS SHE NO WAMEN
"Papers, Please","Pewdiepie is best Admission Personnel, Glory to Arstotzka."
"Papers, Please","Papers, please."
"Papers, Please",Resistance is The People's birthright. This game does a good job of illustrating why it's right to hate the state. And it does so by putting you in the position of a low-level functionary of the oppressive socialist state apparatus. Even the victimizers are victims of the collectivist system. The iron-heeled jackboot stomps upon us all. [ironically cue System of a Down's 'P.L.U.C.K.']

But hey, at least you'd get the 12 right :D."
"Papers, Please","4:41, Одиннадцать/Adeen'natzit = 11
If you meant 12, it's

Двадцать/Dvanatzit = 12"
"Papers, Please","2:00, ""До Свидания"" - ""Do Svedanja"", means Goodbye.

До/Do = To
Свидания/Svedanja = Date.

So the literal translation is
""To Date"", which probably means to later.
So kinda like ""I'll see you later"" - in English."

The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Most comments here clearly don't even understand what the game is lmao
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Undderated
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Its a hallwway speedrun talking simulator. Totally not even worth $10. Everybody highly rating this crap in the comments are obviously new to games and should feel ashamed recommending money be spent on it.
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"IGN are woke anti-gamers, if you subscribe to them then you are part of that, join ACG if you want truth."
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,such an unpleasant voice horrible
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,So is it like a horror game?
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,This looks boring af
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"Spoiler alert? Hell no!
BUT thanks for the warning, much obliged"
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"They gave this game a 9. It looks ok but boring at the same time. In my opinion, ""Greenhell"" is a better than this game!"
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"The reviewer is ""reviewing"" the console version because of all the additions then a big disclaim comes up at the end saying it was on pc.


IGN FULL OF IT AS USUAL"
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,His first party member was amber heard
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,How long is the game in total? Does it have replay value??
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,This would have been a great upgrade to include ray tracing...
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Narrator best boy
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Didn't really explain what the game is at all. literally just talked about the reissue features.... Not a surprise IGN put out another shitty review
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"What crap game is this, if its a game at all. Irritating narrator, no objectives and aimless wandering. This is supposed to be smart?"
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Worst hype ever…
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"Finally, a review that wasn't a 7."
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"The ultra deluxe is just like the new content you get at the start.
You can choose to waste all your jumps and get disappointed fast.
Or save them, and cherish each one, so when the new content finally ends, you may feel sad and dissapointed about the experience, but nevertheless you enjoyed it."
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,You know what . . .  this would be so perfect for VR.
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Not a fan of these kind of games but the name wants me to play..
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,This makes me want a 'Severance' video game
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Looks like waiting five years for a console release was worth it for me
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,I’d say it has Buckets of new content 😉
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"If you have never played the game before, surely, 8/10. But if you have, imo this is a 6/10 as there're so much of replaying the old stuff."
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,boring game bye bye
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Backrooms mod when?
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,6:08 never gets old
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,The biggest thing of 2013 has returned
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,This game is great for people called Jim
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,It should have gotten 10/10 to be honest
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"the Stanley Parable was the liminal space, before the liminal space meme became a thing."
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Never heard of the game before but all i'm seeing is just walking around this review did nothing to convince me to play it
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"First thing before playing, you have to adjust the field of view (around 60 is fine) in the settings to get rid of the fish eye effect. Happy playing!"
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Kinda disappointed by those dumb sidekick characters
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,This game really makes me think what exactly make something a game?
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Markiplier just needs to play this now.
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,So what is the best console to play this games? Does it running smoothly on switch?
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"ooohhhh, did you get the broom closet ending? the broom closet ending was my favourite!
edit: why is this comment freaking people out. you guys obviously didnt play the game..."
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"In case anyone was wondering, this is the best video game currently available ☺️"
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"It is a bit if a dissapointment that the Narrator does not make use of the console's unique characteristics.

For example. Maybe he can say something about scanning an amiibo or using the move controller or about the switch's portability."
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Don’t forget to tell people it only takes 20 minutes to complete the game
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,This game was worth every single penny
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,So it makes you feel like Stanley
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,هاذي اللعبة الزينة مش ألعاب القيم باس الأخيرة المخيسة
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Is there going to be a physical version of this?
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,4:15 lol
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,It just doesn't feel genuine in Unity instead of Source. Source is just more honest and transparent to the user.
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Does it contain puzzles that you need to be a rocket scientist to solve?
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,this has to be one of the best most entertaining games i’ve ever played. Best $25 i’ve ever spent
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,I've just finish Severance on Apple TV so I'll definitely play this for sure
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Game of the year
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"It's funny that in the Switch version (and possibly the other console versions) instead of Steam Reviews the canisters say ""Pressurized Gas"" reviews."
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,What do you do just walk around and read stuff?
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,But have you found the b—-m c——t ending….?
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Looks kinda like _The Backrooms: The Game._
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Give Overwatch 2 beta a review😃
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"If any other ''game'' would congratulate itself on the awards it received while also mocking any sort of criticism, it would be panned. But since its so quirky self aware it gets away with it. This just seems like a Walking simulator you''ll play (or rather walk) once and then never again, so of course IGN would like it"
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,This review will ruin quite a few suprises GO INTO IT BLIND
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Great 👍.
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,8
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Worth 20 pounds? Idk for a walking sim seems a bit much...
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,might have to play this version...question my existence again...
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"Great review, really convinced me to give it a try :)"
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Is it on console?
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Just got the escape pod bucked deluxe edition ending
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,And to think that this started out as a Half-Life 2 mod.
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Why make a spoiler filled review?
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Could you cool it with the adverbs and adjectives Mr Reviewer guy
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"Come on friends, let's follow the Stanley Parable TM Adventure Line"

The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Severance: The Game!
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Severance made this thing relevant again.

The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Do they have some kind of achievement tracking on Switch?
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Early
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,WOOOOO
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,lettsssssss goooooooo finally
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Is it complementary to be early?
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Go watch sage fighters
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Okay
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,This game is giving me Severance vibes
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"5:00 ""with bad-faith players realising they can weaponise social media to demand changes to games""

Wow. GameSpot needs to realise that G@merGate were the good guys. They're like the Mitchell and Webb sketch ""Hans, are we the bad guys?"" at this poiint.
Yes, you were in the wrong GameSpot. Fairly sure you were one of the outlets that released the ""gamers aren't your audience"" propag@nda.
Stanley Parable needs to do another expansion to make sure they comment on the weasel gaming media companies. They're pretty disgusting."
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Thanks for the spoilers. 😑 Is it so hard to put a warning at the start of the video? That's the last time I'm going to watch a Gamespot review
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Displaying a review of Gamespot from memory lane in a actual Gamespot game review..... _what is that mean?_
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Narrator best boy
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"The fact the reviewer states they need to play the game again ""to reach other outcomes"" fundamentally illustrates that the reviewer either is lying to us or doesn't seem to want to understand/accept the concepts this game is presenting."
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"wow. it's like their joke at the game awards 2020(or was it 2019) is gonna come true with the Stanley Parable ultra deluxe. finally going to get it's Game of the Year award without competitors like ""the last of Us part 2"""
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"If you haven't played this game, don't. 
It doesn't do anything, or teach you anything, you don't even feel good playing it. 
Hopefully you are the compliant type like I was. I was told not to play it, so I didn't."
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"""The end is never the end is never the end"" could be read in two ways. It could be read as 'the end is never', in a kind of scary way. It could also be read as 'the end is never the end'. They are both relating to the fact that even if you reach the ""end"" of the game, there will always be more ends."
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,PLEASE play the game before watching the review. massive spoilers ahead
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,this vid will be in the next game
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Is this game actually as good as people say? It seems highly pretentious.
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Video Game Journalists love the Stanley Parable
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,The trophy list for this is the most jacked thing I've ever seen hahah
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Reminds me of Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy with the narrator
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"In the PC version, the Steam reviews part just calls it ""Steam."" I had no idea it was called ""Pressurized Gas"" on console. That's hilarious."
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Bad faith players?  Grow up man.
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"Hey there! This game was made by ""Crows Crows Crows"" and they collaborated with ""Pillow Castle"", who also have made a game called ""Superliminal"". Superliminal a very well made illusion-puzzle-dreaming cycle game, which is probably also my favourite haha. Even the devs themselves said it is the best game they have ever made! You should 100% try it. I can promise, it's much better than expected at first. It's simply amazing, no doubt about that. Hope you/anyone read(s) this and play(s) it!"
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"​7:31 That ""Perfect for the Switch"" meme reference at the end lol."
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,ITS NOT A SEQUEL
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,It’s a rehash with extra salt
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"00:28 Not only did they hide the sequel in the re-release of the original game, they also hid the DEMO for that sequel in the rerelease."
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"It is a bit if a dissapointment that the Narrator does not make use of the console's unique characteristics.

For example. Maybe he can say something about scanning an amiibo or using the move controller or about the switch's portability."
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,$25 is just way too much for a glorified rerelease of an old game with 3 or so extra hours of content.
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,You talk about change yet look at games like siege that only usually change for the small percentage (ie pro league) instead of the most common player base.
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,5:24 pressurized gas ? in my playthrough it was literally steam. How ?
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,pressurized gas???
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,I’ve never played this game before so I’m really looking forward to getting hold of it on a device I own
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,But have you found the b—-m c——t ending….?
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"Considering the game in between the Stanley Parable and the Ultra Deluxe version was the Beginners Guide, I'm not surprised by this turn whatsoever and am fully anticipating getting more great gut punches about what it's like to be a creator and the ups and downs of that"
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Do you want to know how gamespot scores their reviews? They take whatever score IGN has and subtracts a point. Don’t believe me? Look it up for yourself.
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,So you gave an 8 just for a laugh or is there a more sinister message hidden there?
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Has there been any truly new AAA games since 2013?
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"Ok, all I needed is the first sentence. Thanks!"
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Hopefully it will arrive on game pass I doubt I buy it unless it’s on sale.
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Shortest play time for a review I've seen yet. But I don't doubt this type of game is quite short and that there's plenty to discuss.
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Dang I played this for free in rec room vr haha this is what it all looked like no difference at all
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"The game was perfect, but since they couldn't just make a port and went on to add shiny new content, they lose a point. 😂😂😂"
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Severance: The Game!
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,I bet the reviewer got a kick out of seeing their original review in the game
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,The best walking simulator ever. Prove me wrong.
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"Probably one of the best DLCs since The Outer Wilds: Echoes of the Eye, or possibly even Dragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen. Love that they added so much content whilst underplaying how much there was to it."
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Do they have some kind of ending/achievement tracking on Switch?
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Excellent review. ♥️
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Did you get the broom closet ending? That one was my FaVoRiTe
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,I wonder if there's a Backrooms Easter egg. Probably not but would be cool
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,god this guys fast
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,sheesh
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,Second
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,First
Cuphead,"Just a quick reminder how bad IGN reviews are:
CoD: Ghosts and Cuphead have the same score of 8.8! Ah, and CoD: Black Ops 3 has 9.2... Yeah..."
Cuphead,This game is amazing and I’m horrible at it!
Cuphead,It has a little something for everyone.
Cuphead,First comment in August
Cuphead,You get .more health  on King dice stage
Cuphead,10 for me
Cuphead,3/10 Because the gamers love it -IGN
Cuphead,"I’m really upset that somehow IGN ranked Fortnite, of all games, a full .8 points above this game. That feels insane to me."
Cuphead,Come on its a ten basically there negatives are its to hard sometimes and you can't change your load out in a level.
Cuphead,this is what happens when you're really passionate about what you do.
Cuphead,"Cuphead's unfair features are what make it such a difficult game, without the challenges, it wouldn't receive such a great rep"
Cuphead,Wow!!
Cuphead,CUPHEAD’S MY LIFE!!!!!!!
Cuphead,Easier than Mega Man X
Cuphead,Minecraft is better losers
Cuphead,"Thia is the game ever gamer NEEDS to play once, not one they necessarily WANT to. It betters you as a player."
Cuphead,no
Cuphead,"Damn, that artstyle brings back allot of memories man... Just looking at it is pure joy of Nostalgia...💪💪💪"
Cuphead,"""Whenever you mess up, it makes it feel like your fault, not Cuphead's"" 
*Immediately says that Cuphead's ""flimsy"" parry move makes him lose battles*"
Cuphead,maybe you should just GIT GUD
Cuphead,"Most games, movies, and, paintings look worst every time you see them. Cuphead looks better every time you look at it. You see how pretty the watercolor backgrounds are and the minor twitches in characters' movements. It is truly a visual masterpiece."
Cuphead,id say 9/10
Cuphead,"im still confused on HOW they beat the game, their game journalists bad"
Cuphead,This game is a flawless masterpiece
Cuphead,"Anyone that played Cuphead knows the critiques are true. It’s a great game, but unnecessarily frustrating when you lose to the same boss 50 times in a row. The parry feature is very important in the game and it isn’t 100% accurate. The animation for the power ups in the game don’t give you any shield from the objects moving in the background which causes you to lose HP’s easily. There’s a fine line between fair and uncompromising. Cuphead is so uncompromising it causes rage-quitting."
Cuphead,3:22 verdict
Cuphead,"Parie is very easy, if you play well. Just keep practicing"
Cuphead,not as refreshingly original as call of duty
Cuphead,Just bought it on ps5
Cuphead,"2:23 that’s not the game’s fault, you are just awful at parrying, what even was that"
Cuphead,"I'm definitely going to play this game :-)
With my brother! Yes!! :-D"
Cuphead,Parry is too hard? try jumping when u actually hit the pink?
Cuphead,"Bullet hell” 
Sudden changes theme intensifies"
Cuphead,"I the game came with easy difficulty, I would rate it 10/10"
Cuphead,Same people who gave advanced warfare a 9
Cuphead,Game's an easy 9 or even a 10.
Cuphead,The game makes you feel like a cup
Cuphead,"Petition for cuphead to be in smash

v"
Cuphead,Bro i dont How cuphead won against hollow knight
Cuphead,Idk if I should buy the forest or cuphead
Cuphead,"0:05 This ""review"" is a joke"
Cuphead,Thats a masterpiece game
Cuphead,8.8?? Mate just gib it a 10 NOOB
Cuphead,Half of the video the reviewer being a crybaby because the game is hard.
Cuphead,2:23  lol
Cuphead,la rosa de guadalupe
Cuphead,tati westbrook
Cuphead,10/10 no question
Cuphead,“Tutorial is too hard”- (-0.2/10 IG)
Cuphead,How is parrying broken? That's something wrong with your controls.
Cuphead,These guys are probably just salty because they'rere bad at the game. An 8.8 like come on!
Cuphead,I literally see no flaws with this game other than dr kahls robot being a bit unfair
Cuphead,i enjoy hollow knight more tbh
Cuphead,it isn’t even “unfair” it’s just challenging.
Cuphead,Kind of reminds me of megamanx2
Cuphead,I did the Jump Dash Tutorial part on the first try
Cuphead,It has a little something for everyone
Cuphead,"They rated Fortnite higher...



Think I'm gonna be sick..."
Cuphead,"This reviewer is kinda a cry baby towards the end. Everything about the game is pretty fair. He was just a little salty, clearly."
Cuphead,"I love this game. My Only problem is the Murmaide level on expert. No not the difficulty. Its Because she dosen't allways spawn 3 parries and if You Wait For Them. You will then Run out of Time for a S rank Leaving it To luck wether you win or not. DId i say thats just phase 1? Just please may her allways 
spawn 3 Parries before phase 2."
Cuphead,"The parry mechanic is supposed to be TIMELY dealt with and NOT being spammed.
Cuphead would've gotten around 9.0 if IGN understood this"
Cuphead,"3 level types

Mausoleum: AM I A JOKE TO YOU?!!!"
Cuphead,Superb closing line to the review.
Cuphead,"Let me guess next you'll say: ""cuphead is the dark souls of platforming"""
Cuphead,I’m grateful this is on ps4. I hope the release it physically
Cuphead,This guy sounds like rage a lot in this game
Cuphead,I ate pizza while watching jack play cuphead
Cuphead,I wouldn't trust a guy who can't even parry a basic ghost
Cuphead,How the hell if fortshite rated higher than this?
Cuphead,8.8? Talk me through your decision here 😂 very specific! Why not 8.7 or 8.9? 🤣
Cuphead,"Who’s here, because it’s just  been released on the ps4?"
Cuphead,Xbox owners are punching the air right now. What’s next ? Halo 🥴😂
Cuphead,"Will never come to ps? Microsoft  lie with some exclusives, it was always a timed exclusives, they did the same with rise of the tomb raider."
Cuphead,This game is the reason I bought an Xbox One like 3 years ago
Cuphead,Can video game journalists ever use a descriptive word OTHER than “GORGEOUS”? I mean yeah this game is amazing looking but I feel like every game is GORGEOUS. I’m SO happy this is on ps4 now
Cuphead,Ps4 baby
Cuphead,Anyone here after this game is available on PS4?
Cuphead,The Game Is Coming To PS4 Very soon
Cuphead,*Yeahhhh COMING TO PS4 RIGHT NOW !!!* 😃
Cuphead,Wtf lol people throwing temper tantrums over an 8.8
Cuphead,11/10 I cheated with the skip boss button
Cuphead,Bosses are Cpt Claw like in difficulty...
Cuphead,When you lose you want to break your monitor or tv but when you win it’s the best feeling ever since I say a few extra things witch in my opinion is the best part about it
Cuphead,"Remember, everyone
They rated fortnite a 9.6 and cuphead an 8.8"
Cuphead,"You wanna know why it's so hard?





If it wasn't, the game would last about an hour or so.
So, would you rather have a hard game that looks gorgeous and plays hard, or a game that you could beat faster than a lego game?"
Cuphead,8.8 - This is to difficult for me
Cuphead,just because you worked hard doesn't mean you produce a quality product. Plenty of restaurants work hard and produce garbage food.
Cuphead,"10/10, Joe review is better"
Cuphead,An 8.8 for this amazing game shows how completely worthless IGN reviews truly are!!! This game destroys that glorified web browser platforming game that they gave a 10!!! Get it together IGN! You have lost all credibility!
Cuphead,What it changes the movements after to you die on the same battle ...oh no this is going to ruin me
Cuphead,cuphead would be a dope smash character
Cuphead,"I just beat the whole game of cuphead today! It only took me two years, lmao."
Cuphead,8.8/Not enough like COD
Cuphead,8.8 controls were not to my liking
Cuphead,Mark Brown Is that You?
Cuphead,10/10
Cuphead,"2:23 Lies he said this because he didn’t know how to do it. As you can see he try’s parrying but instead of pressing jump *once* he spams it,not leting him parry"
Cuphead,How does this game compare/contrast to hollow knight?
Cuphead,There are hidden coins and Easter eggs in this game
Cuphead,My honest trailer : https://youtu.be/wbCLXAEnwWU
Cuphead,Keep an eye out for our Cuphead DLC review when it goes live... soon...
Cuphead,I I downloaded full Cuphead game for free on my normal phone. 10/10. There is a few litlle issues in the game but it doesn't effect your gameplay at all. If this comment gets 100 likes i will give the link.
Cuphead,This game is worthy of being on a Avon because it’s hard but fun
Cuphead,Man the cuphead in nintendo is freaking impossible (kind of)
Cuphead,Best shooter on Switch! 10/10
Cuphead,Best game this century.
Cuphead,I bought the ps4 version because the switch version is shit.
Cuphead,Cup head is like a more cartoon style Contra. Lol
Cuphead,"This game is super difficult, yes. But it has endless retries. For someone who grew up playing Contra III in the SNES and had to start the game all over again after running out of Continues, this is nothing 😂"
Cuphead,It’s boring. I regret buying it
Cuphead,"Hi Felix, I have started this game today and all ready having a hard time haha. I’ve done 2 levels and I’ve lost a few times well more than a few haha. I’ll try!"
Cuphead,Beautiful game...but hard as the hell...
Cuphead,"If you don’t like long loading times on switch handheld mode, then no, like most cross platform games, the switch is the worst version of it, just get it on PC instead."
Cuphead,Arent you gonna say how CLUNKY the Controls on Switch are no matter how you change them ?
Cuphead,"Game was cool when i played awhile back,would definitely buy a physical copy if they ever decide to release them"
Cuphead,Remember wanting the game when it first came out but didn't have the money. Then just completely forgot about it. The dlc and the show brought it into mind again
Cuphead,Cuphead is amazing
Cuphead,Is it still free stupid question but I need to know
Cuphead,"I bought it on Switch long time ago. Too hard, but nice to own anyway because of the game design."
Cuphead,This video has convinced me to download it soon
Cuphead,This game brought me back into gaming after thinking everything was a first person murder simulator.
Cuphead,..contemplating if i'm gonna jump dive into this Cuphead thingy
Cuphead,"Man, i just wanted a physical copy release =/////"
Cuphead,"I've had this on my wishlist for a long time, I really need to get around to buying it sometime"
Cuphead,"I wonder what would count as a 10/10 for Nintendo Life, and what prevented Cuphead from getting it. I enjoy the reviews, but most of the time barely any flaws are mentioned, making me believe that especially a game like Cuphead (or Hollow Knight) would get a well-deserved max score. It's completely fine not to think it's a 10/10, but since there is no reasoning behind a 9/10 in the video, the scoring just feels arbitrary."
Cuphead,I’m loving this game so far and I wish that I didn’t wait so long to buy it!
Cuphead,It’s hard but not punishingly hard. It’s no ghost and goblins or ninja gaiden but is for sure harder than something like super mario bros.
Cuphead,"I don’t normally ask people to play it but please, dont miss out. This game is arguably the best indie game ive ever played"
Cuphead,"Yes x1000
There’s so much value in the game
Top 3 favourite game of all time"
Cuphead,It’s going to be difficult jumping back into this.😅 I never realized that there was a co-op mode.🤯
Cuphead,"I like everything about the game expect playing it. I love the art, characters, environment, music and even the cheesy story. However there is a lot of bullet hell gameplay and I hate bullet hells."
Cuphead,Can someone tell me - if I love Metroid dread will I like cuphead? The fighting style seems similar to me. I love the challenge and skill involved with Metroid and think cup head would be fun too
Cuphead,"I miss Alex, where is he 😔"
Cuphead,It's been three years....?? 😶
Cuphead,"I’ve been putting off getting it for ages because I don’t necessarily like hard games but it finally went on sale for 1399 and I decided it’s now or never. I’m on the 3rd island. All Bs up to the bee queen boss except for the clown on island 2 I have a C+ 
I absolutely love the game."
Cuphead,One day... I'll finish it. Three bosses a year 😅
Cuphead,Chris scullen mon the hoops
Cuphead,Bought my first copy of switch ! Really worth it. Works perfectly on it and plays great with joy cons. Highly recommend it
Cuphead,"I played it on the undocumented ""super easy"" mode called ""play something else""."
Cuphead,I wish I could play and enjoy this game and the dlc. Just throw me a bone here. I’ll continue to buy their games and dlc to support their beautiful hard work even if I can’t enjoy it.
Cuphead,"I'd argue it's one of the best games ever made I love Cuphead because its art style makes it so accessible to rope a friend into, but it is shockingly difficult."
Cuphead,The art style is amazing but this game is very hard
Cuphead,when is a goddamn physical coming out for this game
Cuphead,Thanks Felix for your personal thoughts.
Cuphead,Cuphead is a must have. A 10/10 imo.
Cuphead,"I just bought this game on a Steam sale and played for the first time yesterday. I was not expecting it to be so hard, even when playing with my brother, and we are veteran Metal Slug players."
Cuphead,Why the frick does Felix's voice in this video sound so good. It is smooth like butter.
Cuphead,"Swap the “is” and the “it” places, remove the interrogation mark, and you got your answer."
Cuphead,the physical version would just be empty case with download code inside 😂.
Cuphead,4:41 WOAH! How did you pull off that jump!?
Cuphead,If only the cartoon looked like this
Cuphead,😂
Cuphead,Whit the dlc out there asn't been a better time to try the game out
Cuphead,Most definitely it is. This the first game I’ve played of its kind (I’ve always found them boring) but this game is just so addicting. Difficult yes but fun. It takes me about 50 tries for each level but the satisfaction of beating a level. UNMATCHED
Cuphead,w
Cuphead,YES BUY IT AND SUFFER
Cuphead,I got Cuphead for the Nintendo Switch and Xbox Series X 😀
Cuphead,I love this game feel so nostalgic
Cuphead,I like but also find it weird how these older games are getting reviews
Cuphead,All right you made me buy it on sale on my Xbox Series S Now I did Play This Before AND I THOUGHT IT WAS HARD!!! But I'm willing to give it another go considering its Art Style and Beautiful Music! Now is the DLC WORTH IT?!
Cuphead,"Yes,that’s all I’m going to say"
Cuphead,I’m planning on getting it soon.
Cuphead,One Word: Yes!
Cuphead,i bought it day 1. i remember refreshing the eshop over and over again
Cuphead,Any suggestions on some wireless switch controllers? (Other then the original)
Cuphead,no
Cuphead,Yes it is worth it. I’ll be double dipping when the physical comes out
Cuphead,Thx man i really needed this suggestion kinda video
Cuphead,I love the Cuphead Switch title!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Cuphead,I always be sure to run to the toilet to do a dump when I see a review upload from Nintendo life.
Cuphead,Awesome video
Cuphead,Is it worth it? We like some rhetorical questions!
Cuphead,I bought it a half hour ago.🖖
Cuphead,first
Rocket League,Still play it daily with 13k games
Rocket League,whatching this cuz it was my first year of playing... :/
Rocket League,The camera shake is killing me this man can play it with it turned on how.
Rocket League,"The game improved, but the reviewer's camera settings didn't! 🤣"
Rocket League,Yes
Rocket League,Couldn't stop playing this..
Rocket League,They should make another review of Rocket League
Rocket League,Awesome game
Rocket League,"This game is awesome but we’ve never said a game is awesome before so 1/10 
- IGN"
Rocket League,“Formidable AI” xD
Rocket League,I just recently downloaded this game and I enjoy it.
Rocket League,Who watched this in 2020
Rocket League,0:52 0:54 how’d you get those cars?
Rocket League,Who's here after it's free on PS store?
Rocket League,Do another review once it's on PS5. I wanna see if you've improved
Rocket League,Who all are here after this game goes on free...😎
Rocket League,It is now free on Epic games
Rocket League,Its free to play now
Rocket League,"Rocket League is free on epic games.
Who is here for checking the game??"
Rocket League,Whos here when PlayStation YouTube channel announced rocket league is free to play
Rocket League,I wish they wouldn't have used such crappy gameplay for the video...
Rocket League,Here after it was announced to be free
Rocket League,I am playing rocket league since 2015 and 1;500 games have lags
Rocket League,I want to know what rank he is thinking bots are a formidable opponent if you can't play online xD
Rocket League,He just said rocket league has a low skill ceiling omg
Rocket League,when you get 30  fps in rocket league:
Rocket League,is anyone impressed that this game got higher rating than uncharted 4?
Rocket League,This game is filled with nothing but toxic players and with the new blueprint scheme its just a money pit worst game ever nothing gets added to the game permanently only temporarily. Its a waste of time and money
Rocket League,Y es una mierda
Rocket League,ROCKET LEAGUE ES PARA CALVOS
Rocket League,They used the same footage as they're last review🤪🤪
Rocket League,"So if I buy this on the Switch, will I be able to play my friends on PS4? Cheers"
Rocket League,"No...
It can't be...
Anything but.....



SCREEN SHAKE
*O Fortuna earrape plays*"
Rocket League,What IGN stands for?
Rocket League,"If I buy the switch version to play on the go and play the Xbox one version at home, does it keep my ranking?"
Rocket League,Is this an offline game or only online?
Rocket League,"Season 7 anounced ....

*AN IT LUK GUUUD !*

https://youtu.be/ZNo5zpnk6l0"
Rocket League,i absolutly love this game.
Rocket League,I just got it on Switch for £5 😀
Rocket League,There isn’t cross platform yet...
Rocket League,Switch got a big improvement update tho
Rocket League,Did... did they say a low skill ceiling? Have they watched pro gameplay?
Rocket League,thanks was defienietly helpful. might buy the game
Rocket League,"Hey, I’m happy you have made this review. But it has a “lie” in it. I play on pc and although you CAN play with players on console or switch it is still not possible to be in a lobby “fx playing with your friend on console while you play on pc” with console players.
The developers is promising to make that possible but not until early 2019."
Rocket League,0/10 not enough rockets
Rocket League,Wow these clips are brutal to watch.  Get gud
Rocket League,when you watch this a year later and you know how to do a ceiling shot
Rocket League,A damned masterpiece!
Rocket League,"Am I the only one who thinks they should add a racing mode, I mean a lot of people say it’s a bad idea Son they should it’s horrible but it really isn’t it would be fun"
Rocket League,10 / 10 hands down
Rocket League,this game is boring to me...
Rocket League,Can two players play locally on the same team?
Rocket League,"agree with literally everything, very well made video. The choice of words was wonderful"
Rocket League,Cant control the ball
Rocket League,Avaliable to everyone with Gamepass 😀
Rocket League,"8.0 to much ""what a save!"""
Rocket League,There is competitive for 4v4?
Rocket League,There isnt competitive in 4v4
Rocket League,Rocket League doesn't have a skill ceiling. It goes forever up!
Rocket League,"I love Rocket League. Me and my friends play tag in the split screen multiplayer mode, its fun."
Rocket League,"I’m not a football fan, but as soon as you add cars and what not; I’m immediately into it. 💯"
Rocket League,Is this worth getting on my switch if I have it on my PS4? I don’t use my PS4 much.
Rocket League,Has this game suddenly started to run like poo for anyone ? From around March 2018 and still no good in May.
Rocket League,Wish there was a PS Vita port
Rocket League,Meanwhile IGN rated fortnite 9.6
Rocket League,Is it worth getting this game if I don't have PS+? I'd be playing single player mostly and split screen sometimes.
Rocket League,Songs? Badass riffs hopefully there’s part of songs.
Rocket League,Am I the only one that thinks rocket league is overrated?
Rocket League,well guess I know what game im getting today.
Rocket League,The only people who should be allowed to review this game are the people who have mastered it ! I'd doubt anyone from IGN has
Rocket League,10 without a doubt
Rocket League,How does this get less than Fortnite
Rocket League,"Bit harsh on the switch version, i think it looks nice! Don't need 4k to enjoy this game"
Rocket League,Should I get Fast RMX or Rocket League?
Rocket League,This looks like an updated ripoff version of TWISTED METAL given an oversized ball.
Rocket League,His camera settings makes me triggered
Rocket League,Do people still play this game on ps4?like this and comment your gamertag if you do
Rocket League,The switch doesn’t look anywhere as good as it does here. Then again I primarily play it portably so...
Rocket League,"""The AI can even make offline matches intense"""
Rocket League,The only game of soccer I'm down with
Rocket League,The game is boring now no new  maps
Rocket League,"Trust me once you get good it's a 10, *but judging by your camera settings* I know for a fact you are not good"
Rocket League,There is no ranked 4v4
Rocket League,I might buy this game today
Rocket League,This looks fun I need this game
Rocket League,I was sold by “cross-platform compatibility”
Rocket League,"Does Anyone know if you can buy rocket league on actual disc ?? I searched it on google but it does not really tell you , so I’m thinking you probably can’t ... anyone know ??"
Rocket League,I got rocket league on the switch
Rocket League,I have the switch version....its awesome highly recommend it
Rocket League,Can you trade on the switch
Rocket League,Just give it a 10 lol.....
Rocket League,You never talked about how it is on steam
Rocket League,4v4 isnt a competitive playlist
Rocket League,"I love all the kiddos that get scammed...Its ur own fault, i mean, how can u fall for that trick...."
Rocket League,The legend says: And thus the camera shake is still on.
Rocket League,3 years later and you’re still bad
Rocket League,"All this game needs is loot boxes 




Said no one ever"
Rocket League,man rocket league is awesome!!!!
Rocket League,You are bad at this game.. therefore dislike
Rocket League,"u dont have the right to review this 11/10 game, since u r using ball shake.. u r destroying ur own experience, therefore its not a serious review.."
Rocket League,"Dunkey please do another rocket league video, and please turn off camera shake."
Rocket League,its crazy to see ikon still being used years later
Rocket League,The Mario Kart music is a nice touch 😂
Rocket League,The one game where his steering wheel remote actually helped
Rocket League,I love the ridge racer music you used
Rocket League,Aight but can we take a moment to appreciate the perfect timing of Leah being cute as a button? She's too sweet!
Rocket League,I’m glad Dunkey was able to get his team into IKON with him
Rocket League,Anyone knows the credits song at 4:35?
Rocket League,Hello. Can you please tell me what the outro music is? Please.
Rocket League,I can't believe sonic lied about his best selling game sonic and the seven shrimp
Rocket League,"This man fr swept the enemy team, switched teams and carried them to a tie, then switched back and beat them in overtime"
Rocket League,Boxo😊
Rocket League,1:35 masterpiece
Rocket League,1:28 Omgosh music from PS1 game RIDGE RACER TYPE 4
Rocket League,"All jokes aside, Dunkey is actually surprisingly good at Rocket League."
Rocket League,IKON
Rocket League,You still have cam shake on? Newb
Rocket League,Hey Dunkey my mom said I can sleep over on Friday and she even got me a bag of gummy bears to put in our oatmeal in the morning! So if your mom says it’s ok then I’ll bring my sleeping bag and my pillow and my gummy bears and my extra Nintendo 64 controller in case you don’t have two of them. I even have my own mini flashlight for at night time and it has a regular light and a red light and then the red light even flashes too! It’s gonna be awesome Dunkey BAAAYBEEEE!!!!
Rocket League,I like that dunkey still makes Gex' s jokes
Rocket League,dunkys ability to master any game is amazing
Rocket League,"As someone who plays this game almost daily, it’s great to see how good the competitive scene has gotten. Let’s get another championship 
I K O N!!"
Rocket League,IKON strikes again
Rocket League,"1:26 

We can see here how Dunkey truly is the best at the Rocket League of Legends, as he sent “Calculated” into the chat 7 times, possibly more. Dunkey truly is the first strand type rocket player"
Rocket League,Kinda feel bad for orange at the end
Rocket League,"Dunkey is so good that he scored 9 goals in regulation, and then finished the game in 2 minutes in OT"
Rocket League,mans too good he started kicking his own ass for a fair match
Rocket League,Dunkeys cam makes me claustrophobic
Rocket League,The ridge Racer music yeah
Rocket League,Dunk is surprisingly decent at a lot of games.
Rocket League,"0:01 only after 3 times rewatching, I realised it wasn't a failed goal on his end, but rather a save.
*3 TIMES*"
Rocket League,"I think you're all sleeping on. ""Hey guys my name's Sonic I made a game called Sonic and the Seven Shrimp check it out"""
Rocket League,ikon clan forever
Rocket League,whats the outro music
Rocket League,I rewatched this video two years later and realized that donkey scored every goal except one in the last game... holy fuck lmao. I wanna see him do that again. the rocket league meta was so much fun ngl.
Rocket League,more entertaining gameplay than pro players imo
Rocket League,2:11 so it was dunkey that invented the whole wall dashing thing that recently people started using
Rocket League,More sanic
Rocket League,his camera settings hurt me
Rocket League,Mega mongo goal
Rocket League,"Knowing dunkey I would have thought he is a what a save guy, Glad to see he is a sophisticated Calculated man."
Rocket League,I kinda wanna turn on camera shake now.
Rocket League,They had sound  film in 1933
Rocket League,3:25 The way he says Voila is my favorite
Rocket League,Thought i was the only one who likes to help the other team with multiple pity goal rally
Rocket League,0:56 why does he sound like Peter Griffin
Rocket League,1:57 - I'm an orange car.
Rocket League,My name wizowzkki lol
Rocket League,“All started back in 1933” when rocket league was $20
Rocket League,1:09 imagine that the car is your fingernail and the ball hit the tip of it
Rocket League,This one truly made my day. the last match was just insane. Thanks for bringing back good memories how much fun with friends I had with this game.
Rocket League,2:36
Rocket League,"Dunkey was thrown in a ranked 3 v 1 and every goal, including the opponent goals, was his."
Rocket League,What’s the outtro song name?
Rocket League,Ikon BABEE
Rocket League,Okay so when rl sideswipe
Rocket League,nolonger in ikon huh
Rocket League,This is where Kanye got the idea for orange tesla
Rocket League,I want you to post anything rocket league  but only the stuggle like when it’s being annoying
Rocket League,"Heard the IKON clan is recruiting, can I join?"
Rocket League,I just now realized this is the Mario Kart 8 soundtrack
Rocket League,"According to the Urban Dictionary, Sonic and the Seven Shrimp is an action-adventure game written and developed by Sonic the Hedgehog. The game was a hit in Mongolia and sold 17 copies. You can buy the game for The Vectrex, the Atari Lynx, and the Philips CD-i."
Rocket League,"“Dunkey should use the, Ecto 1 in Rocket League.”"
Rocket League,omg ridge racer type 4 music!!
Rocket League,"0:56
Now I know why this video doesn't have captions"
Rocket League,Scoring all 11 goals for both teams in 3v3 is the real power move
Rocket League,2020 AAAAAAA
Rocket League,So this is where Orange Tesla got its inspiration
Rocket League,Ridge Racer Type 4 OST FTW though
Rocket League,Ikon
Rocket League,YOOO he is actually pretty good at rl
Rocket League,really makes you feel like sonic the hedgehog
Rocket League,Hey Bunkley! When are the next IKON tryouts? I have been following your group for a while now and would love to become your student.
Rocket League,I can’t hear a goal without “IKON SCORES IT AGAIN BABY!!!!”
Rocket League,Its crazy this video is how I discovered rocket league and made me want to play. Free-to-play dropped and now I'm a champ.
Rocket League,"Random guy : ""yeah fuck you, you ....(inaudible).""
Me : ""your name is 2GIRL1Cj... Why are you even talking"""
Rocket League,so how exactly did Sonic the Hedgehog get into this situation?
Rocket League,Still waiting on Rocket League 2021
Rocket League,"*goals*

""OH MAH GAWD"""
Rocket League,The worst part of this video is when he's playing the Mario kart 8 music and it cuts off right before the saxophone goes off and fucks you up.
Rocket League,"Pretty impresive play, as expected from the guy who used to hold the record from Bowser's Big Bean Burrito."
Rocket League,"It's crazy how dunkey scored 5 goals for each team, considering he had no teammates, the blindfold, and the USB steering wheel."
Rocket League,Seeing everyone with IKON in their name  just slayed me.
Rocket League,I am better at this game then you
Rocket League,"""My names sonic, I'm an orange car now"" is an underrated line"
Rocket League,Is this the guy who held the world record on Bowsers big bean burrito?
Rocket League,nice shot! i have covid
Rocket League,new pulse member?
Rocket League,"Oh, Sonic and the Seven Shrimp is real"
Rocket League,Holy shitamole 🤣
Rocket League,"The question isn’t why Sonic is an orange car now, it’s why is he on orange team every game."
Rocket League,Happy 1 year anniversary to this video
Rocket League,Crazy this was a year ago
Rocket League,you remind me of kosta from the movie project x xD
Rocket League,"my friends: Bro whats the best Rocket league player. its definetly squishy
Me:hahahaha nice joke its dunkey
my friends:who is that
Me:THE BEST IKON CLAN MEMBER IN THE WHOLE ENTIRE GALAXY"
Rocket League,"You’d think they’d at least make Sonic one of the _blue_ cars, I swear Sonic Team are beyond incompetent"
Rocket League,0:39 I don’t know why but as a Canadian I found this extremely hilarious.
Rocket League,"how do you have such good car control?

-asks me, someone who thought a laptop with intel integrated graphics was the ultimate rocket league setup because i used the alt key instead of the ctrl key"
Rocket League,That’s another goal for Ikon baby
Rocket League,"""Nice shot! I have covid""

~ IHAVE COVID A.K.A Gex"
Rocket League,Who came up with a game where you play soccer with cars?
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Sayori died and when i open the game she is just a bunch of video pixels what is going on i am feared
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"Even the game warns you but if your sensitive to certain topics, stay away from this game."
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,I hope they are under 18
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"My final thoughts on this game are not good, to say the least. ""Doki Doki Literature Club"" is one of those things that should've never seen the light of day, much less gain the popularity it did. The story is disturbing, the gameplay is weird (not the good kind of weird), and the characters feel like they're glorifying their mental disabilities. Unless if you are one of those people who have a weird imagination, I highly recommend that you avoid this one at all costs. My final rating of this game is as follows:
The Story: 1/5 
The Gameplay: 1/5 
The Characters: 2/5
Overall: 1/5🗑"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Just finished a full playthrough and this game had me in tears multiple times. It truly is traumatizing in the best way where it sticks with you but nothing that will be harmful.
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"I don't get it. Seriously looks like the worst game ever, lol."
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"To me this is literally the same thing as the original with all the soul socked out of it. Heres the thing, DDLC was an experience like none other. Navigating your own hard drive and moving files around in order to progress made you feel like you truly take part in some sort of weird fourth wall breaking situation. It made you think that Monika truly was on your PC trying to contact you through this visual novel and the whole experience was very immersive and almost real. Enter DDLC+ and all this has been completely removed and replaced with a generic in game OS that completely destroys the immersion. Orignal was an experience, Plus was a game. Original was a piece of art, Plus was a product made to make money."
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"DDLC is a masterpiece. I hope Dan makes a new game sometime. That man is an absolute genius. I played the original DDLC release, but even though I haven't played Plus I still bought it Day 1 on Steam to support the developer."
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,I thought it was dating game is horror game
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"Weird, by the way people talk about this I thought it was a game all about nudity. Lol"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Haven't played yet but I doubt this game would beat Fatal Frame or Siren in terms of horror.
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,why are you Australian? I actually need to know.
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"Oh u reminded me I wanted to buy this game ;) but I don't want digital version :P and it's a lot of games I want to play, but it's always like, ok I'll buy this and that, and... oh ok it's for another time XD definitely I should play, thx"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Im not  a gamer who love horror games but i played fnaf 1 and cry of fear this 2 games are  scarier for me but for some reason i have a fear like the game will send a Killer to kill me
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Remember this game is not meant for kids
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"I’ve never played this game and I’m probably never going to- I’m a complete scaredy cat when it comes to horror. Guess I’ll just always be left wondering, ‘Why is it creepy?’. I really want to know, lol. But I know I can’t."
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,I played it on my switch it was not scary or anything I didn’t sleep bad
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"I like manga anime and horror, but all I can see here is anime dating and stuf. So where's the horror?"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"Yeah, the girls ""became friends"" 😏."
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Is this a hentai game?
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Amazing platnium trophy for the ps4. Totally recommend for those into visual novels and anime
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"Honestly, i dont understand why i read so many people love this game. I just played through it and i am so disappointed after all this good backlash. I thought it was so boring to read all through the bubbles. And i really didn't think it was that scary. The whole glitch-moments were annoying and if you are used to horror , jumpscares like this arent just it. Also writing horror on mental health based themes ... Idk? As i have mental health issues myself, the shown was sad yet not so shocking (seriously 20% of the people have depression at least once in their life. it's everyday life for some of us. Stop being shocked that something like this exists!)  and the graphics of suicide ... Very disturbing i must admit but i found it more sad than creepy (yet it was super predictable that the story goes this way). 
this content can be highly triggering but the Triggerwarning is shown after you purchased the game (playstation store). Thats so annoying (i would want my money back just because of this) 
I really regret buying this game and i dont recommend it. You can probably get a better story game at the app store."
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"I played this game at 3 am when it first came out and daaamn it was creepy, a really unique experience"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Way too weebie
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"This Review Is Absolutely Right About How I Felt During The Whole Game After Act 1 Started To Get Dark! But I Didn't Like The fact that, They had no V.A. No Movement."
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"I would enjoy this 10 thousand times more if it was voiced. I’m not sure what the thought process of the developers were here, but it bums me out."
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,The biggest horror of DDLC is realising one of the characters is the girl of your dreams and living with the fact they will never be real
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,I don't mind watching them death
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"I feel like, while the horror elements are the hook, the characters at the heart of the horror are what bring people back. That's why it was so genius to make the side stories for DDLC+, because it expands upon the characters and makes us care about them even more, making what was previously scary just sad in hindsight. I love stories that you can unpack in different ways on multiple playthroughs like DDLC+ - on one hand you could see it as a deep psychological horror about the dangers of artificial intelligence gaining awareness, but on the other you could see it as the tragedy of a broken girl who thinks the only way to find someone who will truly care about her is to hurt the support group she already had. Brilliant"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,what's the difference between this and the version released on pc for free in 2017?
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,I just preordered this game too ha
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Right fine 😒
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"I feel like one of the truest terrors of DDLC isnt even the deaths and jumps cares every now and then- its the lack of control for me personally u have no controll of the game or what you do even your choices make no change and you are so inferior all you can do is escape and close the game but there is no way to properly change the game -you can delete monica but shes still there u can delete everyone but the game will just end you have no choices the happy ending where these girls become ur actually gf( which ik some of u neckbeard incells want) it's just impossible you cant completely rewire the game.....
















Or can you?"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"I saw gameplays of the game on youtube, so I knew what was going to happen, but that didnt stop me from enjoying it, I loved this game for its psicological horror, it didn't bothered me a lot the disturbing scenes, and I enjoy finding the secrets that I never saw in youtube, and I dont care if the side stories aren't that scary, I think the point of this version is the lore behind it. So in conclusion, I never regretted buying it."
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,You never even said what makes it actually scary
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,[SPOLIER ALERT] Man I have played and watched plenty of horror games but this one had to have been one of the most disturbing. The Sayori scene made me throw up. The game was so cute( I had never seen anything on this game other then the warnings in the beginning so I knew it was something) and just the running and build up to opening the door and when I saw it and the creepy music I couldn’t hold it I ran to the toilet to throw up. Caught me so off guard. Psychological horror I believe this is. Bravo to the developers
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"Here’s your review.

I spent $15 bucks just to feel even more depressed.




Money well spent."
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,I pre-ordered the physical copy all exited but I’m really scared to play it when it comes. I feel like it’s gonna truly mess with me. Ima be scared for the rest of my life 😃
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"I discovered original game in december 2020, when I clicked on video from my favorite youtuber with title (i try to translate it) ""How I survived Doki-Doki""
It sounded Japanese, so i thought that it will be review od some kind of hentai like Bocu no Pico. 
He is very pragmatic, so when I heard first words ""Holy Mother..."" i was surprised. 
Then he started talking and.. it chatched me. I paused, when he said, that in the next part of video will be spoilers. 
So, I found, that the game is for free, downloaded it and start playing. I was surprised, because it was so sweet that i was wondering, if I do not watch the whole vide... and then ""I gently open the door"" scene came... 
But, this game is amazing and that hiden lore gives this game a brand new dimension
P.S. I'm sorry for my english :D"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,So when does the horror actually begin?
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,GAAAHHHH I WANT DOKI DOKI LITERATURE CLUB PLUS SO BAD
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"I recommend checking out ""Pony Island"" for those who enjoyed DDLC. That game is only on Steam, and is similarly priced as DDLC+. That game fuvking freaked me tf out that one sequence, it's crazy 🥴"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,I was 12 when I beat it. I swear to God how close I was to suicide..
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Better than summer time saga tho?😂🤤😅😅
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"I just played it for the first time and I won't get into great detail, as I made a video myself actually talking about it in more detail but I thought it was a great game and a new experience, even if it is pressing the same button the whole time"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"This is a really well-made review, thanks!"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"Its not cheap jump scare scary, it's actual psychological horror, a complete masterpiece of a game"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Can a person with anxiety and depression play this game?
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Why. Does. This. Channel. Only. Has. 1k. Subs.
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"I definitely agree with this review, this game is something that everyone who's remotely interested in horror should play. *Or if you're more mischievous, you can recommend the game to them without mentioning that part.~*

Ultimately, this game is a love letter to the fans just like me who fell in love with the orignal game.  Featuring a bunch of extra unlockables meant to cater to completionists, and some heartwarming sidestories, that, while they don't fit into the horror genre AT ALL, are what I consider to be a good change of pace considering the tone of the original game. Overall, I had no issues with how they were handled. Apart from the fact that I wish they were longer!

The lack of changes to the base game was something I found quite disappointing. Sure it has some polish improvements and some higher res CGs, but the changes aren't gonna blow your mind by any means. I still had fun revisiting the base game though, I'll give it that.

The new songs are also REALLY good, and I really enjoyed them. I can appreciate the fact that they went through and created them, instead of just recycling old songs like I expected.

The overall story is also something that I really think will throw people for a loop. The whole ""Metaverse"" thing with the VMs was a really clever way to handle the weird discrepancies that were somewhat questionable about the original game, and I'm excited to see where Team Salvato will take it in future games.

Overall, while it didn't blow my mind like the original game, I can safely say this is the definitive version of DDLC. If you're a fan of the original game, this is something I can easily recommend.

9/10 *IMO*"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,i just need to know if I can get a happy ending with Sayori 😢
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,I'm so confused
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,£10 away I hope I piss my pants this midnight
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,I really want to play it but I'm scared of horror games :(
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"I will say for the horror side of this wonderful game, I still have moments where I have to look away (scene with the rope). It still gets me like ""HO.... yep there it is again..."""
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Is it worth playing if I already played the original a few years ago?
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"Ngl, when I played the first game I can't sleep properly there's times I just suddenly wake up yet I finished it. It was worth it"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Monika is the one for me.
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,100th like 😊🎉
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,I played through all of DDLC and got all endings possible… is it worth playing the + version ? Since I already went through the whole game.
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,How old do you  reckon you should be to play this game
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,I kinda saw this as a disappointment..
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"i wanna know if you played the old one, if  this one is worth it, are there new routes or everything is the same only with new little things"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"Short answer:  YES!!...........................
...........................................................
...........................................................
...........................................................
.......... *If you wanna get traumatized.*"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,So is there any new scares in this version or is it all the same
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,How does the fourth wall break work here? I’m curious how that works on the switch.
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Is there anything scary in this one or is it giggles and fun
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Finally doki doki+ she's here : )
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Nice really nice
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,nice review
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"KINDA EARLY


this is amazing"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Is it horror
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Thanks for the minimal spoilers! An amazing review!
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"Have you guys experienced this game before? Or first time playing?

Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"A great addition to console, but pretty hard to play with one hand. 😔"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"I was really happy when this came out, after being a fan since it came out on steam. I got it for my switch. I think it’s really cute and a cool upgrade but it’s a little weird to navigate. Overall, i’m very pleased. I need to finish it already hahaa"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"[spoiler]




I don't agree with people about 1 thing when it comes to doki doki. Doki doki is a great psychological horror game if not the best, but its not because jumpscares, the unsettling images or even the file thing(I agree that was scary but its not the most scary part of the game). The scariest part of ddlc is also the reason why this game is not for every type of person. To me, the most scary part is when the game gives you a very long time to know club members in general and know someone really close with writing poems. By doing that you are more attached to characters in time. But when things start to go wrong and you can obv see it, there is nothing you can do because your character doesn't see and you can't do anything about it. The more things going worse, the more you feel something is not right. Whenever you think you are closer to the right thing, the more you get pulled away by that. And after all the time you wrote poems while forgot this is a horror game, you now have literally no control over anything and the game keeps going without giving you a chance to react and think what is happening. So many things go on. Files, deaths, dark poems, nonsense poems, secret poems, file things, girls changing like all this happens in a very short amount of time compared to the time you got close to them. Its like you can't even breathe because you have to understand what is going on. And even if you somehow make a good decision/have a good idea to do, your character almost doesn't even have the capability to talk anymore, its only you watching after some time. But when you are only watching, the fourth wall breaks are even more efficient and effective. Its like magic. Showing you some little hints, blows your mind up with the events happen after and after which makes you to not be able to follow up what is going on, when you can finally understand what is going on you just start to get ignored by the game and it just becomes a script after sometime instead of an interactive game, and because its something you can only watch now,  they can use a trick that is gonna work much better now."
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,I think I’m the og game they were flat because it was trying to give the feel that it was a romantic dating game
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"I don’t like the built in monitor setup, I think the best fourth wall break from the original, was monika slowly putting things in your files without you knowing, here it’s obvious because, why else would there be a monitor in game?"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"I'm sorry but I fell in love with ddlc since it first came out, one year I went to one of my local comic cons and a lady was selling ddlc Head pillows and just had to get one of natsuki and the next one is coming up in a few more months and hope she's there again."
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"Nice to have a game that fleshes out the characters more, the only really deep character in the original was Sayori, and the other characters are really interesting, they just needed more fleshing out."
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,It's just the best. I never played it but just watched yt videos on it. My favourite is the purple hair girl
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,mannn I was looking forward for the horror aspect :(
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,So glad at the end it was candy hearts and not candy heartz. Anyone with me?
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,I never play the game before do I have to play the first one?
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,:-D
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,part of it is undoubtedly giving something back to dan salvato and his team . i am going to buy it when i have the money bc i 100% believe that $15 (i think thats the about price) is a good price for the original and i ADORE this game and im so undeniably in love - and we got this FOR FREE . $15 is not a lot
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"I expected a lot of new psychological horror content from DDLC plus. I like the new additions and stories and all, but I was disappointed when there wasn't any new horror. I remember playing the game for the first time back in highschool and it messed me up big time"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,This makes me want to get this game but I will not buy this game because one day I was thinking about getting a new horror game and i saw this game and with how I am I was reading the description of the game to if I was good out of nowhere my playstation froze and crashed so it gave me a feeling like if I bought it something horrible would happen to me.
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,The DDLC theme with FNAF play through in the background is like a wild fever dream.
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,An inspring game.
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,ddlc plus is so cute n this was a great vid!! gonna check out your other vid on ddlc soon <3
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"I finished Sayori & Monika's sidestory, and gosh, that was SO cute.

Feel free to bash me but ehrm, _they would make a cute couple_
But uh, moving on, seeing the girls really spending time together, no personality-less self-insert MC, no terror or suffering, and just being friends... That's just so lovely! I'd call it priceless, but this has a price tag on it, so at least we know what their friendship is worth, and apparently, it may vary depending on where you live."
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,my personal and petty problem was that this new soundtracl doesnt slap nearly as hard as the original-
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,I would just buy the plus to support the developers to support their future projects
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Yes my family my right I pay money for this s***game 😒
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"DDLC is becomming popular again, because ddlc got a crossover with fnf"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,When I saw this game first announced. I thought this was going to be a smash clone lol
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Biggest question who’s you’re favourite character?
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"I’m a huge fan of ddlc and I love the characters but my big gripe with plus is why pay $15 usd for a game that may aswell just be a mod. There’s some really amazing mods out there I’ve played, some that even made me cry (ddlc blue) but is it really worth paying the $15 extra to experience this?"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,When I first played ddlc+ I just sat there clicking bc I wanted to unlock the side stories and I didn't know about the desktop feature in ddlc+ which really threw me off
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"I believe that it's worth it if you wish to support the creator(s). I only _very_ recently got into it and I absolutely love it. Completely understand if somebody doesn't want to buy Plus when they generally get the full experience in the free version. Although I personally can say that I bought both Plus and the soundtrack for the game because I _really_ wanted to buy it to support Dan and it's my way of thanking him for this amazing game. That and the soundtrack is actually really amazing, it surprised me just how much I love the soundtrack. Even some songs that people would view negatively due to story aspects I love, like Sayo-nara and even Just Monika. That's off-topic though. Plus has really good side stories and a CG collection that is really nice to go back and see the scenes in the game as well as some behind-the-scenes artwork. Even some fanart makes its way in there! Those are generally the things you get over the base game which isn't much but hey, it was a free game and still is.

TL;DR I love this game and if you do too try to consider supporting the creators as there's lots to love with this game."
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,cool
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,oooooooooooh well then im just gonna proceed to say that simp
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"you should make a discord server, it’s great for growing ur fan base and community. love your videos!"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,They nerfed monika sadly...
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Just Monika.
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,To me ddlc plus is worth it just for the side stories
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"Great video! I’ve played DDLC+ on both steam and switch, and it’s absolutely worth it imo. Like, each side story spoke to me and helped me get closer to each character that I loved, and it was so great to see them get closer to each other, as well. Worth every penny!"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Novo inscrito do brasil
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"I’m biased to the game and characters so I was happy with what we got. But, I would’ve preferred DDLC 2."
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,this was definitely an odd game to remake like this
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"Here's something that ddlc had that ddlc plus doesn't have, mod support. Like ddlc plus is sweet and I love the story, but the original's ability to have mod support is always special as you can read some genuinely heartaching stories made by a group of passionate fans."
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"If you care about the characters of DDLC then sure, get Plus.

But if you mainly focus on the horror aspects maybe not."
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Haven't seen new side stories. Are they something similar to ddlc rain clouds (the mod) ?
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,such an underrated channel
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"Ddlc is perfect, ddlc+ is a cashgrab"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,You make great content! I hope your channel grows! Keep it up! :)
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"I would love to get into DDLC, it seems to be an amazing horror, but dang, the lack of voice acting kills my small, dyslexic brain."
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,I love your doki dokis videos
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,I was thinking about if I wanted to get this game when you uploaded this video
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Wiener balls
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"Oh hey, I’m on time"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,we need a doki doki and fanf game for this guy come guys love youre vids
Sifu,"so it's basically one of those """"git gud"" games"
Sifu,👌🌟🌟
Sifu,"Jet Li ""Rise to honor"" Still fun"
Sifu,"lol ""poig-nant"""
Sifu,"is that 9:43 the ""Oldboy"" Hammer Scene Hallway ? at least thats what it reminds me of"
Sifu,It’s like DS meets the warriors
Sifu,you did not have to spoil the oldboy corridor man :(
Sifu,"Did this MF say ""poiG-nant""? Lmaooo"
Sifu,10:20
Sifu,looks great like urban reign
Sifu,"imagine if they added randomized levels, endless mode and open source for mods, this would be permanent classic"
Sifu,Shenmue?
Sifu,That Old Boy corridor hehe
Sifu,Bought this game yesterday.  Want my money back.
Sifu,Ads video
Sifu,Kinda reminds me of that Jet Li game on ps2... Rise to Honor? That game was wild
Sifu,great review! Game looks awesome!
Sifu,Wish this was on steam.. Dang epic store
Sifu,The combat gives me Dead or Alive 2 vibes
Sifu,Hope its long like swich yakuz
Sifu,"Old boy included a sequence inspired by beat them up games, and now beat them up games include sequences from old boy.  The circle is complete"
Sifu,I've come for the Absolver feels
Sifu,the actual room audio has me dead...laughing
Sifu,"Best combat game, this game is crazy :)"
Sifu,Great news !! It is gonna be on the switch !! 🤤
Sifu,"too short for a purchase, outside of a deep discount ($10usd or less)"
Sifu,Top 10 of best games ever made
Sifu,The hand-to-hand combat in this game feels so nice and powerful. Keeps me coming back.
Sifu,Never buy this game on the console. The PC version with mods that let you play as Chun Li or other famous fighting game characters is badass as hell.
Sifu,Just bought this as its on sale can't wait 🙌
Sifu,"Just say ""poignant"" for us one more time..."
Sifu,Anyone else think this guy sounds like discount Wiz from death battle?
Sifu,Absolver had rhe best melee combat system that ive ever seen or expereinced. Like people need to try it
Sifu,Is it worth getting this game in 2022? Graphics look a bit crappy
Sifu,This game is extremely difficult
Sifu,This game makes you feel like Jackie Chan!
Sifu,What the name of the game
Sifu,4:00
Sifu,Sifu rhymes with review
Sifu,Easy mode 😬
Sifu,19.99 yes…59.99 is a solid nope🤣
Sifu,Double Dragon type looking game🤔🤔🤔🤙🏽🤙🏽
Sifu,This reminds me of Urban Reign oldschool combat game.
Sifu,One of the best fighting games I've played. Just brought it and enjoying the journey.
Sifu,All the combat animations look horrible and the action looks utterly fake.  They should have hired someone knowledgeable in Chinese martial arts before work began on this game.
Sifu,"""THE DARK SOULS OF BATMAN GAMES"""
Sifu,"That is not how you pronounce ""poignant"" lol"
Sifu,"It reminds me of shenmue , looks like worth a try eh"
Sifu,Who’s back now that they are adding difficulty settings 😅
Sifu,"This game felt like sekiro but with hand to hand combat, it's it's own thing but it just strangely remind me of sekiro satisfying combat"
Sifu,Great review...very indepth!  This was like reading the manual but more fun :)  Do people even read manuals anymore though...lol.  Great job on your video :)
Sifu,Sleeping dogs reincarnated
Sifu,"This game is awesome, the gameplay, visuals soundtrack, everything is just perfect, one of my favorite games of the year, no question.

Just imagine a streets of rage reboot with this style... One can dream."
Sifu,I'm glad he didn't say Dark Souls.
Sifu,Haha typical of ign to like it.  A new game with Ps2 graphics for a fcking ps5.  No thanks.  Pull your finger out game developers. This is pathetic!!
Sifu,"One of the rare times where the game review score truly matches the game's quality. Mitchell Saltzmann is definitely one the best reviewers in IGN and this review is yet another showcase of that. 

As someone who's sunk in nearly 100 hours into Sifu at this point, Mitchell's review seems to be the best one that really understands the game's vision and what it really is."
Sifu,"Crap game, boring and repeatative, not worth my money."
Sifu,Who is this presenter reviewer...he is excellent.
Sifu,👆👆👆le nom ci-dessus est très pertinent si vous avez besoin d'aide ?
Sifu,👆👆👆le nom ci-dessus est très pertinent si vous avez besoin d'aide ?
Sifu,Why does this game remind me of “Kill Bill” ?
Sifu,yip
Sifu,IGN has been goated w the reviews recently
Sifu,How can you heal in Sifu?
Sifu,So disappointing this isn't on Switch
Sifu,Challenging  yet rewarding
Sifu,"that's not how you pronounce ""poignant,"" fyi"
Sifu,Shenmue remake.
Sifu,The only 2 things wrong with the game is the camera angle sometimes screwing you and that it's not longer it's a 9/10
Sifu,Ain't a 9/10
Sifu,Modern streets of rage
Sifu,no way this is the same rating as marvels spider man and miles morales
Sifu,I'm not impressed by these animations at all. I'm not following the narrative. Combat looks outdated
Sifu,"oho... there is parry mechanism like sekiro.

end the video, go directly to epic store"
Sifu,I'm against beating chics who wear flip-flops
Sifu,Still need to get the plat!
Sifu,Quite a few decent reviews from IGN recently
Sifu,unless its my controller its  garbage game with the npcs always getting the upper hand.
Sifu,Such a pity this doesn't seem to come out on XBOX... :-/
Sifu,"Again, one of the very very few genuine IGN reviewers."
Sifu,"Damn, great review. It's nice to see when reviewers take time to make a longer video analyzing the game in more detail."
Sifu,I’ve never enjoyed fighting games but this looks really exciting.
Sifu,some of the moves on joystick are kinda wonky though
Sifu,So it's a reskinned Absolver?  Got it.
Sifu,The real life trailer got me to buy the game it was so dope
Sifu,Seafood 😂
Sifu,Disney should hire Slocap to make a Shangchi video game.
Sifu,This game looks pretty entertaining.  3D beat ‘em ups are rare.
Sifu,Hopefully this comes to Xbox maybe….hopefully
Sifu,literally abslover
Sifu,So finally the dream of The Bouncer became reality?
Sifu,They missed a huge opportunity to make this game even greater....the bosses should also increase in age and experience as you do also
Sifu,"That Oldboy hall way homage, though..."
Sifu,"""it has a little something for everyone"""
Sifu,We need more game like this.
Sifu,It’s definitely a challenge game
Sifu,"""DAMNIT"" been there"
Sifu,Boring
Sifu,"""9/10 it has a little something for everyone"""
Sifu,Wow
Sifu,awesome game alert
Sifu,Is this like sleeping dogs
Sifu,Bought this game on 3 different platforms just to support this studio. It's a masterpiece.
Sifu,This gives me sleeping dogs vibes
Sifu,Souls player: Youre locked in here with me
Sifu,You thought repeating the same level over and over again just to be better at completing it would be boring... But BOY you coudn't be more wrong
Sifu,And Xbox. You do any research?
Sifu,Reminds me of the Bourne identity game for 360 back in the day.
Sifu,I bought this game because I loved and played Absolver.
Sifu,"This game is so goddamn good. Never played a game so damn challenging but kept me wanting to try again, over and over and over again. It is so rewarding to get better at the dodging, learning the new skills as you go and permanently unlock them. And just getting better and better at it."
Sifu,Is it good for mouse and keyboard? or obviously a controller game
Sifu,"One of my favourite games ever! Don't know how I managed to finish it, because I was getting my ASS WHUPPED, but it was so satisfying to finally finish it, even though the first ending kinda sucked because I didn't realise I had to spare all the bosses to get the good ending! Arena Mode is awesome too!"
Sifu,"Check out jet li rise to honour only on ps, you flicked the right analog stick to attack and it just do random punches and kicks and if there was an item to use nearby it would"
Sifu,reminds me of sleeping dogs
Sifu,Not saying this matter but can I make my Character Black? 😳
Sifu,Best game I’ve purchased in the past 10 plus years too bad it’s short
Sifu,"What would be a more interesting idea for a game is like Sifu with the aging, but the wipeout of the gang stretches over several decades. It would be longer and more linear, and as the game progresses, you would get older and older, and become more and more renowned and infamous. Dying would just speed up aging."
Sifu,"The difficulty is similar to Elden ring or Dark souls 
The suffering only makes the victory so much more satisfying. And you feel like a badass"
Sifu,It's finally on Steam 🥳
Sifu,4:00🤣🤣
Sifu,"This game is the closest thing the Switch has to actually being Bruce Lee in a game and that's why I bought it last week. The only complaint I have well 2 actually is there's no nunchuks like WTF?! Also the ""dlc"" is really weak and imo too expensive for what little it offers but other than those 2 things I love it so far."
Sifu,Sekiro: catch these hands edition
Sifu,I downloaded this yesterday and I’m at the tower playing the easy difficulty and I’m at age 42 in the game getting my ass kicked an still love this game this game is definitely not going to be for everyone but my god is it fun
Sifu,"Can we have these devs create the new ""True Crime Streets of LA"" game!!!!"
Sifu,Imagine this fighting system as an option in gta6 so we could do more than shoot
Sifu,did they fix the camera?
Sifu,Very fun
Sifu,jackie chan PS1 memories
Sifu,What gaming stores is it in? because I can't get it on steam.
Sifu,past time for the Godhand remaster
Sifu,Shang-Chi gone watched John Wick and went crazy
Sifu,"“Grinding to absolute perfection”
Sounds like playing Sekiro"
Sifu,Watching this makes me want a new Matrix game like Path of Neo so much more
Sifu,Reminds me of GodHand
Sifu,I’m just now downloading this.
Sifu,"Thanks for this BYB! I am now drooling in anticipation for this to download. I wasn't sure but this video was marvelous. This IS my sort of game. A perfectionist gamer who likes skill based games and fighting when outnumbered on a ""level"" balance. I've done MMA since I was 7 starting with Wah-Lum Kung-Fu. Super excited to dive into this game."
Sifu,Fantastic game so far. Got my ass handed to me by the botanist A LOT. Sort of reminds me of sleeping dogs crossed with Streets of Rage
Sifu,"I love this game so far! Saw it for $30 on PSN and this was a great buy. It reminds me of Rise of Honor with Jet Li on PS2, but the combat here is waaaay better lol"
Sifu,"Did you ever play Bushido Blade? Somewhat similar to the aging mechanic, you'd get wounded in a fight and lose mobility or striking power as a fight went on."
Sifu,Video game kung fu hasn’t looked this fun since sleeping dogs
Sifu,This game reminds me of Sleeping Dogs too much. Only exception is the aging mechanics.
Sifu,Can't wait for this game to come to steam to try it out
Sifu,I played the game on Nintendo switch for five hours 😂. I just got to beat the main boss now.
Sifu,"Can't quite believe this got released on switch. Insanely hard, but using the environment and weapons is key. I'm still getting to grips with it, but it's a lot of fun.

It does make me wish for a port of godhand. That game was amazing."
Sifu,Jet Li: Rise to Honor is a similar type of mechanic and I loved that one. It would be great to know the opinion of someone who has played both
Sifu,Now I gotta get it.
Sifu,"Thanks, this looks like a really interesting game. From the description it reminded me of Katana Zero a bit."
Sifu,by the looks alone it looks like a far more advanced jet li game from back in the day
Sifu,Is it like sekiro?
Sifu,"This game is a rare gem, but so far, I always croak around the age of 80 when fighting the gardener in the Slums, that is, after he cheats with his sword."
Sifu,It's just like Bruce Lee in The Way of the Dragon. Love it!
Sifu,Like Hades?
Sifu,is it for MacBook Air?
Sifu,Woman beater game
Sifu,I will try to beat this game with minimal deaths though I'll aim for no deaths. Wml as a first timer
Sifu,I just got this game and is awesome! Remind me of gods hand 🤔
Sifu,Def one of my fav games this year! About to redownload!
Sifu,Feels like the good old arcade days playing Spike out.
Sifu,I love that game! Had it on my radar but now I finished it I have no regrets!
Sifu,"Elden ring,God of war,Sifu,evil west"
Sifu,Thanks for ruining the intro.
Sifu,Looks like a Kung Fu version of The Warriors for the ps2
Sifu,If you get a game over at age 70 do you lose ALL game progress ?
Sifu,"When I heard you talking about the feeling of playing the same levels over and over again, I thought of the game ""My friend pedro""."
Sifu,Is this free roam?
Sifu,I've been wanting to try this game but haven't gotten round to buying it yet it looks amazing
Sifu,"So this was just announced for Switch, I'm pretty excited!"
Sifu,Reminds me of Rise of Honor for PS2. That jet LI kung Fu video game. Looks pretty good.
Sifu,This game really reminds me of jade empire in a way
Sifu,I feel like it needs a better story
Sifu,Sifu is the type of game that will beat you up and tell you that you are garbage at everything even aging.
Sifu,DO NOT BUY unless you like unreasonable frustration for not a huge payoff
Sifu,Imagine a John Wick game like this.
Sifu,Same as midnight fight express
Sifu,this game gave me STD's
Sifu,"I always end up watching these before you buys at least three times: on release, when I’ve saved enough to buy the game to get hyped, and when I finally get the game to have a sort of intro."
Sifu,Am I the only one that sucks at the game the combos are confusing as hell
Sifu,A cool part of the game is when you walk into a new area and the npcs start talking to you and then the game prompts you to respond. You can ignore all of that and just punch them in the face.
Sifu,First game I've loved with a burning passion since sekiro came out.
Sifu,Vaguely reminds me of Jackie Chan Stuntmaster PS1 game
Sifu,Have you ever played the game Absolver?
Sifu,great game !
Sifu,SEAFOOD IS THE BEST GAME EVER
Sifu,Yup
Sifu,Lol this looks amazing yo 🙏🏾🙏🏾💚💚
Sifu,Something like this.... maybe yakuza ?
Sifu,"This game looks amazing I'm definitely going to get it once I finish my current game. Just the age mechanic and challenge looks so unique and fun I can't wait to play it. I Love A challenge, I don't understand why so many people get mad when games are actually challenging, that's what makes them actually rewarding and fun to play imo"
Sifu,"Came up in the Epic store, first place I looked was here to see if I'd like it. Definitely sounds like Afro Samurai gameplay. Will be buying soon."
Sifu,You have convinced me to try
Sifu,on pc is it possible to play this on kbm or is it controller only?
Sifu,bruh the game has the same name as my dog
Sifu,I just want more outfits
Sifu,the amount of times ive rage quit this game is immeasurable
Sifu,"Man, I wish its open world games like sleeping dogs 😎"
Sifu,"Ok don’t get me wrong the game concept, art style and animation is great! But the control is just not that clear or responsive! The block and parry is just so hard because many attacks happens in milliseconds and each one requires deferent buttons combination! The fight on level 1 against the guy in long grass feld (or whatever it really was) I lost 6 years. The most important thing of the game feels not that good. I wish they made blocking all attacks with one button or at the most L1 high attack and L2 low attacks, but they didn’t. That’s why I loved Ghost of Tsushima and platinum it because the control is so f*cking responsive with no extra not necessary complications."
Sifu,999803 views
Sifu,idk why this reminded me of jackie chan for ps1
Sifu,they need to make a online
Sifu,"Just waiting for ps4 disk version at july28, so I hope the combat skills can be update just like  pc players that what they did to the  mods…"
Sifu,"sold my xbox x and given my ps5 to my kid im not paying 70 dollars for games anymore i will just download them for free on pc lmao 
 or wait for a steam sell"
Bastion,is this lol
Bastion,The story is amazing. It is simple but beautiful and your choice at the end is very meaningful.
Bastion,The reviewer sounds familiar.... Meg Biller?
Bastion,Hades lovers will love it
Bastion,is this better than hades?
Bastion,"Finally played this game. Even 9 years later it holds up. Art direction, gameplay, story are top tier. Timeless game. Supergiant really created something special."
Bastion,"How can they say the story is weak?
But hey its Ign, what did we expect🤦‍♂️"
Bastion,Did ign bring anyone else here?
Bastion,"Someday I will make a movie trilogy about this game, you’ll see"
Bastion,Bastion.. Transistor.. Pyre..and Hades.. supergiant is gigantic .. wat an incredible gaming library ..
Bastion,This game makes you FEEL like the kid
Bastion,"Weak story? How...
The story of bastion is one of the best there is!
Not to mention he didn't mention the amazing soundtrack the studio has tailored the gaming level to..."
Bastion,"Damn, that narrador nevers shuts up. Just talks and talks and talks.  I feel the game a little Boring too. I prefer playing cat quest.  (Talkink about the switch)"
Bastion,It's about time I owned this. Just got this and Transistor for around 5 bucks on eShop sale.
Bastion,I guess they forgot about Who Knows Where?
Bastion,"Just picked this up on Switch for $3! Never played it, but have heard great things. Very excited to play it tonight."
Bastion,"got it for £2 on ehsop, I'm happy ...."
Bastion,The story is just kind of there???
Bastion,finally i found this game after 9 years
Bastion,hooly crap that intro animation is old
Bastion,Bastion IS it’s story
Bastion,Very Fun Game.
Bastion,"'Weak story' shows just about how much of the game youve played. Dont get me wrong, im not hating or saying that the story was a revolution in gaming. Of course there are better indie titles with better plotlines than bastion, like hollow knight. HOWEVER. calling the deep intricate painting that which is bastions storyline is doing it injustice, and i heavily object. Also, WEAK STORY MATE?
Keep in mind the damn game is an indie title. It was mindblowing how much they made me care about the characters and the plot. Bastion remains one of my favourite games"
Bastion,"WEAK STORY?
Still better story than Tekken"
Bastion,Yea... it's a 9.0 but weak story? WTF! The story was its strong point along with the soundtrack. Is the reviewer a little kid lol?
Bastion,"Beautiful game, but I agree, story needs more development to make care for the characters."
Bastion,"""It's like a super onion!"" ~IGN 2011"
Bastion,w e a k s t o r y
Bastion,aaa Blizzard nerf this game
Bastion,Looking pretty cheap on sale.
Bastion,$4.49 on PSN right now. 👊🏼
Bastion,"I love the poster for this game,it's like an innocent little kid being thrown into chaos.I only wish they would have used a kid's voice actor.I hope there will be a sequel one day or turn it into a Netflix series plz."
Bastion,"i finished the whole game in one sitting, was very proud. i didn't really go through the dream scenes but i did finish one without any idols revoked lmao. still a pretty good game and has some sort of replay value to it (mostly for achievements)"
Bastion,"this game is crap, i dont get why everyone likes it, the story makes no sense and gameplay is mediocore."
Bastion,In this world Bastion isn't a war machine but instead a boy that has powers
Bastion,KINDA
Bastion,"3.75 CDN on PSN now,
Is it just me, or does the narrator sound like Drebin from MGS4?
I looked up the voice actors and they're not the same person"
Bastion,superonion 😂😂😂
Bastion,Who agrees that this is the best game evet
Bastion,The story is like the best part of the game together with the music.. what..
Bastion,the story for this game is beautiful! wtf are you on???? when I first got this game I couldn't put it down due to all the different modes and things to collect. I haven't played it in about three years since and fogot some bits but on replaying it you can't help but be totally drawn into the story. it's not spoon fed to you and you don't have to go looking for it either. it's teaching you the lore and take of the game as you play it and you come out of it just knowing the world you're surrounded by and the history of it more so than you might know earth's.
Bastion,Weak story? Are you kidding me? Maybe if you guys stop getting a hard on for a grown mans voice and actually follow the story. Maybe you can see that the story is touching and amazing.
Bastion,"Weak Story, 9/10 IGN."
Bastion,"Weak story? How? The characters and world are amazing, just because they didn't serve every little plot point on a silver platter doesn't make it bad - quite the opposite in fact"
Bastion,$1.52 on g2a..
Bastion,"I'm a simple guy, I hear Greg Miller's Voice, I dislike."
Bastion,3 bucks on the Vita!!!
Bastion,Can you buy this on Xbox One marketplace?
Bastion,the story is amazing
Bastion,the story was perfect wtf are you talking about
Bastion,how did they not mention the amazing soundtrack?
Bastion,0.0 2nd review in a row with a man calling that narrator sexy
Bastion,Just bought for $3sumthing... Will be playing it soon... IM GOD 
Bastion,"Does anyone know if this will be cross buy with the PS Vita? If so, this will be an amazing game on the Vita system. I heard it will be cross buy, but when?? "
Bastion,is less than $4 on PS4 right now!
Bastion,Weak story
Bastion,Stupid I ign the story is awesome you guys suck I bet everyone disagrees with you on the story party this game should be a 10
Bastion,"in all fairness.....the story is a bit weak. however, that doesn't take away from the fact that this has to be one of the greatest indie arcade, downloadable titles of all time."
Bastion,One of the best games I've ever had the chance to play. Please just buy it
Bastion,"""The story is just kind of there""

Bitch please. "
Bastion,Bastion is like a Super Onion. Done.
Bastion,It is only here at IGN that has a VERY HIGH standard for the story.
Bastion,"The only problem I really had with the story is the way the ending choices were handled, making the player feel like their decisions really didn't matter much. Guild Wars 2 did something similar, but it was more a matter of ""which plot line interests you more?"" rather than ""the plot lines are so similar you barely notice the difference, so it doesn't matter either way""."
Bastion,"the guy explicitly mentioned that ""at the first few hours"" the story seems kinda meh with a few touching moments, BUT when you go on, then it becomes more deep and a rather huge or bigger weapon options are available and also the plot thickens. when he mentioned ""weak story"" in the end, it was just to give the game some negative since it is almost nonsensical to give a game a 10/10. it was given a 9.0 which is a pretty darn good review so i think this review was pretty good , maybe just change the way of saying ""weak story"" with something more appropriate would be nice."
Bastion,"is the story really weak? I think that opinion was randomly brought out. Can someone tell me if the story is good, because I like games with beautiful plot lines and am thinking of buying this game."
Bastion,story is weak?!!
Bastion,"I don't usually support IGN for one reason or the other, but this time they did a good job. People, he gave PRAISE to the story telling, he criticised the OVERALL plot, and yes while the narration is hellishly mesmerising sometimes it's too vague to help u get the story. So yes the plot is kinda weak ( it does have some symbolism to it though, in a way similar to braid)"
Bastion,WEAK STORY!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
Bastion,Weak story... OBJECTION!!!
Bastion,"This game got a better review than COD ghosts and yet people are STILL bitching.
Unless their favorite game gets a perfect score they complain.
Stop watching these reviews you little shits."
Bastion,"I watched 10 reviews today, 9 had a negative that was about the story.... 
JUDGE GAMEPLAY FFS like in your older reviews like mario galaxy"
Bastion,"""Weak Story""
The literal fuck."
Bastion,You're a couple years too late to be getting mad about a review 
Bastion,"I am amazed that the negative is the story. The story may be one of its strongest points had they not absolutely nailed graphics, music, and narration."
Bastion,"not a good story? WTF
"
Bastion,"Weak story? Yeah, sure..."
Bastion,they should make a rap as to how awesome Humble Bundle is...
Bastion,"Well, as a teenager, I kind of take offense to that. Having played Bastion, the story really is much better than the reviews make it out to be. I've played Cod:4 and all the ""story-intensive"" ones, but they really don't compare to the story of this game. I agree with the score they give it, but not the REASON they gave it. ( I would give it a 9.2 at least though)"
Bastion,great use of >
Bastion,"You guys are getting really annoying. ""WHAT?? IGN THINKS THIS ONE THING ABOUT A GAME IS BAD? OH, BUT IF IT WERE CALL OF DUTY, IT WOULD HAVE GOT A PERFECT REVIEW!!"". Look, in all seriousness, you need to grow up. I don't mean to assume that you are a child that lives with his parents and doesn't do anything but sit around all day and eat cereal, I am pretty sure you are a teen or a young adult at least. But when you post comments like that, it really makes me think you are a child. "
Bastion,"He sounds nothing like Morgan Freeman.
Get out."
Bastion,Are you seriously saying Morgan Freeman narrating your life in Bastion isn't > then COD?
Bastion,"me
"
Bastion,Anyone else here because of humble bundle?
Bastion,LMAO @ super onion.
Bastion,about 6 hrs
Bastion,how long is this game?
Bastion,true
Bastion,"Look IGN, I don't have any problem with you guys giving low score on the game that I like or give some generic shooter high score and all praise. Its your review after all. But are you just now sayin bastion didn't have a good story?? no ... this is where I drew the fucking line and you just fucking cross it!"
Bastion,in a review of cod. not on this one
Bastion,"... You honestly have no idea what you are talking about, do you? Have you ever played either game? Have you played any game? And Bastion has a basic story? Have you ever even looked at the game?
What the hell are you talking about?"
Bastion,On both controller and keyboard they are some of the best I've played with. They are perfect.
Bastion,When did he say that CoD had a good story?
Bastion,IGN.
Bastion,Who said anything avout cod?
Bastion,He forgot about the awesome soundtrack
Bastion,"Not at all, you're just a typical fucking idiot that has nothing better to do than follow mainstream hate towards a game."
Bastion,"oh, sorry i hurt your feelings?"
Bastion,We should burn him in hell
Bastion,"Couldn't you tell from my comment that I don't, you goddamned moron?"
Bastion,Hi guys - with the upcoming Transistor releasing shortly on Switch and not having completed this one on mobile. We had to get Jace to cover this as he is a BIG fan! Hope you guys enjoy the review! (Mark)
Bastion,I don't recall the screen shake being so bad wow.
Bastion,omg I just spent 30 minutes playing the beginning of this game and didn't have the volume on... guess I'm starting again.
Bastion,"You say the plot isn't original, but this game came out 11 years ago and you say you've played quite a few games in the past few years with similar plots, wouldn't this game BE the original since it was made BEFORE the other games you've played recently?"
Bastion,If it had pvp and more hereos this game would be in my top 10 action rpgs
Bastion,"It's $3.50 aud right now, deku deals is great for checking the e shop"
Bastion,The visuals and soundtrack are awesome. But it’s WAY too easy lol. I blew right through it. It has challenges that give it replay value though so I may go at it again one day.
Bastion,Which to get this pr transitor I got this on iOS when it came out for 3$it's on sale for today now idk if I should grab this 1 or transitor cuz I know I'll enjoy this never played the other as I never beat this either cuz my iPhone died the week I got it smh that piss me off lol byt I'm on the fence with which 1 between those 2
Bastion,good review combat reminds me of hades which i love. It's currently $3 on the switch e store
Bastion,just got both transistor and bastion for 7usd only.  18/06/2021
Bastion,"Its on salr again right now, definitely getting it"
Bastion,"I played this on some system around its launch (maybe steam?) For 30 Min or so and HATED the platforms assembling under/near you mechanic and felt like it was a substitute for a proper fleshed out environment. 

It keeps getting great reviews though, can someone tell me if I was wrong and this floating island thing isn't crucial to the whole game ?"
Bastion,Got this and Transistor for $4 and I'm blown away. So much content for the price!! The soundtrack in Transistor is incredible
Bastion,I purchased it for 80% off.  Fingers crossed.
Bastion,Just got this for USD3 today!!
Bastion,"Absolutely loved this one (Played for the first time on switch). I wish someone would narrate my life the way it does for the character in the game. Narrator at one point would just say ""Another day, another poor decision, when will this guy learn?""."
Bastion,"Just picked this up for 4 bux, lovely title. That narration is tops"
Bastion,Just picked this up for 2 bucks lol good stuff
Bastion,This or Transistor?
Bastion,17/20 is 18/20
Bastion,"Thank You Mark for the great review! Bought it 2 minutes ago for €2,50 so almost for free👌🏼"
Bastion,viewing this because its on sale
Bastion,This is currently on sale on nintendo eshop for 3$
Bastion,Just got this and transistor for like $6. My Switch back catalogue is ridicilous 😩
Bastion,"Saw this game on sale for 2.99 on the eshop. Imma buy this. One thing I know this game for is that it was built using Monogame (derived from XNA) which is one of the pioneer frameworks for cross platform game development. As a developer myself who tried coding with it, I'll say it's unlike other engine since you code everything because there is no GUI tooling. A team of 7 epic people. 🙌"
Bastion,"Great review. It was 20 bucks when I first saw the review, so I waited and grabbed it for 4 bucks on a sale. I love seeing these indie devs hit a homerun and make a massively successful game."
Bastion,"Bought this, the art looks beautiful"
Bastion,"On sale (huge) on the Switch eshop right now until end of August 2020, I think. Pick it up if you want this game and haven’t got it already."
Bastion,"THiS is why I like the Switch: see a game on sale, buy it with a ""why not"" mentality for a few euro, get mind blown. Great review."
Bastion,got it today for 80 cents with gold points
Bastion,Might be me but the video seems to break at 2:29? Half of the screen goes distorted and cant watch the rest of it. Know the game's good just wanted to see another one's view on it heh
Bastion,Does anyone know if the orange canister exists in the switch version?
Bastion,"Definitely a classic! Get in now, while it's on sale👍"
Bastion,"I bought Bastion on IOS, Android and PC. If I had a Switch, would buy it for the console as well."
Bastion,"Call it bas-ti-un one more time.. it is abvious that you never touched that gem, you are just reading a script."
Bastion,Wasn’t this made by one of the folks formerly working for Gamespot?
Bastion,"Why buy again ? I never bought it before, you assume a lot. Wrong title for me. Review is ok"
Bastion,I'm thinking of getting this game. Thanks for the review.
Bastion,it's on sale for 2.99 right now.. good review
Bastion,"I love how these cheap 90% reviewers never question the design of a game. Just because it's smooth and does what it promises, doesn't make it FUN. This is not a fun game design and definitely not 90%."
Bastion,Says audio scored 17/20 yet shows 18/20 🤣
Bastion,"Why are you saying Zed L?, its ZL"
Bastion,"Thought it was pronounced bash-tin, but I have no idea"
Bastion,"I was gifted this game on Steam a long time ago. I bought it for Switch for like $2.99 because the game is currently on sale, as well as others. I used my gold coins and got the game for free. The game is amazing on the Switch with no issues whatsoever."
Bastion,"I'd got this game on sale for $2 (I'd had some saved up coins around $1.20) happy to have this boy downloaded to my Nintendo switch today ^_^ kinda mad that I'd missed out on buying transistor, but oh well."
Bastion,Just got this for £0 using my Nintendo gold points. It had already been reduced!well chuffed
Bastion,I hit ultimate OCD on Elm Street when he read 18/20 as 17/20 for audio
Bastion,Just got it for 3 dollars.  Thank you eshop sales.
Bastion,Now £2.19 with 80% off from the eshop sale!
Bastion,"Haych-dee 
LOLOLOLOLOL"
Bastion,thanks for the review   so much better than my quickies   and im getting the game
Bastion,"Currently £2.19 on Switch UK. I've paid 28p along with my gold coins. Played about ten minutes so far, feel like I'm in for a very cheap absolute treat."
Bastion,I refuse to buy this without a physical release.  Digital games are a SCAM
Bastion,7:25 Wait what... 17 out of 20? I don't get it...
Bastion,Get bastion and transitor right now if you don't have it. 80% off on both. Its a must buy.
Bastion,"There is a awesome sale for this right now for only $2.99 and transistor for $3.99 . 80% off both, If you haven't purchased yet this will be the perfect time. 8/21/19"
Bastion,One of my favorite games ever. Still listening to the soundtrack.
Bastion,Looks fun
Bastion,"Remember buying this on xbox but never finished it, picked it up again on the switch and I have to say what an incredible indie game, from the haunting western soundtrack right down to the art design! Loved every minute of it. Just like I love the switch what a fucking console it is 😊 when in doubt get it on the switch . Funny thing is I'm a console gamer bur these days all I play is the switch.  Can anything stop this little 720p screen"
Bastion,Seventeen = 18 :0
Bastion,Yes
Bastion,I've never played this. Is it worth it? Should I buy this or transistor?
Bastion,"I remember getting this game on sale for PC, I paid less than $10 for it back in 2012 and it was fantastic. The combat is fun and engaging, the narration is terrific, the art style is endearing and timeless, the difficulty is highly adjustable using idols. I strongly recommend it to anyone who hasn't already played it, though I personally wouldn't spend $15 on a game that was released in 2011, full price is too high."
Bastion,"Playing this game now on the Switch and i am loving it. The narrator for the game is the true winner, haha."
Bastion,Huh did I miss the Crash review ?
Bastion,Is this game short? Any replay value worth doing?
Bastion,Buy this or wait for diablo on switch?
Bastion,You guys are reaching 10k subscribers
Bastion,Okay okay! Shut up and take my money!
Bastion,Double dip great review guys. @Switchup @Mark @Glen can I mod for you guys. I mod for JKB
Bastion,"Since I didn't finish it on the Vita I have to give this gem another shot! Thanks for the awesome review! 😀 👍
How is the screen space on the switch in handheld mode? I use my switch in handheld mode 99% of the time."
Bastion,I was on the fence buying this game. Guess I have to get it now
Bastion,Had this on my PS3 not a fan of the isometric view but the constant narration and engaging story kept me playing
Bastion,"beautiful game. i will definitely be getting this. it is on sale on steam so i will check it out that way. if i love, which im sure i will, i will most likely get me a switch copy to take on the road. so good. great review, Jace"
Bastion,Jace nice review and mark nice voice
Bastion,Never got to play this one. Might have to check it out when my backlog is a bit lower. Awesome review Jace!
Bastion,"On an unrelated note...I beat the Lich in bullet hell last night after 200 hours of gameplay!!!!

Thank you clone, your the best."
Bastion,"Sound rating was stated as 17, but the video showed 18.  Minor editing mistake."
Bastion,"This is the first time I hear about this game, looks fun, definitely a buy. Great review"
Bastion,"Great vid, I got this on  the 13th and took me about 5 hours to beat. It started out very interesting to me, but I cannot believe the great reviews this indie has got. I really thought this whole time it was a more open world game, but it can't get anymore linear! By the end I had no idea what or why I was picking my choices and they happen so fast back to back to each other I cannot see how whatever you choice creates a worth while impact; also the choices happen sooo late into the game that it is over pretty much after the choices so once again they don't matter. Way to short and doesn't keep the steam up from beginning to end. There is NOTHING special to this game other than narrator and the world appearing while walking to me. Rather disappointed w/ this one in the end"
Bastion,"Looking forward to this, I had it on PC, but didn't finish it"
Bastion,Great review. Mark Definitely worth buying again one of bast indie  I add it from the first day thay put in e shop
Bastion,"Played this game on Xbox360 not sure I need to go through the same game again maybe on an offer, you going to review Dust an Elysian tale?"
Bastion,😱.. I haven’t played this game years.. NICE! Great Review Jace 😉 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
Bastion,"Thanks Jace, keep up the good work mate"
Bastion,Such a great game. Perhaps Transistor will follow at later date.
Bastion,I played this game back in the day and the narration really stood out to me. I loved it but I found the story not all that memorable. Gameplay was pretty fun though. Nice review Jace!
Bastion,Love this review
Bastion,"great review 
for me this is a classic. up there with the best and one of the games i would associate with the indie revival we see now. 
boy does it look smooth on switch 😀"
Bastion,Tempting since I've never finished it on the iPhone.
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,4:38 ah poor bean:D
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Hi
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,this game should be 10/10
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,This reminds me of sonic and glover 64
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Worst game ever. Impossible to win. 0 out of 10.
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Looks like Mario Party 64
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Please release fall guys in mobile 😭😭🙏🙏🙏😭😭

Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,That was lame
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,The part when ha said “As you’re bombarded with monstrously overgrown oranges” is my favorite part lol
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"Lol, so much hype over this game, I see why it died. Every time this happens the game fails to meet expectations."
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,looks like takeshi castle in real life......
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Can confirm. Losing the final round will make you more upset than anything like never before
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,.
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"Pros: its fun for a few days

Cons:
-it gets repetitive quickly
-theres so many bugs and glitches
-they lie about fixing said bugs and glitches
-they never fix the bugs and glitches
-the team games rely more on random luck than working with your team
-they have an achievment where you're suppose to get 5 wins in a horrible, glitch filled, rng based game."
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,What a crazy game
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,This is the most fustrating game I've played.
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,What y’all smoking on
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,who else is here after the game is dead.
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Still better than among us
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,This reminds me of Team Buddies minus the guns and crate building! Sony needs to remake that game!
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,how is this game not 2 player
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Vitiman😂
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,I can’t wait til this comes to switch lmao
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,That glizzy at the end hit me.
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Garbage
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,What Nintendo needs to say: “shut up and take my money!”
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,They need to remove team modes cause this game would be so much better if it didn't rely on you're team
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Fall guys is just another cash grab at the battle royal genre
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,this game hype died
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"You give very call of duty that is just a reskin every year a 9, but an interesting new concept made well gets an 8?"
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,My girlfriend whose not a gamer freaking stayed up all night trying to beat this game. She has not yet made it pass the 1st round.
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,This is like those Mario Party mini games but battle royale style
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,*full* guys
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"Like, is it the same without have playstationplus? Cause it says it’s required for multiplayer but I don’t own PlayStation plus so I don’t know if I should buy it."
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,just hate the cheaters already exist now..
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Hackers in every fking game I play already quit
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,adding a stage where you race other people would be a great idea
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,My online friend just gifted me the game excited to play it!!
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,I'm staying out of it just how it looks
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,I won against a hacker in fall guys plz watch my video
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,why does this feel like 'takeshis castle'

Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"Rainbow - The Game
Me: ...not gonna lie, I actually like that."
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"""battle royale"" what?"
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Maybe if i was in high school i would’ve found this fun
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,believe me. china will make a ripoff of this game into mobile. lmao
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"Fall guys for the switch, fall guys  for the switch"
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,This game is so fun
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"If you enjoy this, search for ""Jelle marble run"" on YouTube. It's a real version of this"
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,I'd give this game a 9 but i do agree with most of your points
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,they gave fall guys a lower score than fortnite
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"The mechanics are based on fusterclucking, glitching, and falling hence the name fall guys.. Not a game to be taken seriously, just ment dumb fun."
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,No local multiplayer!? Wtf!
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,This game is the reason why I re-subscribed to ps plus.
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,This game is so fun. Why? Cause everyone falls.
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,4:46 feels like he’s writing a paper and really needs to reach the word limit.
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Lol. I wouldn't call this a battle royale game. It's inspired more by mario party than fortnite or pubg.
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,that games makes you FEEL like jelly bean
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,This is a better Battle Royale than Fortnite
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,This looks like a free 2 play game
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Ironic how seriously I take this game compared to the absurdity that is called the year 2020.
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"I like the team battles, but would prefer it to be a different mode. just have the winners of team battles get 1 crown each and solo wins should get like 3 crowns"
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Since when did Party Games become battle Royale games? The Wipeout video game and TV show were Battle Royales?
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,My cousin was playing this and it was really fun... If only this is for free 😅
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,if this game had local Co op up to four players with 56 other AIs (for the people who don't have great internet or internet at all) then this game would be perfect imo
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,i rage so hard in this game
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Better put this on mobile
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"I think Fall Guys is the only game I get angry at, surprisingly."
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"Getting screwed in the last round game when it's some lame game as the foxhunt is terrible, but I do really like the racing/platform skill aspect to it."
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,The most fun competitiveness there is hands down !!! Only game were takin a L is more funny that frustrating 😅😂 probably gonna be playing this for a min..
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,It looks fun
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Making this game free for this month was the best thing playstation could've done. Millions upon millions play this game now. It never gets old and over time then can create free updates with new obstacle courses.
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"The problems is when someone 5 meters away from me (magically) steals my tail, and I am literraly inside of someone, but I CANNOT grab the tail."
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Are we gonna talk about how he went the wrong way on see-saw
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,I hate this game with every fiber in my body
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"I think I would die of frustration just from looking at this. Nothing for me, tho i can see where people like this."
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Haven't played it but it looks kinda lame.
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Should have just let a bot read the text. This guy is horrible.

Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,This is the best fun battle royal game ever👌👌👌
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,I think 8 is too low. They did an amazing job and it's a br game that is actually fun and not full of angry sweaty gamers.
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"You're nitpicking and biased, I win. bye bye"
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,To bad I don't have any friends...lol
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Love this game
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Reminds me of takeshis castle
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,The only bad thing about this game is the hackers man
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"The game looks very vibrant and cheery, but I have a few problems:
1: Lack of support; The game is only on PS4 and PC, limiting players to only 2 platforms
2: As other people in the comment section said, the game might become stale in a month."
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Can I play offline?
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"Wait, it's a different looking Minecraft Mini Game server"
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,The problem is we wanted a br with party game mechanics but instead we got a party game with br mechanics.

Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,wowowowowowowowowowow
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,honestly i dont know if this game is worth the 20 dollars. it looks like it would be fun for about an hour or two but i wouldnt play it without friends. i dont think it is worth 20 dollars for such a shallow game.
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"""and the distance required to latch on and steal a tail being so small""

Not for everyone I'm pitted against apparently."
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"My brother has this game & I do really enjoy it, but it frustrates the hell out of me sometimes, especially the seesaw game... jeez, don't get me started."
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,2:59 i am tired let me take a Break
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"Only a 7/10? I’m surprised. The critique about losing because few teammates is a bit empty, it’s valid for any team game, like Quake, COD, Rocket League etc. No mention about couch coop so I still don’t know if I can play with my partner"
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Can u put it on switch
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"I've never had any game make me rage out like this 1!  It started out hilariously good fun but soon turned into full on anger either at jumps not registering, team mates not acting as a team etc.  I would recommend you play it but I wouldn't buy it personally!"
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"Hi if the small reason you see this i want you to know, your content makes me really happy and hundreds of thousands feel the same, and one of the reasons I want to become a youtuber, even if Im small my biggest goal is to make people smile like you i know you're really busy but it'd mean the world to me if you could give me your opinion on what I should work on :) ty if you cant I understand! keep up the great work"
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,This game is just too good 😂😂🤩🤩
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"11/10
amazing"
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"I often see reviewers and comments about everything being luck based in Fall Guys. For all the people who are interested in this game, don't be discouraged by this statement. It's often said by people who play games casually and not truly try to get better at it. Three out of five games I win, alot depends on whether I get the minigames Door Dash or Conveyor Belt.  These are the minigames that are truly only about luck. Let me explain why these two are luck based and the rest not.

Door Dash is a game where you have to choose the correct door, or you just let someone else choose it so you follow the one who chose correctly. However, if the minigame decided to put 2 doors on the other side, you're screwed because of the funnel that keeps you from going through the 2 doors next to each other. (Yes, this happens quite often)
Conveyor belt on the other hand (that minigame that throws fruit at you, I forgot the name) you also have literally no say on what to do. 70 percent of the players still run in the middle of the belt like a chicken without a head. Slowly people start to understand, they should walk at the side, where they can be protected by obstacles. If you're in one of those games where most understand, you're screwed. That's because at the very beginning it's all about luck whether you drop on someone or someone drops on you, without this headstart you simply lose because other had the luck of it not to happen.

The rest of the minigames, even teamgames, you can have a massive impact by yourself. You just need to learn how to adapt to what the team needs or use the space you got to keep/get the tail. (Don't stupidly follow someone with a tail and say it's a stupid minigame)

My personal rating for this game is an 8. If they'd remove the conveyor belt, door dash and release more often new minigames while also removing the current minor bugs and connection issues, it would be a solid 10. If you're still wondering whether you should play Fall Guys, just do it. It's funny to fail and it's funny to watch others fail."
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,People giving low scores and accepting it coz they are frustrated by their mistakes in game.. Don't blame your bad playing on the game.. It's so good and must be welcome to stay for years against all these stupid battle royale shit
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"1,000th Like!"
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,This isn’t a battle royals why do people call it that
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Plz put it on Xbox I want to play it
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"Can anyone get me fall guys, i'm too poor to buy it, DM me on twitter @tour0420 to help"
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Love it! Its like Fun Race 3D done right for the consoles and PC with the right amount of ingredients. Great work by Mediatonic !
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"Looks like it'd be fun to play for a little bit, but I'd get bored of it fast. And for $20? No thanks."
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Currently has an 80 on meta which means this game by 1 developer is better then every developer under Microsoft not making Halo Gears or Forza 😂
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,this game is so fun
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"100% my opinion too. The team games are unbalanced almost all the time. And the tail games are just unplayable. I'm really good at cutting off players but i 99% of the time i hug the guy from behind instead off taking his tail, allowing the player behind me to take his tail and run off. In ca. 100 played tail finals it happend every round so far. Definitly needs a rework. Oh i noticed this was a pretty negative comment. Besides those glaring issues its an awesome game. First Battle Royale i really enjoy."
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Royal fumble isn’t unfair. Use the orange ramps and the spinner to cut them off. It’s really easy
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Imagine if this was on mobile this would be good
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,This game has potential
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"Is this worth $20? Like, I wanna get it and do a couple videos on my channel of it, but it just does not look like a game that will have longevity for $20."
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,You can tell what a stuttery mess 30fps is on some versions of this game and others at 60fps+ on others.
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,I like the game but I don't know how other players are running faster than me.
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,I like the games like tail tag and royal fumble because it forces players to cut off the person with the tail and outmaneuver them. This makes you think outside the box to close the distance.
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,I hope they make this game on Xbox cause I have an Xbox but not a ps4 and I am broke lol
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Fall guys reminds me of a battle royale version of warioware
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"I love the game, but it gets stale FAST. Not enough maps available at launch. Hope new levels are released soon 😩"
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Reminds me of the tv show MXC... definitely going to give it a go!
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,*_I WAS IN THAT RACE AND LOST😂😂_*
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Am I the only one who’s waiting for it to be on Nintendo switch
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Pen Pen Trilcelon battle royale
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"wtf, this is not battle royale because by this definition racing are also battle royale"
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,DESERVES  10 .
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,2:57 wth? are there controller inputs to stay down?
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"I have like 3 thoughts/ideas of what should be added and idk if anyone agrees with me.

1. Custom Games with a max of 30 - 60 people so you can play customs with friends
2. I named this one - Make Your Episode! - basically like people would be able to make their own obstacle courses like in mario maker. Ofc you wouldn't gain xp or anything from it but it would be fun :)
3. Different game modes with different mechanics like categories but all separate instead of being all the same and bunched up together you can pick a specific map you want to play

[Yes i know this game was just released but just some ideas :)]
P.S 4. Also maybe a tournament game mode with like 10 - 20 games and 3rd 2nd and 1st can win cash prizes while runner ups can win kudos."
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,reminded me of Takeshi's Castle.. love it
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Wipeout battle Royale
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,So basically wipeout battle royale?
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Takeshi Castle is here bois
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,How is this a battle royale game? Lol It’s an obstacle course/ mini-game/ party game like fusion frenzy
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"""You're always shooting a gun and running from an encroaching circle.""
Tetris 99: ""Am I a joke to you?"""
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,The team games kill it for me
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Not jelly beans....POTATO PEOPLE!!!
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,This game would be great if I was able to actually play it
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Because of the team games i stopped playing...
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,This game came out of nowhere
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Is it free to play ?
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"This game deserved at least an 8. It's different, fun, hilarious at times, and an overall good time for hours on end!"
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,I got drunk and had a ball playing this.
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,-cough cough what about pubg cough cough-
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Finally a video game that represents my body type
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,20 bucks is steep for such a shallow game
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"So it's battle royale crossed with ""It's a Knockout""? SOLD!!!!!"
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"you guys need to have patience with the servers, they're just indie games. if this is activision create this game and crashes all the time that is the time to get angry. 
for PS4 old players you get this for free so stop whining like little kids!"
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"definitely liking the game so far,but they need a bigger server for this game."
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,The guy just being dragged by the rotating thing! I died with laughter.
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"My girlfriend isn’t a gamer, and I thought this game looked perfect to have some fun with her on a game - was gutted when I found out it doesn’t have split screen, this type of game is crying out for local multiplayer"
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"What do we always say?

*""DON'T GET ELIMINATED!""*"
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,I hate the fucking seesaw level.
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"Fix the servers, thanks"
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Is it going to be on Xbox as well?
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Connection error
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Have you considered intercepting the person with the tail rather than chasing them? There's more of you then them
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,TLDW it’s good
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"My wife and I got the game. It has a lot of potential, however that being said the most annoying part of the game is their collision system where you randomly collide with other players, having them screw you over. Yeah it definitely takes a lot of the fun out of it."
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"I couldn't get it to work. It kept saying disconnected from server at the load in screen. Checked my high speed connection and it was fine. Maybe the server was overloaded? Maybe I'll try again one day, it looks fun"
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Broke af
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,No thank you. I’m too busy playing this beautiful thing called Hollow Knight.
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,I NEED TO PLAY THIS!!
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,connection error every time i try to play... 1/10
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,I love fall guys but the boys ain’t vibin with it 😢
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,sever constantly crash or offline...
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,so bassically what mario party should of been
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Why not have on xbox 😭
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,The only battle royale game worth a damn
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"They give this a 7 and they give Warzone a 7. 🙄
It's like taking casual chess players rated 1100 and having them analyze chess master tournaments."
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"I'm not a huge fan of platform (jump puzzle) games, I played Bubzy back in the day, hated Mario except 64 and Kart but this seems fun"
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"It's great for a laugh, and you will cry with laughter... For a while. The very same mechanics that are so hilarious in the beginning soon lead to frustration though."
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"THIS GAME IS NOT PRACTICING SOCIAL DISTANCING!!
VERDICT = BILL GATES QUANTUM DOT TATTOOS + UNLIMITED VACCINES"
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,10
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,I played a few rounds closest I got to winning and servers fell over with 7 left. I wish the game rotation was better seems like same games come up loads
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Too bad i like it but i dont have a ps4
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,They need to fix there servers badly 5 outta 10 it is fun when u can ACTUALLY play it
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,fall gays what the hell
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"It's more about luck than skill most times, but it is fun, albeit sometimes frustrating, when you can actually play it. I wish that I controlled/handled a little tighter, but it's still fine. Can't wait for newer levels, as I think I've finally seen at least 20 of the 23-25 in existence. Some levels need to be re-worked a bit more, though. 7/10.

Edit: Considering downgrading the rating to a 6/10 due to all of the bugs and server issues. Thoughts?"
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Servers still down for ps4?
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"Got only 3 wins so far. But I like the solo matches. But to me, it all falls apart with the team games and tail grabbing games with the servers allowing players to snag your tail from a mile away but makes it hard to snag a tail from someone while touching them."
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,Anyone without a brain is attracted by pretty colors
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"If the servers are good , can give a solid 9/10 for having fun ,it's not always about the competitive spirit"
Outlast,Well this video just hit 30k views out of no where. Love you.
Outlast,The anxiety it feels you with hoping you don't run into Chris inna dark prison corridor is immense
Outlast,when the vid started i had flash back of the human centipede
Outlast,"The best and scariest horror game for me has got to be Madison. Now I haven't played any of the Outlast games, but I refuse to believe there's a scarier horror game than Madison."
Outlast,amnesia> outlast
Outlast,"You said at the beginning, that you played Outlast 2 before 1, and you make occasional references to that game.  I am genuinely curious on your thoughts on the game, and why you ranked it lower than the original."
Outlast,Alien Isolation is the best horror game
Outlast,"this video deserves a lot more of views, its such a good review"
Outlast,"I think Outlast is pretty scary, but honestly, the best horror game to me doesn't happen in an asylum, it happens on a small town, and a letter of my wife who died 3 years ago 🗿"
Outlast,"Great game, but I highly doubt it's the best horror game"
Outlast,"Kind of late. I don't usually comment but I loved this video, I just had to say something. Your narrating was pretty good, and your sense of humor is great. I enjoyed every single joke, whether it was a joke said, or an edit. When this game came out I told everyone how good it is. You woke up my love for this game. It truly is amazing so thank you and thank Red Barrels. Very few horror games do it so well while having a sht ton of lore and story to go with it"
Outlast,"Spoilers: It's not, and you're an idiot if you think otherwise."
Outlast,"WATCH THIS BEFORE YOU BUY NO SPOILERS:   


Disappointed i was expecting this game to be scarier not bragging i was scared only the first 2 hours and the game is 5-6 hours dont get me wrong i was scared at every jumpscares but as everyone knows outlast is based on chasedowns as i said the first 2 hours i was scared but then chasedowns became less and less scarier i just wasnt feeling the same anxiety because they becamed noticable that there gonna be a chasedown if u play the game ur gonna understand my point overall i give it a 7/10 still is a great horror game i love the concept with the camera i just wanted more jumpscares and unexpected chasedown(my opinion) JUMPSCARES:8'5/10
CHASEDOWNS:6'5/10
STORY:8/10
ATMOSPHERE:10/10"
Outlast,"This game is so scary I couldn't even finish it, and I'm desensitized to a lot of stuff"
Outlast,"Outlast is so good but it's not really scary once you realize you can outrun every single enemy, even the walrider"
Outlast,"I grew up on this game (I know it sounds bad) and I love this game! The tension is amazing and the graphics for a 2013(?) game is amazing! All the characters have good backstories, at least the main ones and the desings are amazing on every character, even Miles/Waylon/Blake fall into it!
All in all, Outlast is amazing and I love it!"
Outlast,I would say it's up there with silent hill 2
Outlast,"This game was not scary at all, you say you’re helpless in the game but you can outrun everybody by miles, I remember just running past the stealth sequences because it was so broken, game’s not scary whatsoever."
Outlast,Is it safe for a 12 years old to play
Outlast,"Well Otlast is a really good horror game, for me is way more interesting than the Resident Evil Series, but definitely Silent Hill is better, even the first one, for the jumpscare quality. I mean the perfection of the body scene (that jumps out of the locker in the school) is just so well made. Oh, then Silent Hill 2 was made, i think it is the best horror game ever made, not only because u feel so hopeless against a creature like Piramyd Head, but even the story is something so big that even nowdays is difficult to reach"
Outlast,"I've yet to play outlast, and I haven't played all games, so I can't say this is the best horror game, but it is the best I've played. I'd go so far as to say it's the scariest horror media I've consumed. It's visage. I also cried during the twice, once during Delores'cl chapter, and once during the ending, but that's bc I'm sappy and it's kinda a really depressing game. Anyways, scariest media I've consumed, and I've watched a lot of horror movies. Highly recommend."
Outlast,"my fav is whistleblower.. outlast is legendary. i've been a fan since 2013, and i can still watch it over and over again. it became a yearly tradition; i watch someone elses gameplay every year, for 10 years now. i feel old. 😂 but i love it."
Outlast,"I think the best horror game would be SCP Containment Breach, that game makes you truly hopeless"
Outlast,Every other horror game try to reach outlast's level
Outlast,lol
Outlast,It’s not the best because Outlast Trials exsists
Outlast,"ive been saying this for years, outlast is the best horror game. its one of my favorite games altogether"
Outlast,When i finished Outlast and The DLC I had nightmares for months. The main thing that scared me is that you can’t fight back. It’s scary.
Outlast,idky but I liked outlast 2 better! I feel like the only one lol
Outlast,My favorite horror game by far. The chase scenes even today give me adrenalin rush sometimes.
Outlast,"Amazing Game 😎

And to think it was perfect? out of the box on day-1 made by a small new studio!?! 🤯 still bobbles my mind..."
Outlast,i love outlast i played the first game with the dlc on 100% (achievements) ol2 is in my opinion boring
Outlast,I COIKD NEVER PLAY PSST THE HENERATOR PSLSRT IT SOO SCARY
Outlast,"given how little gameplay there is here( almost no ressource management, no ammo conservation, no combat stategies,no riddles,no inventory management , barely any exploration etc), I really struggle to call it a good "" game"". It might be scary during the first time, but in terms of gameplay, I was just bored. Especially compared to Surivival Horror like classic Rasident Evil, Project Zero and Silent Hill. It's closer to a rolercoaster than a game"
Outlast,Who the fuck said outlast is the best horror game. I think the best horror game is RE2 and RE7
Outlast,"Outlast 1 is the perfect video game for people who suck at horror games… I mean that in the best way possible. Let me explain… A lot of horror games rely on puzzles and inventory and resource management… Outlast has none of that it just focuses on managing your camera’s battery and scaring the player. Other horror titles have a one-hit enemy that that instakills the player (think the Alien in Alien Isolation). Combined with a manual save only approach like Alien Isolation did turns fear into frustration really fast - you’re not afraid of the Alien as much as you’re afraid of having to revert to your last manual save because the Alien instakilled you. In comparison, Outlast 1 has you take damage from your enemies so if you get hit you can still run away all while leaving behind a brown streak on the floor. Frustration is greatly minimized thanks to the checkpoint system which allows you to be more scared of the enemies rather than of losing a big chunk of progress. Outlast 1 is horror junk food as it has no time wasting and progress-halting puzzles, no item management, a forgiving checkpoint system… I absolutely love it for what it is!!!"
Outlast,"Outlast was the first horror game that managed to terrify me within the first 10-15 minutes. I don't think many games except for Silent Hill or Resident Evil or the first The Evil Within managed to build this sense of unease, dread and tension within the first five minutes of starting the game. The atmosphere is Outlast imo is only beaten by the dreary, foggy atmosphere of the first 3 Silent Hill games. Cuz the setting, characters and atmosphere in Outlast & The Prequel are pretty much unrivaled imo when it comes to the literal meaning of shitting your pants terror in every corner of the game."
Outlast,the end.
Outlast,In my opinion outlast trials doesn't complete the other outlast video games
Outlast,"Outlast is the first horror game that pops into my head when thinking about the subject it’s a great game, the first horror game I brought on my switch and I’ve watched so much content of it, great video man"
Outlast,"I loved outlast for the same reason I hated it. The inability to fight back AT all. Fortunately in outlast trails they have added a way to “fight” back with the ability to kick enemies off teammates or throw a brick/bottle at then. 

However in the OG’s I always hated how your character could never fight back outside of cutscenes. 

Like don’t get me wrong if I saw Chris Walker I’d fucking run like hell same with the wall rider. But same random dude with a pipe? A scrawny old man with a pair of big scissors? 

I think any one could take them down with a brick to the back of the head. Idk I just like having some way to break free or stun an enemy.

The new Amnesia game is a great example the enemy is still unkillable but you can scare it off or stun it."
Outlast,The lore behind outlast is AMAZING
Outlast,amnesia and soma quite negs
Outlast,10:23 💀
Outlast,"You CANT forget the fact that the main game and DLC happen simultaneously. They're the same timeframe, just different characters experiencing it. Which is absolutely WILD to me. You literally see some of the events from the main game happening in the DLC. It's beautiful. A lot of the spook was yanked from me personally in the underground facility but everything else is just SO GOOD that I can look past it."
Outlast,Even while watching play-throughs on YT by guys like Markiplier playing the game is a whole other story and the in itself is amazing.
Outlast,"I took games design and animation in college, focusing on games design and almost any essay and/or projects i did had outlast as my inspiration and research."
Outlast,Outlast one is not even that good anymore it was good when it first came out I can speed running in 8 minutes and the second one is a lot better and it's longer
Outlast,Loved the first outlast and whistleblower. I don’t know if I could call it the best horror game though. I hoped Outlast II would blow my mind but it felt like a waste.
Outlast,I think atmosphere is a major factor in any horror game. Thats why RE7 is scarier than RE8. The older Silent Hill games are still terrifying because they got the atmosphere just right. Paranormal Activity:The Lost Soul VR is terrifying without weapons but Doom 3 VR is equally as terrifying with all the weapons!! Being unarmed for the sake of heightening the terror is cheap and lazy. Especially if a game warrants a sensible protagonist to arm themselves for self preservation.
Outlast,I actually live where outlast is supposed to take place
Outlast,"The real horror of this game is the feeling of hopelessness; the overwhelming sense that no matter how hard you try, things will only get worse. The moment Miles Upshur stepped into the Asylum unprepared out of ambition and recklessness was the moment he sealed his fate."
Outlast,This man sounds scarily similar to Richter Overtime
Outlast,I love CHALLOWEEN too
Outlast,"Okay, i played Outlast when i was 8. and i got hooked. Really one of the most favourite horror games, Outlast 2 actually sortve scares me lol."
Outlast,"it gets really old once you realize there's no real threat. the enemies are all slower than you except one. i played through this game, but i was bored halfway through. influential sure, but saying its the best is giving it a little too much credit in my opinion. trials has really improved upon this concept though. it acknowledges it's much more thriller than horror and made a game around with far more replayability and balanced difficulty. i think outlast is top 5 because of everything it gets right. i guess it just wasn't for me"
Outlast,Re7 dethroned them imo🤷🏾‍♂️
Outlast,"Horror is subjective, and with Outlast even though I played it through like 4-5 times I still it find it scary. It's the scariest kind of horror for me I like the sensation of being chased, and being able to to hear the attacker breathing right on my neck. I legit get stomach butterflies. I panic whenever I'm in a small room with them and have to evade them on short notice. Or when I have to sneakily hide and avoid their attention and being able to hear their footsteps and them checking the lockers looking for you. Outlast is masterful in what it sets out to do, and it's the perfect length too, you can finish it in 2 hours. Sadly outlast's success meant the influx of uninspired, similarly gimmicky copy-cat games this past decade or so which certainly sucks, but the game itself I'd would consider one of the best horror titles ever but Outlast is freaky until you realize nothing will kill you if you just keep running in a circle around the map. That's what undermines its horror. Great atmosphere, grotesque character design and decent pacing, but it all falls flat after the player realizes nothing will kill them if they have room to run and hide over and over again... 🤷🏻‍♂️☯️✌️"
Outlast,"I remember replaying outlast, i made it to the sewer pump section. I got the first pump, the one behind the shimmy wall, went to the second and hid behind the shelf. I waited for about 2 minutes, dude didn't show so I'm like ""He ain't coming"" so i open the door and guess who's there. Chris god damn walker (or at least i think that's the big dudes name) haven't screamed that loud in a long time"
Outlast,"only 2 games are scarier than outlast for me: 1)Alien Isoaltion
2)Visage
Give them a try and you'll probably agree with me"
Outlast,Outlast is the scariest game ive ever played i could play it 20 times over and still have me jumping at everything
Outlast,i will always remember the jumpscare where you climb up the hole in the floor in the prison
Outlast,i love outlast so much i dont even know why its just always perfect 10/10
Outlast,W video
Outlast,"I looked up the 14th amendment when you said ""i have the 14th amendment at all times"" So you free slaves everyday?? Your a hero!"
Outlast,"I hate the groom .. especially when I saw what he was doing to his victims.. 
😣"
Outlast,Btw you probably knew it but Chris Walker was trying to kill you so the wallrider didn't have a host and escape
Outlast,"I have played very little horror games, jus the two new resident evils and alien isolation. I do agree from what I have seen that outlast is better in pure gore and horrific imagery, but alien isolation is the best horror game for atmosphere. The game is so atmospheric it’s insane."
Outlast,Have you tries Outlast Trials yet?
Outlast,silent hill 2*
Outlast,Silent hill 2 (great game btw) have also the same problem of having too much firepower. basically you have waaay too much ammos and several weapons and even the first weapon you get (the handgun) is very very good so yeah that's why I've never considered this game as a survival horror and more of a psychological horror. Silent hill 3 fixes this issue and add even an enemy that use firepower against you
Outlast,"Meh. I dont know man. Outlast stopped being scary to me the moment i realised that big man doesnt kill me in one catch. In the basement he got me, threw me on the ground, i got up, tried to crawl to hide, he pulled me out from here, i just run a circle around him and hid there anyways. In that goofy momwnt i realized, outlast is not scary"
Outlast,"thats a great video, i would recommend the evil within i mean you can fight back in that game but weaponjs and ammo are so scarce and its really disturbing, i love that"
Outlast,Outlast is good game but idk is it just me or the game but it feels outdated atleast for me. Idk how that is possible cuz amnesia is still scary and good game.
Outlast,"outlast will forever be my favorite classic horror game out there. i first played it a couple months ago after watching hours upon hours of gameplay, and i literally loved it to bits. i finished it within 2 days, but dear god it was so worth it. the story, the unsettling vibe to it all, and the enemies as a whole really had me hooked. whilst the first game didnt creep me out that much (apart from the naked twins jumpscare, didnt expect to see some fellas junk), the second one is a game that literally scares me shitless. hoping to play whistleblower + outlast trials someday. love the outlast franchise as a whole tho, i could go on about it for hours <3333

also trager will always be one of my favs"
Outlast,"I've finished this game a thousand times. However, it still keeps the fear of death and chase alive both with its atmosphere and its characters.

I think it's the best horror game.."
Outlast,Very interesting!
Outlast,No its not lol
Outlast,What is up g
Outlast,Outlast is also pretty scary when you can't do anything exept hide and run. This relieve when you finally get to a safe spot...
Outlast,"nah, I dont agree. The game wasn't scary or creepy for me. It is atmospheric and interesting to play first time, but i definitely wouldn't call outlast the best horror game."
Outlast,"agreed, Outlast (whistleblower) is the best horror game to exist."
Outlast,One underrated aspect of outlast is that there are a voriety of deaths instead of 1 death repeated.
Outlast,If you don’t get scared easily this game is so boring. It becomes a walking/hiding/waiting sim.
Outlast,"My mom bought a faulty but working second hand hard drive where there's tons of games, classic, retro, educational, shooter, action and horror. Outlast is one of them, after months of playing it I cant get passed the part where you need to open two valves in the basement. Played the whistleblower and almost finished it if my computer decided to not be a bitch and do a bluescreen of death."
Outlast,"Despite all the disagreements imma get, I think 2 is better, it was scarier, the story was better, better gameplay mechanics, and a more interesting protagonists"
Outlast,Challahween
Outlast,"I was so proud of finishing this game, even though it happened several years after it released. I literally couldn't bring myself to continue for so long because it scared me so much, it was my kryptonite xD

And now that it's over, it's just fascinating, and I can really appreciate what a masterpiece of a game it is <3"
Outlast,Maybe there aren't enough crude horror games
Outlast,"cheap jumpscares kill this game for me sadly, and something about the design of the patients and characters is general just make them outright hilarious."
Outlast,You misspelled Amnesia
Outlast,I was too much of a pussy bitch to finish this game.
Outlast,Fun fact. The tie in media and some in game documents hint that Trager wasn't a doctor but an administrator who thought he was
Outlast,"I totally agree, thats the best horror game series ever. (1+ DLC, 2, idk bout the 3th)"
Outlast,"I've just started my journey into the depths of horror games and can already say this is far from the best horror. Outlast is a great game. The gore is amazing, it has my favorite kind of setting for horror (mental asylum), the back story behind some of the characters is genuinely interesting, Dr Trager may be the best thing in any horror game ever and I can't forget the amazing atmosphere. But no. The ending to Outlast was pretty underwhelming, the gameplay is repetitive and at times clunky and old. The game doesn't really have that disturbing touch to it stuff like Cry of Fear, Lost in Vivo and Silent Hill have. Like those games are a miserable experience in the best way possible. I like when you can reflect on the story as you go on and think if I were this character I'd probably just blow my brains out because of all the mental trauma I've got to overcome/deal with. I'll give Outlast this though it real scratches my gore loving it and it was my first BIG BOY horror game. This comments already to long and incoherent, but I just wanted to add the Whistle Blower DLC was phenomenal and I probably enjoyed it more than the base experience"
Outlast,My all time favourite horror game
Outlast,Definitely in my top5 but i still think soma and alien isolation is better.
Outlast,In my opinion Cry Of Fear is a pure raw terror mixed with a constant frightening feel of helplessness
Outlast,I’d say Outlast is more of a thriller game than horror
Outlast,"Outlast and Whistleblower were awesome. I still play it. Eddie Gluskin is my favorite character. Believe me, he was not a normal man when he went to Mount Massive. He had a sad childhood being molested by his father and uncle. I was told that when he told his mother, she didn't believe him and I think that's what started his misogynistic behavior. He later killed and mutilated women which was how he got into Mount Massive. Murkoff doing experiments on violent people like Eddie Gluskin just made him worse. My channel is dedicated to Eddie Gluskin and the voice of Eddie Gluskin which is Graham Cuthbertson. I didn't bother with O2 because I watched Markiplier's playthrough and didn't like the game. I saw some of the Outlast Trials game and that doesn't look good either."
Outlast,"It's a $1.99 on Xbox marketplace....

Is it worth it?"
Outlast,Outlast 9/10
Outlast,Outlast is a 9/10 at the LEAST
Outlast,Honestly its a 9.5/10 You will never find a better horror game simple
Outlast,"First half hour is amazing, then you realize is the benny hill show and you are basicaly inmortal, and it looses all tension"
Outlast,this game is very boring.
Outlast,IGN- game is too hard 7.8
Outlast,"""The best horror game ever""

- IGN: 0/10"
Outlast,7.8 ??!!! This is a hate crime.
Outlast,..most boring game ever played for me.. the only scaring part is to be lost without any f**king light to complete the level
Outlast,"game needs a 9/10. 
7.8 really? ign cant review anything right."
Outlast,it deserves 9.6
Outlast,What a shitty review.
Outlast,"IGN's logic:
Popular, but crap games get a score from 9/10 to 10/10.
Less popular, but better games get 4/10 to 8/10.

WTF Ign"
Outlast,After 5 Hours straight Hours i can say YOU WILL NEVER FIND BETTER HORROR GAME
Outlast,Damn I was almost died in real life
Outlast,1:46 is messed up but you will laugh
Outlast,Not hunt the batteries again! I played the Ju-On game.....
Outlast,"I understand, there isn't much content in the game."
Outlast,Scary? Lol. Far from it.
Outlast,“7.8/10 None of the female developers would blow us” -IGN
Outlast,So they give outlast a 7.8 but they give alien isolation 5.8
Outlast,"So this is basically a clone of another bad game, Amnesia?"
Outlast,"My review:
Story: 8/10
Gameplay: 8/10
Presentation: 9/10

8.5/10"
Outlast,outlast is the best horror game i ever played this game diserves 10/10 u
Outlast,Is this game still worth playing in 2020?
Outlast,You know this guy shouldn't be employed as a video game reviewer when he has to go back to past checkpoints because he ran out of batteries.
Outlast,I don’t this guy knows that you have unlimited sprint.
Outlast,Outlast deserves a 9/10 its one of the scariest games ever made if not the best
Outlast,This review is a crime
Outlast,"The game is terrifying as hell. I just thought  that the graphics of the enemies, and their animations is the thing that it was lacking. That's a bummer because everything else was great. If it weren't for that I think the game would have been legendary."
Outlast,"I dont understand why he was trying to run past big guy, theres a locker behind him."
Outlast,On sale from gamestop today!
Outlast,Whose trying to watch a fresh face play it in 2020
Outlast,"This game did what horror movie of today could
Give real chills and no unpredictable jump scares"
Outlast,"I loved playing hide and seek with Trager. I would wait until Walker was about to grab me and then slide in between to book shelves. I would just stare at him laughing. Playing this six years on PlayStation I though the graphics looked unreal. I'm playing it now on PC and the graphics aren't that great now. They're not bad, but graphics have come a long way since then."
Outlast,I'm currently in the flooded control turning on pumps. I've had to reload my game like 3 times already due to get caught.
Outlast,Can we please get a Outlast remastered?
Outlast,"0:09
Never played Dead Space I see."
Outlast,Would be nice in VR
Outlast,Free on PSN in 2019
Outlast,"“repetition and annoying gameplay sections”

find one horror game that doesn’t have some element of repetition, even amnesia in all its glory got repetitive with how the monsters worked

in regards to gameplay, how would you prefer those sections to play out? just have you press a single button in order to progress? the “find 3 things to move on concept,” while not the most creative, still forces the players to go deeper and explore places they wouldn’t be comfortable exploring under other circumstances"
Outlast,The review guys sounds spooked enough....
Outlast,The notes and do uments are a waste of time. You dont have to read them. Pluse a bad ending to the game. This couldhave been great. I agree with this review; you die until u know the routes.
Outlast,Just finished the game I give it a 9.7 game is probably up there in the best horror video games of all time
Outlast,Just finished. This game is amazing. Definitely deserves a score between 8.5 and 9.0
Outlast,the games feels like a mixture of the suffering with R E nemesis with a sllight drop of condemned CO
Outlast,"ign thinks hes a pro critic , hes just a dumbass ytouber w a platform"
Outlast,Turn the brightness way down and kick up the difficulty one notch. NOW you've got yourself a horror game.
Outlast,You played this game with super high brightness settings. Why you scared IGN?
Outlast,IZ*ONE's Hyewon brought me here.
Outlast,Just downloaded this on Game Pass.  Haven't started yet.  I'm scurred.
Outlast,Outlast is a work of art and deserves no less than a 10
Outlast,This game didn't scare me after first 15 mins. Walk in the park
Outlast,Whats the point of the game if you cant attack or kill the monsters
Outlast,8.4 at least
Outlast,"The game is great, but it is not a new genre.
If any of you are old enough to remember Clock Tower on ps1.
That game was traumatizing as a kid."
Outlast,Uninspired mission objectives? Dissaponting design choices? Lose the terror when you get too close? Wtf is he even talking about?
Outlast,"You took it down by 2.2 because of one aspect? Seriously? I can’t deny when I was playing through the story always having to find 3 things to turn on was fairly annoying, but this game should of at least gotten an 8.5"
Outlast,"He was talking about not being able to figure out how to survive until dying a few times and memorizing the ai pattern, but in the gameplay he was showing, there was literally a bunch of lockers right behind him to hide in but his dumbass tried hiding in a corner. Maybe that's why you died? Lmao learn how to play the game before reviewing it"
Outlast,Is this game worth it? On the xbox store it is on sale for 6 dollars including the whistleblower dlc
Outlast,Surprised this game isn't controversial at all with the kind of content it has.
Outlast,This game was absolutely scrap
Outlast,"Yeah, I want a gun!!"
Outlast,Das scheisshaus
Outlast,"In my opinion, outlast has an interesting story and memorable villains."
Outlast,Can you shoot the zombies?  If not whats the point in this shiite game?
Outlast,"i don't get why people hate on repetition every video game is repetitive in it's own way, it's just a matter if you are having fun with what you are repeating.If you don't like the gameplay in a game then you should't expect it to change."
Outlast,"The problem with the bad models is because hes on a console I bet, I went back to look at it on PC with graphics all the way up and its fine. The real problem is the FPS being locked at 60 on PC but it's not a huge flaw. I have no clue what he meant by getting cornered unless you literally run into a corner and stay there its impossible to get stuck. How does the ""find three levers"" part ruin the tension? THOSE ARE THE MOST TENSE PART WHEN AN ENEMY IS TRYING TO FIND YOU AND YOU HAVE TO EVADE THEM! I could imagine this guy playing Tetris or anything more difficult than putting a square block in a square hole this game has the EASIEST puzzles ever if you can even call them puzzles. I really don't know how he can take 2.2 points off just for the base game elements not being superb or how in the hell he found it to be that repetitious in one play though."
Outlast,nintendo switch ;p
Outlast,"Compared to this, until dawn is a joke (a bad one)"
Outlast,Ewww!! There was a Battlefront 2 ad lol
Outlast,Outlast is definitely the best horror game of all time
Outlast,Look at this guy playing on normal
Outlast,Its free.
Outlast,its free on humble bundle now for a limited time
Outlast,The outlast delux editon is free on humble bundle
Outlast,Anybody here because of humble bundle?
Outlast,I just got the trinity collection. i hop this review is trash and the actual game is far better than what this guy says.
Outlast,"A 7.8??? Really??? Man, it could easly be Game Of The Year in my opinion or at least in top 10!"
Outlast,Quick question Does anyone know if an 8gb labtop can handle outlast
Outlast,"Just finished this game yesterday, it was truly an awesome experience all the way through, made me jump many times as I was using headphones while playing, plus the backstory kept me interested through it all."
Outlast,"There was only one moment in this game where i ALMOST ran out of batteries.   Also said he died a lot because he didn't know what to do.  Listen, I am the absolute worst horror game player ever.  Like i will sit in a locker for an eternity but there was only one spot in this game where i died more than once and it was when you had to turn the power on for the security room in the beginning.  That is only because i didn't know how to play the game yet.  After that I probably died a total of 5 times max throughout the rest of this game.  He acts like it was hard.... IT WAS FUCKIN EASY lmao.  Definitely deserves a higher score."
Outlast,I got this fame for free and Im really liking it.
Outlast,HA 10 batteries. Obviously you never played on nightmare or insane
Outlast,not scary and boring
Outlast,10/10 for me
Outlast,"This game was free on xbox one so i gave it a shot. In the first ten minutes i knew it was shit (no wonder they are giving it away). 1. Survival horror games are only good in the third person. First person does not work.
2. I cant use a weapon but instead run around with a camera. This type of thing works well in movies but not video games. No thanks.
3. My characters constant whimpery breathing that persists even when theres nothing scary going on. I found it so annoying i finally uninstalled the game. I would advise people who want a horror type game in first person to maybe try dying light or dead island and skip this junk."
Outlast,"honestly, i didn't get scarded almost at all (won't lie, just sometimes!) but the story is absolutly a masterpiece! even if tje graphics don't shine, they look pretty good and has a realistic feeling! the characters are beliavble and u care for some of them, but they are pretty repetitve: same guys almost everywhere... i would give it a 9 or 8.5 because the characters become repetitive after a while and because i didn't get scared (really don't know how) the the realism feeling is AWENSOME! i felt like a was there, not at a computer!"
Outlast,"So let me get this straight IGN, Outlast is a 7.8 but Alien Isolation is a 5.9?"
Outlast,I hope in the sequel they allow you to atleast pick up a blunt object and defend yourself with it...
Outlast,Is this available for the PlayStation 4?
Outlast,whats the best difficulty to play on first?
Outlast,"I never have seen this review. but wtg, IGN, for spoiling those jumpscares..."
Outlast,Should I get for 5$?
Outlast,This game was free with Xbox gold
Outlast,this is my fav game and i think that it deserves a 10/10
Outlast,It's not repetitious.
Outlast,game is actually scary as Hell. I don't ever remember being scared to even walk around in a game. it's so tense it's ridiculous.
Outlast,One of my favorite games. Finished it in one very stressful sweaty palmed 3 hour play through. Worth the time wasted lmao
Shovel Knight,The game is so amazing and cool video man :]
Shovel Knight,people who likes this are OLD
Shovel Knight,do the games show up seperately on switch or is it one icon that says treasure trove
Shovel Knight,It’s got a little something for everyone.
Shovel Knight,"Not a 10?
Heresy"
Shovel Knight,"So if shovel knight is a 9 to you, what exactly would you consider a ten?"
Shovel Knight,Just got this game its awesome has a 8 bit nes nostalgia feel to it love these kinds of games 🎮
Shovel Knight,I think they should remake Shovel a knight on switch
Shovel Knight,"Do you still need the shovel knight amiibo in order to play co-op? What do the specter knight, plague knight, king knight, and gold shovel knight amiibos do?"
Shovel Knight,You only need to say you can pet a cat by pressing down near it
Shovel Knight,How long is it? And is it worth it in 2019?
Shovel Knight,Your review is what section 🤔
Shovel Knight,Oh okay 9.0 even though you’ve said NOTHING BAD ABOUT THE GAME.....yep this is truly ign
Shovel Knight,Spectre Of Torment's Artstyle Looks Like Something Out Of A Hellboy Comic In It's Cutscenes And I Love It
Shovel Knight,"why can't  people now days just play classics or new games that at least have half believable graphics. why the ""retro modern with a nu age spirit"" crap. reason to play old games to get away from the ""modern"" attitude not reintegrate it! Being a NU game doesn't make it better than the original classics. that's like giving a kid ravioli and hiding the can so he doesn't know its not a ""brand name"" and instead a cheap store house brand.-he'll like it anyway if he doesn't see the ""premium"" label."
Shovel Knight,9/10 does not do the package any justice
Shovel Knight,I'm making a shovel knight video on youtube
Shovel Knight,Brawlhalla
Shovel Knight,How much does this cost?
Shovel Knight,"0:49
""...And one that shows off everything developer Yaght Club has learned since 2014""
*Shows Spectre Knight litterally just attacking. Not moving, using items, or waiting. Just attacking.*

But seriously, bosses were too easy with Spectre Knight."
Shovel Knight,When Shovel Knight gets a lower rating from IGN than Fortnite.
Shovel Knight,Yes! Gonna get it on my swith
Shovel Knight,"does the current pc steam version of shovel knight tresure trove contain the exact amount of content as the switch version? becuase im not sure if the pc or switch version has more content, for example, the pc version is over 200 megabytes, while the switch version is about 180 megabytes."
Shovel Knight,"Says absolutely nothing bad about the game the entire video.








*9.0*"
Shovel Knight,So you get the Specter of Torment and Plague of Shadows included when you buy Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove?
Shovel Knight,Is shovel knight worth it for the 3ds?
Shovel Knight,"Shovel Knight is a perfect 10/10, and a must have indie game for anybody's collection."
Shovel Knight,"Hollow knight, a game without the hours of variety that shovel knight has gets an 9.4 but shovel knight only gets an 9.0?"
Shovel Knight,Im getting a switch..
Shovel Knight,Does the game auto save because I can’t save and I don’t want to quit the game Incase it doesn’t auto save
Shovel Knight,"All the DLCs are on the 3DS as well, right?"
Shovel Knight,"How did Fortnite Battle Royale  get a higher score than this??

Shovel Knight: 9.0
Fortnite Battle Royale: 9.6"
Shovel Knight,"I would love to try this. but what's stopping me is its trying to hard to look old. ive seen alot of indie games like enter the gungeon, binding of isaac and celeste. they look nostalgic because of the art style but at the same applying new tweaks to it. this game is just pure OLD. the art style, the music. its horrendous. please modernize this game a bit."
Shovel Knight,They will made a phisical version?(whit the gamecard)
Shovel Knight,Who here thinks Yacht club games should make a Shovel Knight 2? Also who would like to see him in Super Smash Bros?
Shovel Knight,Can't wait to play this on my switch on getting in June
Shovel Knight,Is it multiplayer on the ps4?
Shovel Knight,I'm addicted to this game.
Shovel Knight,Wait I didn't but treasure trove but I have specter of torment......
Shovel Knight,How does one review a game when it's not ready yet. Battle mode and King of Cards are still to come.
Shovel Knight,"This game is so overrated. It has its moments, but its repetitive as hell and gets frustrating fast. Scepter of torment is great but plague of shadows is meh. Id give it 7/10, but id just skip this game."
Shovel Knight,Plague of Shadows.
Shovel Knight,I was uncertain if this was a sequel or an update to the original game. Now I know that it's actually a collaboration game.
Shovel Knight,Not played the one with plague knight yet. So far though Spectre of torment has been my fave.
Shovel Knight,"24,99€ for a 8bit game on a 330€ nintendo....."
Shovel Knight,Said nothing negative and gave it a 9
Shovel Knight,price?
Shovel Knight,8 outta ten too much shovel
Shovel Knight,"So here's the thing about IGN I can't understand:

If you can't say a single bad thing about the game, and it is a ""near Perfect game"" then how is it not a 10?

For example, Super Smash Bros. 4 WiiU was great. IGN gave it a 9.8... but why? They never listed a single negative thing about the game. What is the cautious issue that 0.2 the consumer should take heed from before the purchase of the game?

On the complete other hand, there are plenty of games with 10's that still have problems. Why do they get a perfect score? They have problems. It's telling the game developers that THIS is the definitive way to go. This is perfection. In some cases, it makes sense. Give Mario Galaxy a 9.8, Nintendo fixes the problems and they get a 10 on the sequel.

Then you have Paper Mario Color Splash that goes out it's way to fix a lot of the problems of Sticker Star, and... it gets a lower score? It's not a great game, but it certainly improves upon Sticker Star.

Heck, Kirby Triple Deluxe got a 6 because it was ""Too Easy"". I mean, It's not like it's purposely designed to be simple and enjoyable by everyone for a reason. That would be ABSOLUTELY STUPID. (Sarcasm, if you couldn't tell.)

Teachers can't lower grades just because they have no reason... unless they do have no reason, and are just terrible teachers.

So basically, IGN, don't be a crappy teacher. Give a rating that tells us how good it does it's job. Tell us what it fails to do if it's not perfect. Tell us why something is truest worth the purchase.

I can tell this is a good game, because you said it was a good game, but why is it a 9. Is it the Knockback, was the ending anticlimactic, did you get a lot of cheap deaths? Specify.

So there's my little IGN rant nobody will read.


""A good critic can change the tides of consumers and the future of a franchise...

... A bad critic can do the same, but for all the wrong reasons."""
Shovel Knight,Wait. I thought this was a multiplat game.
Shovel Knight,"Best yet




9/10 wtf"
Shovel Knight,Can u play multiplayer with specter knight and plague knight
Shovel Knight,Is shovel knight only download? is there a cartridge?
Shovel Knight,"If I have the original version of the game on Wii U, how would I get this new and improved version without buying the game again? Also, is the gender swap in the Wii U version and what does the Amiibo compatibility do now that co-op is automatically in the game? Don't tell me I have a Shovel Knight Amiibo for no reason now!"
Shovel Knight,So whats the difference between Treasure Trove and Spector of Torment?
Shovel Knight,"It's absolutely criminal how few people are talking about Specter Knight's expansion, in comparison to how good it is.  If you don't already own Shovel Knight on any platform, drop everything and buy a copy.  There's an insane amount of top-tier content to go through for such a small price."
Shovel Knight,this specter knight remind me about zero on Megaman X ... awesome move and skill...
Shovel Knight,"Specter Knight was an awesome addition, but once you got the self-healing power, it became a pushover."
Shovel Knight,Has Yacht Club given a release date for the 3ds version? I've been itching to try the new campaign out haah
Shovel Knight,I already own the game for the PS 4 so do I get specter Knight for free or do I haft to buy the dlc
Shovel Knight,"amazing game, if you don't have a switch the spectre campaign just got added to the pc version. since the pc version can run on a literal toaster, you don't have any excuses not to play this game any more"
Shovel Knight,When is it coming to the wii u
Shovel Knight,"Shovel knight... My second favorite game of all time...
WHY IS THE DLC NOT ON PS4 YET !!"
Shovel Knight,"What about specter of torment makes it not a 10/10 score? I really wonder. Is it purely ""our entire offices weren't talking about it?"" Is that the final piece of scoring?"
Shovel Knight,Can definitely see Specter in the next smash
Shovel Knight,"If i buy the physical copy of Shovel Knight, will i be able to play the expansions or do i have to buy the treasure trove ?"
Shovel Knight,so this was a specter of torment review basically
Shovel Knight,"I got just Specter of Torment having never played the other games:

I've only put in about an hour or two so far but I'm a little on the fence about if I like it or not. only $10 but still the slash-jumping can be awkward and the steep learning curve is a little annoying, plus some areas feel like they force you to take damage 

I don't hate it or anything but I'm not sure if this is one I'll play a whole lot unless I can get used to the mechanics and controls 

but like I said I haven't given it a full chance just yet so I'm staying hopeful and open minded. I love platformers anyway"
Shovel Knight,The Best gets better.
Shovel Knight,"Co-op was a timed Wii U exclusive, requiring the Amiibo at the time.  Your Amiibo character can be used on the Switch version."
Shovel Knight,"I need some advice, based purely on experience and enjoyment, should I get fast rmx or snipperclips?"
Shovel Knight,besides multi player what makes treasure trove diferent from shovel Knight on the 3ds?
Shovel Knight,9/10 btw
Shovel Knight,is this for ps4 too?
Shovel Knight,"Gosh, I sure do love owning shovel knight on three different platforms and not being able to play Spectre because I can't shell out $300."
Shovel Knight,"If King Knight had a shovel, his campaign could be called ""King of Spades"""
Shovel Knight,"This looks like a good first buy for the Switch, I just wanna know how co-op is"
Shovel Knight,"""Best version of shovel knight yet""
*gives it same score as original*"
Shovel Knight,this free for 3DS users?
Shovel Knight,7.8/10 to much treasure
Shovel Knight,Ugh... body swap mode
Shovel Knight,much better than plague knight
Shovel Knight,Will we get the spectre knight expansion on other consoles?
Shovel Knight,This will be the 3rd time I buy shovel knight
Shovel Knight,is the specter of death already on the xbox version? when does the update arrives?
Shovel Knight,I can't imagine playing this with the joy on d-pad.
Shovel Knight,Can you play this game co-op without having an amiibo? On the gamepage of the eShop it says 1 player.
Shovel Knight,0:38 I uh couldnt help but notice a meer 64 genders are missing
Shovel Knight,Great to see retro platforming games still alive in 2017 (shovel knight) is great hats off to the designers great work.And deff a great title to add to your Nintendo switches library of games
Shovel Knight,9 for a DLC you know its IGN
Shovel Knight,that's....pretty cool. hope PC version has this stuff now. it's awesome watching yacht club live and working on this stuff for us. :3c
Shovel Knight,"nintendo is shit, look at the day one exclusives, it's a game that looks like from 1920 😂😂😂"
Shovel Knight,"Can we link our Wii U eshop purchases yet?  I really want all the campaigns on the switch, but I already bought it for Wii U, so I don't want to spend 25 more bucks to accomplish that.  Not that the developers don't deserve it."
Shovel Knight,song used?
Shovel Knight,I'm currently playing the first shovel knight but I think Ima about 3 quarters of the way I'm about to finish can't wait to play this one too
Shovel Knight,"If I had a Switch, Shovel Knight Treasure Trove would definitely be a good investment I could get a lot of playing time out of."
Shovel Knight,"2 questions
1.  Is it also free?
2. Is it released on other platforms like PlayStation or Xbox"
Shovel Knight,will this come out on the ps4 anytime soon? don't really want to buy a switch until Mario cart deluxe comes out.
Shovel Knight,"Literally nothing bad about the expansion was mentioned. Why did it get a 9.0? Not fanboying, just curious."
Shovel Knight,Just got shovel knight for pc does it include all the expansions for free
Shovel Knight,when a writer cant just describe the game itself...
Shovel Knight,Knock back sent me here
Shovel Knight,"This sounds like the guy from last stand media, Greg"
Shovel Knight,"Would it be a IGN review if they didnt compare the game to 50 other games?

tHis GAmE iS LikE a gAMe."
Shovel Knight,Still the best indie game. free expansions and the card game is better than gwent imo.
Shovel Knight,No cons but gets a 9. Doesn't make sense.
Shovel Knight,"No cons, 9/10"
Shovel Knight,His first sentence “it’s easy” me: sorry what?
Shovel Knight,"Do you Nintendo fanatics even realize there were other systems out there, and that they made games with these gameplay elements?"
Shovel Knight,This is probably my favorite game ever
Shovel Knight,Its masterpiece better than metroid
Shovel Knight,"Quick question, is shovel knight and shovel of hope the same thing?"
Shovel Knight,"Zelda 2 is apparently a ""woefully unnappriciated gem."""
Shovel Knight,"10/10.

Done."
Shovel Knight,Gg
Shovel Knight,0:35 your favorite game in 20:14? Ok
Shovel Knight,the only problem I have with shovel knight is the final boss its not fun to have instant kill be the main gimmick  innless it easily avoidable sure you can jump over it but sometimes you just cant reach it but in my opinion its a 9.8/10 its only a small issue
Shovel Knight,The fact that fortnite is rated higher than this...
Shovel Knight,it has a little something for everyone
Shovel Knight,hi I like the video but can you do some secrets
Shovel Knight,I honestly can’t believe that IGN gives games that are considered masterpieces a lower score than Fortnite.
Shovel Knight,2014 ! I'm just playing it now .
Shovel Knight,9/10 it really makes you feel like Batman
Shovel Knight,My little brother spent 30 dollars on this game .....
Shovel Knight,"IGN: Calls Shovel Knight the best game of 2014


*And gives it a 9 out of 10 with 0 flaws*"
Shovel Knight,9/10 really makes you FEEL like a shovel
Shovel Knight,IGN is very bad at reviewing a game
Shovel Knight,It's been 5 years already???
Shovel Knight,who knew writing reviews just consisted of comparing it to other games.
Shovel Knight,Yeah why does ign have more subs then videogamedunky
Shovel Knight,where's -1 if there's no con????
Shovel Knight,The jokes are congenial.
Shovel Knight,My friend gabby peer pressured me into this game and now I actually want it
Shovel Knight,"This game is chunky clunky and shitty, not worth it if you’re looking for a multiplayer experience. The music makes my ears bleed. Pls stop letting players bump into each other in multiplayer mode"
Shovel Knight,"The bosses in this game are all unfair


The big boss especially:))


I really love this game man"
Shovel Knight,I'm making a shovel knight video on youtube
Shovel Knight,nice review!
Shovel Knight,IGN 9/10 not 3D
Shovel Knight,I prefer battletoads
Shovel Knight,back when I trusted IGN but still didn't understand how this got a 9. OOF
Shovel Knight,"I think a retro game like this was refreshing back in 2014, but by 2019 everyone's sick of them"
Shovel Knight,"I personally don't like this game all that much. I would not ever call the recovery system forgiving. I call it absolutely brutal. If you did once, you lose half your money and get sent super far back into the level, and if you did trying to get back to your money, which is super common, you lose a ton more money and your old money disappears forever, and you get sent back to the checkpoint again, where you can keep this cycle running until you completely run out of money if you get to an area that's really hard. And it's not like the money is just for the one level, either. It's permanent, and I end up losing money a ton of the time by playing levels. And a lot of the time I die is because the controls are so uncooperative. All this makes the game hard in all the wrong ways, instead of making it legit hard platforming. The game was still pretty fun a lot of the time, but I prefer a lot of other platforms to this"
Shovel Knight,"2:57
Papyrus"
Shovel Knight,Not A Attacked Village.
Shovel Knight,Actually Not. There Is A Peaceful Village In There.
Shovel Knight,IGN Logic: That Looks Like Dan The Man Except His Shovel.
Shovel Knight,IGN 9/10 -Not Enough Shovels.
Shovel Knight,Why can't a game just one time get a 10/10
Shovel Knight,Cons: no multiplayer
Shovel Knight,Im for brawlhalla.
Shovel Knight,I hope Rayman going to be in Smash Bros Ultimate
Shovel Knight,Mario 3 the best game of all time
Shovel Knight,*S h o v e l  N i g h t*
Shovel Knight,What with the random gameplay at the end?
Shovel Knight,"I love games like this. The last few games I played to completion were Hollow Knight, Momodora, Guacamelee,  and Ori: Definitive Edition."
Shovel Knight,The best game of 2014 was DKTF.
Shovel Knight,"THIS GAME IS THE BEST THAT I'VE EVER PLAYED, 100/10"
Shovel Knight,I wouldn’t have bought this if I’d know how similar it is to mega man in difficulty and limited mobility options.. I never was a fan of mega man I just don’t have the patience for something so difficult and repetitive... I mean I beat cuphead and that didn’t feel quit as maddening as Shovel Knight
Shovel Knight,"10/10 
Would rather buy this than crack"
Shovel Knight,Super Mario Bros 3 is not the best game of all time. Super Mario World is!
Shovel Knight,Shovel Knight VS Rogue Legacy.... what do you think?
Shovel Knight,"Shovel knight vs Scrooge McDuck
Who will win"
Shovel Knight,This game needs a sequel pronto! E3 2018?
Shovel Knight,review would've been better if you'd stop overlaying screen-filling junk on the video all the time
Shovel Knight,Thank god you people love games like this! I'm so tired of hearing about call of duty!!!!!!
Shovel Knight,I got this game for Christmas with my 3DS XL 2 years ago and I played it a little but was more interested in the other games I got. I really started playing this recently and it is so addictive! I absolutely love it and can't believe I didn't play it sooner!
Shovel Knight,It’s a ten because it completely accomplished what it’s supposed to be
Shovel Knight,"Guys no cons does not necessarily mean 10/10. A game could have no cons but a non-perfect score as long as the pros aren’t high enough. But honestly, this deserves at least a 9.3 IMO."
Shovel Knight,"No cons, 9/10. WHAT THE HELL?"
Shovel Knight,I'd say there's a healthy bit of Wario Land 4 in there too.
Shovel Knight,"OK, so how would a game of this genre actually acquire a ten out of ten score?"
Shovel Knight,"Why exactly did IGN give Shovel Knight a 9/10? I have no problem with this on its own everyone has their own opinion. However IGN released a Super Mario 3D World review and gave the game a 9.6/10. While I adore 3D world I truly believe that Shovel Knight is objectively the better game! On top of this IGN gave no real reason about why the game was not given a higher score then a 9/10. It makes you wonder how much effort they put in to their reviews, but I do realize it is a little hypocritical of me to say this considering I spent only about 2 minutes typing out this YouTube comment."
Shovel Knight,"Very good game but I think it deserves a 7.
cons: very short game, reoccurring enemies between the phantom, specter, and shovel characters although each character has unique fighting styles, replay ability isn't too good because of limited exploration and limited items.  
Other than these cons the game was great and I do understand that it's an indie title. The thing that hit me the most was the length of the game but the game still felt very good and challenging at times. PS I played the switch version."
Shovel Knight,Moriarty
Shovel Knight,"https://sketchfab.com/models/e63ee509fc5544d68d145d01d3c27bce
hey guys here is a model i made of the shovel knight's helmet, please leave a like
click on the link above."
Shovel Knight,"I just played this game for the 1st time. It's easily an A+ game, soundtrack is amazing"
Shovel Knight,a 9.5 is fitting
Shovel Knight,i think this game deserves a 20 out 10  its an absolute masterpiece and one the best games off all time
Shovel Knight,He deserves a place in Smash.
Shovel Knight,Hey I love this game! It's Perfect!!! 0/10
Shovel Knight,"No cons

9.0 out of 10

Logic"
Shovel Knight,"Old school glory? Damned, I'll never get how people can spend money on games that would have looked old in the mid-late 90's!

I generally have no problem with indie-games (I love ""Orcs must Die 2"" for example!), but for one great indie game there's a lot of total TURDS! I hate this ""retro"" wave (which IMHO is a crappy excuse to not polish the graphics of your game! I have no problem if you use crappy graphics to test your mechanics etc. - but the finished product better not look like it was made in the late 80's or very early 90's :( )"
Shovel Knight,Ign game has no cons 9/10 game adds 2 free new campaigns 3 challenge modes version exclusive bosses and Amiibo compatibility Still gets 9/10 Waht ???????? Wyh??????
Shovel Knight,amazing game :)
Shovel Knight,Now to wait until Wednesday so Screwattack can introduce him for their next upcoming fight
Shovel Knight,Who else is here because of the upcoming deathbattle
Shovel Knight,What about xbox
Shovel Knight,"The Graphics looks like NES game, Music sound likes Mega Man games and gameplay looks like Zelda II the adventure of Link."
Shovel Knight,Is it worth getting it on 3ds
Shovel Knight,limited challenge?  It's so freaking hard!!!
Shovel Knight,There are NO cons and ya give it a 9 out of 10?
Shovel Knight,this looks like a mix of MegaMan and Castlevania... great!
Shovel Knight,wait you can dig up items!?!? ITS SUCH A RIPOFF OF MINECRAFT DON'T PLAY IT!!!!!!!!!
Shovel Knight,"OH HELLOOOOOOoooooo 


(btw i might be getting this game xD)"
Shovel Knight,"Is it harder than Volgarr the Viking? 
Edit: Never mind, they said its not too hard in the video"
Shovel Knight,thw cod gets 9.5 but shovel knight gets 9
Shovel Knight,How do you have zero cons and not get a 10/10
Shovel Knight,OMFG THIS GAME IS SIIIIIIIIICK
Shovel Knight,On new game plus for both both Shovel Knight and Plague of Shadows I'm stuck on the Exploratorium.
Shovel Knight,"I like the whole game except world 3 (The levels with Tinker Knight, Polar Knight, And Propeller Knight) I find them to be more frustrating than fun.  Propeller Knight on Plague of Shadows took me hours."
Slay the Spire,slay the spire is not rogue like lol. it just has the conventional aesthetics of one
Slay the Spire,"Get the "" slice and dice "" game"
Slay the Spire,So basically a more dumbed down version of Neoverse?

Slay the Spire,Reminds me of south park game truth of stick
Slay the Spire,finally! a decent review by IGN standards!
Slay the Spire,It's free with PlayStation plus now and it looks interesting. Definitely giving it a go.
Slay the Spire,Hello ps+ gamers

Slay the Spire,Currently 40% off on the Nintendo store for Switch
Slay the Spire,The Spire made me feel like Batman and then I slayed it. Truly amazing.
Slay the Spire,it really makes you feeeel like a spire
Slay the Spire,free movies
Slay the Spire,nintendo switch
Slay the Spire,the grumps
Slay the Spire,"""There's a little something for everyone"""
Slay the Spire,"This game is great, however what would truly make it a hit is a multiplayer function.

Basically if MTG was made in a Risk of Rain format, this game is it. However mutliplayer would make it exponentially better."
Slay the Spire,It's 7 dollars on a Steam Summer Sale right now. Should I buy it? Is it worth the price?
Slay the Spire,One of those rare games you can always discover more of but never quite solve. Still surprised after 400 hours
Slay the Spire,It came out on mobile devices now. That’s what I was waiting for
Slay the Spire,I love Slay the Spire
Slay the Spire,"I got this game like two years ago, played it a couple times and never played it again. I dunno why I think I just didn't really get it but a couple days ago I got back into it and I can't stop playing."
Slay the Spire,The amount of times I died on floor 33 by the Bronze Automaton is embarrassing.
Slay the Spire,Should I get this for the switch or pc?
Slay the Spire,I've been playing a similar mobile game I found called Dungeon Tales. If offers much less content but was enough to get me hooked into looking into this one. Im absolutely interested in this now.
Slay the Spire,Slay the Spire and Factorio are the two most essential GAMES of all time.
Slay the Spire,ESSENTIAL.
Slay the Spire,"""don't mistake it for a deckbuilding game like hearthstone or magic the gathering"" in fact those aren't deck building games. ""deck building"" is a very  specific sub-genre of card games (and slay the spire is a deck building game, at least)"
Slay the Spire,"quick snappy battles, perfect on the go. The cards are a nice gimmick."
Slay the Spire,This game blows
Slay the Spire,playing slow mode?
Slay the Spire,I have 180 hours in the pc version.  Just bought the switch version to start playing on the go.  Love this game!
Slay the Spire,I finished the game using the Defect class. The class really makes the game easier. You can check the strategy on my channel. I just posted the video a while ago.
Slay the Spire,So basicly dominon with rougle like elements
Slay the Spire,Buying this now for the switch!! Excited !
Slay the Spire,I thought that was ZAWARUDO
Slay the Spire,"this game looks cool but whats up with the lack of character animations?
also is it worth $19.99 on the nintendo switch?"
Slay the Spire,So hyped for this on game pass 🙌🏼
Slay the Spire,why slay the spire when you can slay this bussy.
Slay the Spire,Xbox game pass for the win!!
Slay the Spire,HS and MTG are not deck building games.
Slay the Spire,Definitely my best buy from the Steam Summer Sale.
Slay the Spire,"I can see the appeal of combining deck build and rogue dungeon, but for me, the most fun aspect of deck building is getting rare cards and building stronger deck to go against opponents with equally stronger deck. The selling point of this game is the variety each run offers, which I vastly enjoy in other types of roguelikes, but not in card games."
Slay the Spire,We are here again because it's coming to switch!!!
Slay the Spire,When will this release on Switch?
Slay the Spire,"--> says one thing bad about it
eh, 9.0"
Slay the Spire,I can’t wait to play this on switch I went to go buy it today but I guess it’s not up yet
Slay the Spire,Reminds me of night of the fullmoon
Slay the Spire,I still like Hearthstone's Dungeon Run more but I feel like I'm heavily in the minority. Still a fun game though for sure.
Slay the Spire,0:57 did this man just take thunderclap??? lul that card so bad
Slay the Spire,Night of the full moon anyone?
Slay the Spire,One of the only times I would say this looks better suited to the mobile market.....feels weird sayin it..
Slay the Spire,Best game to come out in the last decade don't @ me
Slay the Spire,"I want it on Switch for the mobility, but PC has mods.... Gah."
Slay the Spire,"The gameplay feels so slow, I'm used to having fast mode on."
Slay the Spire,"It quickly became one of my favorite games of all time. Absolutely worth getting, the base game + mods make it infinitely replayable."
Slay the Spire,"Such a great game. Solid review, Tom! 👏"
Slay the Spire,"One of the best game of 2017, so addictive"
Slay the Spire,If you like Arena/Dungeon Runs in Hearth Stone. You'll love this game.
Slay the Spire,Great review Tom
Slay the Spire,"so its hearthstone single player dungeon run - with worse graphics, riiight."
Slay the Spire,"What's Za Warudo doing in the thumbnail?

is this a Jojo Reference???"
Slay the Spire,"Man, Journalists really need to know what ""deckbuilding"" actually means."
Slay the Spire,IGN: 9.0
Slay the Spire,Hearthstone isn't a deckbuilding game in the first place.  Building a deck in the game doesn't make it a deckbuilding game.  A deckbuilding game is a very specific genre.
Slay the Spire,Hey guys! This game was amazing - and reminded me of FTL: https://youtu.be/P66-U3pDxN4 - What are some other indie games I should play?
Slay the Spire,"Sine the game is so short the problem I run into is, when the cards you are looking don drop and the game's rng is awful....its great, but the car rotation can be the reason you die.

I need to block to not die, game gives me nothing but attacks...happens...ALL the time."
Slay the Spire,The game itself isn’t much of a visual spectacle but the gameplay mechanics are simply phenomenal. Each move is almost like a puzzle where you’re tilting things in your favor as much as possible. It makes you realize how the basics are the core of any experience.
Slay the Spire,"While you can’t get the she deck over and over I do like how you they tailor the character with only 2/3 styles 

Personally I really only use the ironclad and the silent since I don’t understand the android and still haven’t gif the fourth guy but those 2 have 2 major Garbo jams you can use 

Personally for the ironclad I tend to prefer the stacking if free cards over the all out attack method while fir the silent shivs basically run my fake with some back up poison for passive (my favourite though I much prefer the iron class starter relic"
Slay the Spire,Ca caw!
Slay the Spire,"""Whatever an .EXE file is."" 🤣
Still, welcome to the glorious world of PC gaming. Best sale prices & largest game library spanning literally decades.
Plus console emulation etc."
Slay the Spire,Another good card game is.. Inscription
Slay the Spire,slay the spire came out of nowhere on release and quickly became one of the greatest roguelikes of all time with so much influence that it basically single-handedly popularized single player deck builders as a genre. love this game.
Slay the Spire,"I've owned the game for ages and only tried it for the first time the other day, and my first session lasted 10 hours. This game is fantastic."
Slay the Spire,Just finished the game in like 50 minutes 😂 I think you are hyping it to much brudda
Slay the Spire,"If you love FTL and StS, you'll probably love Into The Breach too!"
Slay the Spire,"Despite you having ~2k subs less than some other Youtuber who posted a review on StS, your review is far superior, considering the flow of your video, footage and your ability to actually speak English that is understandable without subtitles."
Slay the Spire,wowoowow
Slay the Spire,"Just looked this up because people keep recommending this to me but as someone who is more into action-adventure like games: This honestly looks boring af.
I really need something new to play right now and it's probably well explained here... AND it is on sale at the moment. But I guess you really have to have a thing for these kind of games."
Slay the Spire,Does this have permadeath?
Slay the Spire,damn... got hooked lol
Slay the Spire,"Do you mean the Star Wars CCG by Decipher? I loved that one, sad when wizards got the rights and just shat the bed on it. It'll always have a special place in my heart"
Slay the Spire,"Dude...don't use virus ""protection."" Windows Defender will sufficiently protect you against malicious programs and it's a first-party Microsoft utility. Don't bother with the third-party nonsense, they are utter trash and log your data as well."
Slay the Spire,Progression in Slay the Spire is realizing Corruption is one of the best cards in the game.
Slay the Spire,What virus protection do you have on your pc?
Slay the Spire,"Real question, did you get to A20 yet? And the *secret* ending?"
Slay the Spire,The only review I've seen of my favourite game of all time that actually has some semblance of depth to what is being said. Well done.
Slay the Spire,There aren’t many games I would call a masterpiece but this is certainly one!
Slay the Spire,"I played it on Gamepass first, then on PC with mods ended up buying it on Switch, best platform for this game in my opinion."
Slay the Spire,"I appreciate passionate reviews like this, thanks bro"
Slay the Spire,Hell of a game..this masterpiece killing my will to finally start Elder Ring.
Slay the Spire,"blessed game
blessed video
blessed comment"
Slay the Spire,Comment for algorithm
Slay the Spire,"Great vid! This game is an absolute masterpiece, I've put in nearly 1000 hours (and easily watched 1000+ too) and bought it on 3 devices, (and even gifted it to friends so they could play it!) and still never ever get bored of it. I love that there's so many ways to play it - Ascension climbing, ladder climbing, winstreaking, speedrunning, the plethora of custom modes and even the mods. A game that truly can be played forever, there's simply no mastering this game which makes it one you can always return to. Been playing the game almost daily for years and I still can't quite believe the masterful balancing act that it is, no matter how many clones and copies there are of it, nothing will quite be as good as this."
Slay the Spire,Just tell your friends to play just 1 battle. Then they're hooked. Such a great game
Slay the Spire,Roy to be honest I recently played it on Android phone and didn't know it was a PC game.
Spelunky 2,send Mitchell to review the most difficult games : )
Spelunky 2,How does Spelunky 2 get a better review than Dead Cells and Hollow Knight….
Spelunky 2,👏🏻always👏🏻use👏🏻shortcuts👏🏻
Spelunky 2,the walls are shitting
Spelunky 2,Spelunky 2? Spelunky POO MORE LIKE! This is an awful sequel and it is FAR TOO HARD. 1 out of 10.
Spelunky 2,Steamworld dig still looks better than this though :/
Spelunky 2,"""You'll probably still rely on the jetpack.""
About that..."
Spelunky 2,Hades eats this game's lunch while boffing its sister shortly after succeeding in a Machiavellian plot to take control of the company its father spent a lifetime building.
Spelunky 2,please let this guy do all the reviews
Spelunky 2,A 10/10 game. Spelunky 2 is a masterpiece. Best game of the decade for me.
Spelunky 2,"These comments just prove that people just want to hear what they already think. Not a knock against Spelunkey, looks well deserved and clearly an honest review."
Spelunky 2,Clone de spelunker
Spelunky 2,Idc what they say it’s a 10/10
Spelunky 2,stop killing the pugs
Spelunky 2,does anyone notice that a *(Certain pink spaceman)* kinda looks like HLVRAI Benry?
Spelunky 2,They got someone that is reasonably decent at the game. Nice
Spelunky 2,A great review for a great game
Spelunky 2,“6/10 A little something for everyone”
Spelunky 2,I presume it has a little something for everyone?
Spelunky 2,"should i get spelunky? i like 2d metrovania, Bullethell games."
Spelunky 2,Amazing review for an amazing game.
Spelunky 2,"Not just trying to be a fan of the series, but this game’s detail and precision, enhancements, playability, friendliness toward different play styles and runs, management of difficulty hinging largely on your error, and tidbits make it probably my favorite game for this year.

It also helps that the art style is cute and the music and sound are stellar. A rare labor of love that manages to stay in my brain so well."
Spelunky 2,Happy for the Switch version in 2021
Spelunky 2,"delete this. You have until christmas, okay."
Spelunky 2,"this is one of those games that you play if you want to enjoy the day and just relax. though it can be a bit challenging, the gameplay is direct and straightforward. no cash shop etc, no boring storylines and cut scenes."
Spelunky 2,"Yeah, I stopped listening to IGN after they said that Spelunky 2 makes you feel like Spelunky's daughter."
Spelunky 2,I love actually watching youtube
Spelunky 2,Reyevko
Spelunky 2,review a tad bit high for an indie game.
Spelunky 2,I’m 36 hours in and still no where near a win :(
Spelunky 2,I heard ign reviews are the worst and only feeling based
Spelunky 2,"No matter if you win or lose in a run, this game keeps you pumped up. There's soo much that's happening on the screen that you have to always stay vigilant. Its just one of those games that make you want to do just one more run, until you get it right, and that's why I love playing it!"
Spelunky 2,Everyone was complaining how spelunky hd was hard... so they made it harder
Spelunky 2,I just did my first true ending spelunky hd run. Now I have to spend another year mastering the second one
Spelunky 2,I’m like WHAAAATTTT!!!! Really 10 out of 10 no thanx
Spelunky 2,Just here after Tim Pool said he plays it.
Spelunky 2,Sunk Cost Fallacy: The Game
Spelunky 2,"I’ve died 980 times already, at an average of 3 minutes per play. I haven’t cleared it once. I’m still trying to open the last shortcut..."
Spelunky 2,"I don't understand IGN reviews; Hades which is a clear contender of GOTY is 9, and Spelunky 2 is 10..."
Spelunky 2,I've not played but looks great!  problem is I just saw a speed-run under 3 mins - should never have watched that :(
Spelunky 2,"Spelunku is what started it all for me as far as indie games and rougelikes go, such a masterpiece, cant wait to get this one"
Spelunky 2,Do I need to play the first game to have a better experience?
Spelunky 2,This sequel could've been an update lmao.
Spelunky 2,You sound like nerd who never showers.
Spelunky 2,I cant force myself to try it... the graphics and gameplay put me off.
Spelunky 2,This review was a masterpiece
Spelunky 2,Why am I now just finding out about this.. Been waiting on this forever
Spelunky 2,Ps4 keeping this from Xbox triggered the Zenimax acquisition.   Spencer loved the Spunky
Spelunky 2,This is the 6 game they gave to 10/10 10 realy lost his value
Spelunky 2,I completely agree with this review
Spelunky 2,As someone who got the game on release day on steam. IT'S. A. BLAST. Im hyped for online. Because I sure wanna kill my friends in co-op!
Spelunky 2,I spent 1000s of hours on the first game and just found out that this exists.
Spelunky 2,"""Model for the roguelike genere""
>isn't even a roguelike
Uhhh..."
Spelunky 2,Would be awesome if it gets released in android.Then i can play it anywhere
Spelunky 2,Should I play through the first Spelunky before I play the new one?
Spelunky 2,I just got my first win on Spelunky 2012 after 1791 runs! Does anybody know if it's better to play Spelunky 2 on a PC or a PS4?
Spelunky 2,the first game is a 10 and this one is better so it makes sense
Spelunky 2,"10/10 on an indie game? Wow, now that is a true masterpiece."
Spelunky 2,Can you play as a male? Otherwise i will not buy it.
Spelunky 2,In online multiplayer cameras are based of everyone's own characters so you don't have to follow someone
Spelunky 2,"If this gets a 10, Hades should too."
Spelunky 2,Do we know how much it will cost?
Spelunky 2,7:49 spelunky 1 had friendly fire as well
Spelunky 2,no thank you
Spelunky 2,VERDICT
Spelunky 2,"Why not put a ""no ghost"" option.Some of us like to play slow 2d games and take it easy.I HATE DA FUKIN GHOOOOOST !!!!!!"
Spelunky 2,"I'm having way more trouble on this than I did on the original,  the first area enemies are so much harder than the original ones."
Spelunky 2,"OK, but Hades is a 10, too."
Spelunky 2,"Looks amazing. Loved the first game, but need it on xbox!!"
Spelunky 2,"What about Splunker. 
The original NES game?"
Spelunky 2,This guys voice sound very similar to the Completionist
Spelunky 2,Is anyone else trying to beat the first game (which you probably uninstalled as you couldn't beat it before) in preparation for this
Spelunky 2,Can’t even get past the first level 🤣🤣
Spelunky 2,It’s nice to see Mitchell reviewing a game he loved so much
Spelunky 2,"Spelunky is a fun nice game, but too punishing and luck-based for me to take it seriously. I usually play it for about 20 minutes, then get tired of dying and go play something else. I might finish it one day. Or not."
Spelunky 2,My wallet is empty
Spelunky 2,First ten seconds and already I'm intrigued because he said that Spelunky is one of his favourite games and the video is REALLY proving it to be the case.
Spelunky 2,When IGN gets it right.
Spelunky 2,Nintendo switch please
Spelunky 2,It looks like extremely little has changed from the first one.
Spelunky 2,Mitch <3
Spelunky 2,That background looks atrocious  ):
Spelunky 2,"Absolutely Zero Music Mention
Which Is Part Of Spelunky's Iconic Draw
Yet, I Forgive You.  Great Review"
Spelunky 2,It’s like Mario but 5 times as hard
Spelunky 2,Great informative review thank you.
Spelunky 2,"If this game is anything like Spelunky 1, DO NOT play multiplayer first!  I HATE Spelunky, but it's only because the only times I ever got to play it were multiplayer, and I could never make sense of what was happening to get better."
Spelunky 2,"have ign changed the standards required for a 10 l, nothing against spelunky 2 its just this year there jas already been like 6 masterpieces and last year there werent a single one."
Spelunky 2,I clapped when I saw the 10. Perfect sequel to a perfect game.
Spelunky 2,I was 100% expecting a 8.5 even though he actually had nothing bad to say about the game. Its happened in other ign reviews.
Spelunky 2,Is this coming to switch??
Spelunky 2,"Does anyone know if Online Co-op uses the same shared camera as Local Co-op?  
Or can players move about independently with their own cameras when playing online?"
Spelunky 2,"Aww, scarab beetles only give 1500 instead of 5000 now :("
Spelunky 2,"This series reminds me of an old game I used to play called Montezumas Revenge.. I’d also like to see a reboot of that one day.. 

I guess the only downside to this kind of stuff is the challenge element.. Nevertheless I’m sure you’ll get a lot of hours of gameplay out of it.."
Spelunky 2,IGN be giving out way too many 10s this year
Spelunky 2,Waiting for a swicth port
Spelunky 2,Wish this game was on Xbox. I loved the first game.
Spelunky 2,"booring game, never will play"
Spelunky 2,Spelunky 1 is amazing. Spent so many hrs playing it on vita.
Spelunky 2,"Eh, I lost interest the moment I realized it would keep the same ""no permenant upgrades"" system as the first . I mean, it looks like there's changes, but it looks like the same old hard as nails time waster as the first."
Spelunky 2,"This is a very wholesome review. 
Thanks IGN. You convinced me to try the original Spelunky and Get this new one too.
I've seen GMTK and AoG also talk fondly about this game so this feels very wholesome and a genuine review."
Spelunky 2,This game is. 2/10 it looks like. 8/10
Spelunky 2,"I was contemplating downloading this game since it's included in my GamePass Ultimate subscription but after hearing how hard it was I'll pass. I liked really difficult games like Ninja Gaiden and Contra what I was a kid in the 80s but now that I'm 45 years old I hate hard games. I like to play games for fun and for a good story, and any game that is going to have me dying continually is a game that I avoid. I feel that any game that is intentionally made really difficult so that the player continues to die is a game that does not respect the player's time."
Spelunky 2,"I just want to point out that all of the footage was shot in the first part of the game. This could mean that the reviewer never got to Volcana or Jungle and beyond.

Just putting it out there."
Spelunky 2,"Wow did they give it an 8 because it's too hard? It's not meant to be easy. It has branching paths, more characters, more secrets, levels have 2 sides...the gameplay footage shows noob reviewer."
Spelunky 2,this review sounds like a grumpy version of the IGN video.  Spelunky 2 is way too hard for this person playing haha
Spelunky 2,"Spelunky 1 was challenging in a fun way and it always feels like your fault when you die 



Spelunky 2 is bullshit"
Spelunky 2,"Why do I feel like very single sentence in this review is followed by the same sentence, said again, with just slightly different words? (And how many times can someone say ""often"" in the same sentence)? Ugh."
Spelunky 2,"I hope you are not forced to play as a girl, cuz then i will not be buying this game, that's for sure."
Spelunky 2,Did he just blame a rogue-lite for being a rogue-lite? :O
Spelunky 2,the brutal difficulty is my favorite part of Spelunky and the progression is the skill you develop while playing. it took me 50 hours to beat the first game and i loved every second of it and im sure ill love spelunky 2 even more
Spelunky 2,"“Lack of ambition.” My guy reviews a game that’s  a week old, and has the worlds best players scrambling to try and figure out the MASSIVELY complicated and intertwining paths/endings."
Spelunky 2,who ever is playing here sucks lol
Spelunky 2,Hades realy set a new bar for rougelikes following Deadcells fresh ideas.
Spelunky 2,"""it often comes very often"" oh boy this butter has so much butter"
Spelunky 2,"Yeah.. Since the Ghost is still there, I think I'll pass.. Looks fun though, although, I wish the levels where not so messy.."
Spelunky 2,"Unless there's a 'no goddamn ghost' mode there's no way I'll ever get this. As a slow, methodical player, that pissed me off so much in the original. An easy mode with ""keep items"" would be nice, but lacking that is just a feature of roguelikes I dislike in general."
Spelunky 2,Lack of ambition you say? I don't think you understand spelunky. At all. You don't unlock items that increase your stat to make future runs easier.. this is because 1. Spelunky is an arcade game 2. Spelunky is more rewarding since the thing that it demands you level up is your skills and understanding of the world
Spelunky 2,This is how short the review for this game should of been: Same thing with nothing game changing but for sure is improved in multiple ways.
Spelunky 2,"Am a bit of angry on this review, NOT mentioned gameplay time, new items characters and ITS FAR better than told in the video, I loved the Spelunky 1 and am sure 2 is good too,, I've spent hours an hours played death match with Friends, it's ton of fun, am definitely going for this"
Spelunky 2,Is this an Android game?
Spelunky 2,is this the same game as spelunker on gameboy advance?
Spelunky 2,woah
Undertale,"""Personhood""?..

You mean Manhood and Womanhood..."
Undertale,Why everyone love this game?
Undertale,Haha Lowering the much is an understatement
Undertale,Who did the background footage. Bro petted an enemy with a yellow name
Undertale,Very bad review.
Undertale,"The game deserves a 10/10 just for the soundtrack, Anyone who argues with that hasn't played the game. One of the only trustworthy reviews by surprisingly IGN."
Undertale,Is there character customization in this game?
Undertale,"the gameplay gets annoying very soon, and you have to take long breaks so you don't find yourself having absolutely no fun at all"
Undertale,لعبة خرائية،بس حلوة
Undertale,would you let kids play it? specifically a 12yo
Undertale,6 years. it has been 6 years since this masterpiece released
Undertale,Such a low review I'd give it 12/10
Undertale,Freakin Masterpiece!
Undertale,"Undertale: 10/10
Skyrim: 9.5

I guess Undertale is better than Skyrim.."
Undertale,Just realized they snuck in a familiar noise at the very end of the video.
Undertale,Best game ever. Thank you Toby and others.
Undertale,So many ppl hate this game
Undertale,Thanks for rating my fav game a 10/10
Undertale,A TEN AAYAYAYAYAYAYA
Undertale,You dirty step bro killer
Undertale,"To everyone complaining about the rating: IGN ISNT YOU! If you like the game, that’s fine. If you don’t like the game, that’s fine. Don’t let some corporation dictate how you feel about something"
Undertale,A 10 YAHOO
Undertale,Yes this game is a masterpiece!
Undertale,Undertale is one of those games than takes grey morally situations and repaints them black and white. the way undertale handles 'it's violence is bad' message is embarrassing. Some of the most overrated writing I've ever seen.
Undertale,Who else is here from ps now?
Undertale,kinda overrated ngl
Undertale,*Seeing comments before 5 years fills you with DETERMINATION
Undertale,honestly undertale is a masterpiece. Best game I've ever played
Undertale,Worst review ever wtf
Undertale,10/10 game. One of my top 3 favorite games of all time.
Undertale,"A 10????
No way, I’d say an 8 or 9/10, it’s definitely not perfect"
Undertale,My favorite game ever ❤️
Undertale,A perfect RPG game
Undertale,1:45 me: The WHAT?
Undertale,So undertale > Xenoblade chronicles definitibe edition? Ok IGN...
Undertale,But does it make you *feel* like Frisk?
Undertale,"Chills man, hope for Deltarune haha"
Undertale,"This has the playfulness and youthful energy of something that’s obviously made by a kid, but an exceptionally intelligent kid that knows how to work a theme. He knew what he was doing with that music too. Ten really isn’t overrating it if you consider how standalone unique the combat system is."
Undertale,"Everyone:goes to snowdin 



Me:stays with toriel for hours"
Undertale,"This game is definitely worthy of the hype in my opinion. I ran through it murdering everything in sight on my first playthrough and then it made me feel so guilty at the end that I actually played through it again and spared absolutely everything to ""do the right thing"" lol. I've never experienced that with a video game before... Ever. Really tugs on the heartstrings."
Undertale,One of the best games of the 2010s
Undertale,Yes it's op
Undertale,Game of the generation
Undertale,Please get another reviewer.
Undertale,This has the best music ive ever heard
Undertale,"Undertale Has The Best Music, Story Line, And It Doesnt Care About Graphics, And Thats Why Its..... Beautiful."
Undertale,"Great review and all, but id just like to point out the first note of ""Dont give up"" at the very end lmao"
Undertale,10000000000000000000000/10000000000000000000000000000000000000000
Undertale,Eu não sei falar inglês tem em portugés
Undertale,"10/10 how, why"
Undertale,how tf is this higher than p5
Undertale,"This is one of the only times I can wholeheartedly and truthfully say I agree with IGN!
This game is incredible. The characters are funny, relatable, and lovable, every single joke they make is funny to me, I LOVE the art style, and the story was so great and beautiful that it left me in tears by the end.
Ever since I first played it back in 2017, I've been revisiting the game yearly as I do with every piece of media I absolutely love."
Undertale,Im glad for that 10 :)
Undertale,every time i think of this game i get nostalgic. seriously one of my favourite games of all time
Undertale,Haha it's trash
Undertale,"Imagine hating an OFFLINE, SINGLEplayer game because of its FANBASE."
Undertale,0/10
Undertale,I love the game but a flacking 10/10? NANI
Undertale,i just played undertale on my switch and i 100% agree with evreything in this video....i love undertale
Undertale,"so is it hard? am i going to need a walkthrough to get through it? i’m like a toddler, i’m terrible at games. i just want easy fun things (hence animal crossing has brought me back into gaming sing the old Gsme and Watch Donkey Kong."
Undertale,summer sale am i right?
Undertale,"I'm sorry but, Is IGN saying Undertale is better than Shadow of The Colossus?"
Undertale,Agreed
Undertale,CONS: art...
Undertale,"This game was a masterpiece. Don't care what the haters say.

My rating? 10/10"
Undertale,Is this game created by just one person Toby Fox?
Undertale,Anyone remember when Undertale was ruined my 8 yrs old kids and the Rule34?
Undertale,"-Amazing story that, honestly, gave me goosebumps.
-Strange characters that you learn to love very quickly.
-Not very demanding graphics, which means you don't need an absolute beast to play it.
-Masterpiece of a soundtrack.
-Different ways to play it, which will make you replay it over and over again.
-Many, many secrets that you really have to *look* for to find.
*I just can't see anything wrong with this game*"
Undertale,I LOVE UNDERTALE SOOOO MUCH!!!!!!
Undertale,This beat the witcher 3? This??
Undertale,Sans is gaster
Undertale,So........... This is better  than witcher 3?
Undertale,Eh I don’t know about 10 I would’ve probably gave it a 7.8
Undertale,Such a honest review
Undertale,"We all know rpgs like Mario and luigi, paper mario, earthbound and more"
Undertale,her voice is anoying
Undertale,I totally agree though I give it a 9.5
Undertale,This game is kinda overrated
Undertale,Heh
Undertale,my favorite game ever 10/1 4 undertale
Undertale,Sans' Soundtrack. Enough said.
Undertale,"Low Budget, High Praise!"
Undertale,2019?
Undertale,wow! this game is better than earthbound is
Undertale,"I don't like undertale because, it has terrible graphics and the soundtracks bad.😡😡😡😡"
Undertale,"When I first played this game, I thought to myself that this wasn't a game. It's just pure art: the story moves people, while it's just very simple. The game plays with your own emotions in such a way I've never experienced before. This game deserves it's 10!"
Undertale,I have never played it. I have been thinking about it. Should I get it on the switch?
Undertale,Everybody liked that

Undertale,"What kind of review is this?







It deserves an 11 for going above and beyond"
Undertale,I better not hear a single word saying that Undertale did not deserve this score
Undertale,The game is not bad but i don't understand why is has huge fanbase
Undertale,Dang a 10?
Undertale,"Hollow Knight is the most underrated game by critics. Celeste, Undertale winning major awards but HK is winning hearts. Dead Cells, Celeste, Undertale are great fun games but come on, none even close to Hollow Knight. It's perfect"
Undertale,"Game:11/10
Fanbase:-420/10"
Undertale,Who Else is here just to convince their parents into buying them undertale?
Undertale,10/10? What a joke.
Undertale,MASTAPEECE
Undertale,i agree
Undertale,"Was you held at your own Will in order to give this a 10? I mean, on a serious note, there can't possibly be a game that is Perfect with no Cons. It just shouldn't happen. You could've given this a 9 and some Decimal places, personally I think you were forced to give this a 10, for a reason not known.."
Undertale,This video proves multiple endings are done best when you dont need to see all of them to understand the story and is better when they give you different but complete arcs
Undertale,"I did the pacifist run when I played it.

I didn't particularly like this game though. I honestly don't remember much of the game except for the annoying skeleton whose name I don't even recall at this point.

Story? Uhhhh... Monsters hiding underground cuz people were mean and something something?  Giant vagina space monster at the end. That's about all I remember.

Meh."
Undertale,Wow u got that cringe humor 😬
Undertale,I mean for you to fully experience the game you play it to its fullest unless you just watch the g_nocide route on YouTube
Undertale,Your boyfriend low-key sounds like Greg Universe.
Undertale,"Probably the only video of yours I won't watch. It's not like I'm even the biggest undertale fan but you're essentially missing a completely different game. That would be like beating Nier Automata and seeing everything from the perspective of 9S but going, ""nah. I don't care to get the rest of the story""

Sure. You have the main idea of the story but the things that are cool that I'll actually wanna talk about would go over their head so it would be Pointless to even talk to them"
Undertale,what's the title of the first bgm
Undertale,Pikachu used WHAT
Undertale,"someone: plays neutral ending
someone: doesnt exist anymore because they were actually found and murdered in their own house by the undertale fandom"
Undertale,I just attempted a no mercy run. Its soooo boring and lifeless. It makes you do all the worst parts of RPGs. It is so cleaver it made me quit.
Undertale,"oh but don't forget Temmie Chan who also contributed very much to the game, so toby wasn't doing it alone after all"
Undertale,"In Skyrim, a game regarded as one of the best, in the same playthrough you are allowed to be a wonderful hero and the most heinous villain depending which quests you chose to complete. In the end you decide how to play it. Same with Undertale, if you don't want to play the evil route, you don't have to. The content is there, but it's your choice to go through it or not. The unreasonable loud opinions are a minority, they only seem bigger because are loud."
Undertale,loved it
Undertale,3:57
Undertale,"Nope, still not my type of game 😂"
Undertale,"it's honestly a good thing you didn't go back and try the genocide route. if you finish a game on genocide, it corrupts your game and never lets you play in any mode other than genocide. For lore reasons. You can even uninstall and reinstall the game and it won't change it because Steam saves your game info."
Undertale,"I do not like Undertale, is that a sin?"
Undertale,GOAT
Undertale,I didn't get this game. Please don't sue me
Undertale,00:10 this aged like milk lol
Undertale,Way to put a dead puppy in your video just casually.
Undertale,2:27 luigi laugh
Undertale,Legend of the dragoon!
Undertale,Yuo* *
Undertale,"Girlfriend Reviews: Undertale is so charming!
Undertale lore:
This scientist made a machine that accidentally ripped him apart, sending him across time & space, so his son continued his studies in Quantum Physics, making giant dragon skeleton heads named after the dad that shoot lasers meanwhile a family of goats finds a human that fell down into the mountain that they live in, so they take care of the human until it does & then the goat kid(get it) absorbs his soul & tries to lay the human down onto a bed of flowers because that's what the human wanted but the locals think the goat kid is a demon so they hurt him so goat kid lays down the human and goes back to the hole & turns to dust as you do and turns into a flower that is then taken by a lizard scientist and injected with pure determination and gains sentience then he goes to his parents and they don't recognize him so he's sad but he isn't because he doesn't have feelings only determination so he decides to commit die but he can't because if he dies he goes back in time to when he is alive so he goes through life as a nice guy a thousand times and then gets bored so he decides to kill everyone and then he finds a new human and decides to try to kill him but is interrupted by goat Mom who nurtures them and then the human either decides to-
Girlfriend Reviews: ENOUGH"
Undertale,1:15 Whuhhahwaba?! What's that godly rendition?
Undertale,Pikachu used WHAT? 😭
Undertale,Now where’s the delta rune review?
Undertale,the fact that they were fighting undyne meant they did actually go through the genocide route
Undertale,Yeaaaaah...the undertale police is here and...yeahhhh...turns out your not legally  allowed to make this video if you dont do genocide route...soooooooo...(pulls out gun) yeeAaahh...
Undertale,"Too bad for you, since Deltarune points towards the True Genocide route of Undertale being the canon ending."
Undertale,"Hi guys, mind doing Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim?"
Undertale,San s s r s
Undertale,I like your videos always but this game i can't see the interest in. Glad you had fun with it though and are keeping up the vids
Undertale,Personality I prefer the Mother series
Undertale,The ending song was beautifull
Undertale,that song was nice
Undertale,"I recommend you and your boyfriend playing Mother 3 (not even earthbound) since Toby Fox has explicitly said that he was influenced by this trilogy in making Undertale, and you can see the similarities in the third entry, especially in terms of THE FEELS..."
Undertale,Beans
Undertale,I need to play Undertale again
Undertale,If you don’t like this game you are an emotionless husk.
Undertale,"if I could give You more than one like, I would <3 GR <3"
Undertale,What’s the game at 2:01
Undertale,"""No. I don't think I will.""

That sums up perfectly why I never and never WILL do a genocide run.

EDIT
""Diaherra Christmas Lights""
...I may have to refer every nuke spell from now on as that."
Undertale,"honestly, undertale is very over-rated, it wasn't that great"
Undertale,"This was great, thanks!"
Undertale,i bought the game on steam and get the pacifist ending. And then i pirate the game to get the genocide ending so then i can delete it and the cursed timeline.
Undertale,Hello fellow children!
Undertale,"Ok, I've never seen John Wick, and I have always imagined the dog as a big german shepperd kind of dog, like I am legend kinda. 
But seeing an adult crying over that tiny puppy that literally fits in his hands was heartbreaking and I did not expect it"
Undertale,Matt and Shelbie confirmed for Daddy kink.
Undertale,I alway kill them there’s no peace
Undertale,I love this game but the fanbase is toxic as hell and it makes me glad I don't follow any online communities
Undertale,this is probably my fav game. but tbh i didn't really like alphys.
Undertale,I finished the first run thinking that killing everyone was what you have to do to win.
Undertale,Wait you don't play as Sans?
Undertale,"Please review To the moon, this is best for Shelby to play, and I bet she will love the game"
Undertale,this channel lost me at the moment she said that seeing the chrono trigger combat system is not interesting.
Undertale,nah genocide route is the best
Undertale,I’m sad about all the joke opportunities you missed out on because you didn’t do the genocide route
Undertale,Loved the clip of legend of dragoon!
Undertale,5:55 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Undertale,what final fantasy game was that!?
Undertale,Are you going to play deltarune.... It's part 2 of undertale.... kinda?
Undertale,yeah it's alright
Undertale,"I hate this game. I played it just because the internet force me to and I absolutely hated it, garbage graphics, the dialogue system absolutely no entertaining combat makes this game super boring for me."
Undertale,I love it so much when you sing.. it makes quarantine so much easier
Undertale,do genocide
Undertale,"This is great. I'm glad that they played the way they wanted to. Still, there's one moment in Undertale that happened to me, and if I ever introduce anyone to the game, I'm doing it to them. The first time I played, I could figure out how to spare Toriel (I was still relatively new to video games) and my younger brother, who knew exactly what he was doing, told me that the only way through was to kill her. I believed him, but after hearing what Flowey had to say about it, I decided to go back to my previous save and look up what I needed to do. So I spared Toriel, and went to the next room completely unsuspecting, and then Flowey knew. He knew! I was so freaked out. It was an unforgettable experience."
Undertale,Well that was the most strangely touching review ever.
Undertale,Your forgetting about temmie (the person) who made the majority of the art for the game
Undertale,Only good thing about genocide route is Sans' music.
Undertale,I love undertale
Undertale,"Coming across this late, since my daughter has been obsessing about Undertale lately—spotted Legend of Dragoon in your clips! Did you both play through all of it? LoD was by far my favorite RPG growing up, it’s always good to see it get more love."
Undertale,5:14
Undertale,"hi im new here, where can we watch the actual lets play of this?  boyfriend channel ? someone point me in direction pls"
Undertale,"1:57, lol"
Undertale,"that was me. I was the kind of guy who said ""I don't think I will"" to the genocide route. fight me."
Undertale,I just ended the game with the genocide rute... And seing this made me feel an horrible person. But boi that battle against SANS its just MAD.
Undertale,"If you enjoy the music from this game check out Snowy performed by AMY TURK. She has done a full album of Zelda music too, plus lots of other classical and pop music. She is insanely talented."
Undertale,People who say that you haven't played the game properly if you didn't do genocide route didn't get the point of Undertale
Undertale,"I mean he clearly looked up how to do the pacifist ending; there are a lotta steps you gotta take to do it. It's a much more impactful experience if you go into Undertale completely blind and play it normally the first time, but it's whatever. Doing it in one run absolutely requires you to look up how to do it and go very much out of your way to get the ending the first time"
Undertale,When I started playing Undertale again I hear all the Temmie's in your voice now.
Undertale,"Girlfriend Approved for Cute Anime, Mercy, and Characters 💞"
Undertale,What
Undertale,... and then 2020 happened...
Undertale,My first experience of the game was on a discord community event. Different people played different characters as we made our way thru the game together. It was a wonderful experience
Undertale,"Excuse me, Pikachu used what?"
Undertale,"I didnt knew how MUTCH this game affected me untill me and my father played divinity original sin 2 together and he was like ""lets kill AAAALLLLLL this people, they are basicly free exp"" and I was constantly ""NO!!"" sad cat meme. 
I legit teared up when he killed a friendly bridge troll after I got us a discount by telling him stories about our advantures and my dad still didnt whant to pay even tho mantaning a bridge is a hard work and recuares budget."
Undertale,"I have the mental image of Pikachu getting choked and saying harder daddy now, thanks."
Undertale,2:32 I'm laughing
Undertale,"Now *THIS* is a Supportive Girlfriend not the ""yOu OnLy CaReD fOr YoUr ViDeOgAmEs"" type"
Undertale,"At first I was like $50k FOR THIS?!?!

I'm still kinda thinking that, but it's a cool game"
Undertale,"Ok here is the shotgun


I don't like undertale and I think it's overrated"
Undertale,Deltarune? :)
Undertale,"Although I'm sad she never experienced the genius of this game's meta narrative, I'm glad she enjoyed her time with it."
Undertale,"I feel like I'm one of the few who just genuinely didn't like undertale. Overall, I thought the gameplay was not very fun, and any aspects of morality and choice were just completely lost because I didn't buy into the worldbuilding at all. All the characters just felt like paper-thin gag vehicles and I really never ended up feeling bad about any of my decisions to kill enemies or bosses... Oh well, to each their own, I guess. I usually like to recommend either Papers Please or the Banner Saga to people who felt undertale was lacking, because I felt they did grey morality much better, and in a better established world.

Also, the Irony is that it was my GF who introduced me to undertale :)"
Undertale,guys play cuphead
Undertale,Play Katana Zero please
Undertale,"Do a girlfriend review on deltarune, the sequel or prequel or whatever it is to undertale made by the same people. Its like the same characters but a different universe basically"
Undertale,You haven’t seen shit until you’re oc’s gone through de-sans-ification
Gone Home,You guys hate video games that's my conclusion about how why you praised this game so much.
Gone Home,TLDR: it's a story about a Lebanese
Gone Home,"this review seems fishy. no cons at all? ridiculous. the game is a static environment with many examinable but mostly pointless objects, a girl speaking a few lines every now and then and a bunch of text that tells the story of the family. thats it. no lightshow, no haunting, no crime solving, no tragedy."
Gone Home,This game was terrible
Gone Home,"I'm still confused on what this game is. Is this a horror game? If not, NOT INTERESTED."
Gone Home,Lol here kuz was wondering if it's a Horror lol just another walking simulator lol with a story? What's the story? Lol game is real dumb In my opinion lol like how is this fun? Lol walking in your washroom and reading everything's ingredients is more knowledgeable lol
Gone Home,9.5? hahaha
Gone Home,Stephen king should play this game
Gone Home,Papers please lost to this????
Gone Home,You must have a relative that helped make this game to give a positive review on it
Gone Home,"I don't understand...  you list no cons at all, yet give it a less than perfect rating?"
Gone Home,"I am not happy to say that the time I spent playing this game, I am not getting back. I just didn't like this game."
Gone Home,"Not a bad game/experience, but waaay overrated."
Gone Home,"I think the people that seem to hate it are the people that watched others play it, but didn't play it themselves."
Gone Home,If there is an achievement for finishing the game under a minute you know the game is shite easy 1000g tho
Gone Home,=;lkk3#333
Gone Home,Free on playstation plus in august 2020
Gone Home,"I loved this game, it had a great story.  I wish there were some/more puzzle elements, but I enjoyed it.  It's a huge house, but the story is so intimate"
Gone Home,"I played it, finished it, and then felt sad for 5 minutes. Not a sad game though but human"
Gone Home,"I really like this game. It’s got a lot of detailed atmosphere, I found the story affecting, and the soundtrack is 10/10. It’s okay for little weird games like this to exist – I don’t understand people who seem to be personally insulted by it."
Gone Home,I felt like I bought a demo game lol
Gone Home,this feels like a sarcastic review
Gone Home,Yeah... I'll take Thief II over this.
Gone Home,"i really liked the game


there
i said it"
Gone Home,Brave and stunning!!!! lol.
Gone Home,Play Firewatch instead. This game is rubbish.
Gone Home,snooze fest
Gone Home,"this game is trash
i dont know, graphis 9/10 

rest trash
You people at IGN must be the worst gamers in the world"
Gone Home,This IGN guy most be special
Gone Home,Currently free in the epic store
Gone Home,"It didn't give me any direction, so i missed some journals. What happened to the parents, why were sam and lonnie trying to do some kinda satanic ritual? Why were there no jump-scares even after hearing footsteps and door squeaks?  Kinda dissapointed honestly, the game lets you do stuff out of order and even lets you finsish without actually completing it. And what's with the weird romantic part? Totally out of place. I'd give it like a 4/10"
Gone Home,"I think I'll go play Myst, again."
Gone Home,"Criticism towards the game from the comments:
Lesbian bad
It isn't a horror
I don't have an emotional dept
👏👏👏"
Gone Home,I thought something scary was suppose to happen. But it was boring af
Gone Home,The worst most uninteresting game I've ever played
Gone Home,"Fellt like they were shoving a demo footage, even in the Silent Hills demonstration level the look of rooms in the house had tons more variety than what they showed us in this review of a whole game."
Gone Home,"People seem to kinda either love or hate this game, personally I’m on the “love” side. I just thought it was a beautiful experience, and I really liked the story. The voice actor for Sam is amazing, the soundtrack is cosy and perfectly fitting (and I like listening to it while going to sleep!) 
I definitely understand why people might not like this game, or not even think of it as a game, it’s not for everyone. I just personally adore it."
Gone Home,"This thing that calls itself a ""game"" got 9.5 while Death Stranding got a 6.8 lmao and not just DS pretty sure the likes of Alien Isolation got the same treatment."
Gone Home,"wanted to play something I've never heard of, so I was open to this...LOL. really should have got the dead uncle to show up at some point."
Gone Home,"I was looking for"" xbox, go home"" video and found this."
Gone Home,Gamer gate was real
Gone Home,HOW DID THIS GET HIGHER THAN THE WITCHER?!!!!
Gone Home,"1, you can’t make a Last of
Us or bioshock game which feel real 🤦‍♂️
2, this game is never better than What Remains of Edith finch. 
3, weird cuts"
Gone Home,Well this is the last time I turn to IGN for a game review.
Gone Home,"Sorry, guys. This game is a masterpiece"
Gone Home,But alien isolation got less than a 6 and days gone got a 6.5 ign.... fix yourself
Gone Home,Who's here because it's being given away for free?
Gone Home,Free On Humble Bundle :)
Gone Home,Cons: Nothing....Seriously?
Gone Home,"Not knowing what to expect is key in this game. I was lucky enough, to not know a thing about the game before playing it. It was an absolutely brilliant experience!"
Gone Home,"The full ""game"" in 2 minutes and 43 seconds. Can't believe I spent $15 on this! SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
Gone Home,Well this is just depressing.
Gone Home,Gone.....open a bazillion drawers....Home
Gone Home,"It’s a very short game. I felt like I just walked around a house, got some keys and codes, and boom. I finished the game. Not sure why it scored a 9.5"
Gone Home,"Video games will never be considered a form of art, as long as the gaming community keeps dismissing it themselves.

Gone Home is one of the much needed gems out there."
Gone Home,"...I don't see why anyone would call this ""boring"" just because it isn't your typical ""horror"" or action game with a detailed story-line. I actually like this game only because it's the FIRST. game ever where you can explore a house without it having to be a ""horror game"" with a bunch of jump scares in it. a actual game with peace and silence. I could play this all day. I wish they had more games like this. but nah every game they make now with a realistic house always have to be a ""horror game""....I would love if there was a life-simulation game very realistic like this."
Gone Home,This game was such a disappointment.
Gone Home,game was too do tbh
Gone Home,The game wasn’t nearly as bad and everyone says it is. It was a great story. Very entertaining.
Gone Home,It was pretty lame. I was expecting an updated version of the old point and click horror games. Instead I was treated to a teen drama and a cop out of an ending.
Gone Home,"i have finish the game last at upstairs, no ghost just a little scare of dark room"
Gone Home,"Diablo II  - 8.3/10
Gone Home - 9.5/10
wat"
Gone Home,Meanwhile gives The Witcher 3 a solid 9.3...
Gone Home,I just played it on the switch. I had just heard about it on the shop channel and thought I'd check it out. It was decent but I think it should cheaper than 15$. I thought sam committed suicide at the end at first because I didn't check the sleeping bag the first time and just went to her diary I had no idea that would be the end of the game ( I started a new game and listened to the audio commentary). I kept thinking something would jump out at me lol. I'm glad nothing did and also glad it's not a puzzle game. I hate those types of games and wouldn't have played it if it was
Gone Home,"Spiderman: 8.7
Uncharted 4: 9.0
Tomb raider:9.0
Bloodborne:9.1
Gone home:9.5
Ign seiriously has a problem."
Gone Home,I want GONE HOME 2.
Gone Home,And his jokes....you can tell someone wrote the jokes on a peace of paper and he really needs to slow down while he's reading STILL can't understand him.
Gone Home,"I can not stand Marty his lack of reviewing really gets to me and the way he ""trys"" to review games is down right embarrassing. he lacks enthusiasm and emotion when he does these reviews. Just can't get into the game or review of the game."
Gone Home,*wack*
Gone Home,9.5 really I played the game it was alright maby a 7 but 9.8 nah
Gone Home,so......this game is an explore the house type of game????
Gone Home,This is a $30 game that you can beat with no glitches in under 1 minute. Hey at least I get a Steam Refund.
Gone Home,This game got a higher score than The Witcher 3. Let that sink in.
Gone Home,Ahahahahah!
Gone Home,"Shitty game, that's for sure what this really is."
Gone Home,Shrek is love... Shrek is life.
Gone Home,"i can honestly say that the story, despite being short, managed to become my favorite literally seconds after i finished. this is officially my favorite story ever, period."
Gone Home,"Terribly overrated game by IGN. Just played through it and the main story is underwhelming. At the very least I expected to find Sam’s dead body upstairs. Without giving away spoilers, the climax is a pathetic disappointment, a build-up to nothing. Thank God it’s a short game."
Gone Home,This game is way too short
Gone Home,"If there were no cons whatsoever, then why didn’t IGN give it a perfect 10/10? >_> Makes zero sense."
Gone Home,Finally got around to playing this game thanks to games with gold and I can easily say it is one of the worst games I’ve ever played. Should have gotten no more then a 3/10. Me thinks IGN might have taken a back handed here.
Gone Home,"great game but 9.5 is WAAAAY too high, more like 7.5"
Gone Home,Love this game to every bits
Gone Home,"Don’t get me wrong might be a deep asf game , and might have great visuals , But idk if it’s better than Uncharted 4 , even after I played both nahhhh"
Gone Home,"Nah fam. I just played this game for free and it's not a 9.5 at all. If anything, it missed an opportunity to do something really cool-instead it just descended into contrived teenage melodrama."
Gone Home,Comment section is so filled with butthurt gamergate kiddies lol
Gone Home,"Lol this so called ""game"" reeks of leftist progressive garbage. No wonder why you journo cucks can't stop circlejerk about it."
Gone Home,Why does everyone hate this game with such a passion if it you dont like it doesn’t mean that it is not a great game
Gone Home,If you didnt like the game then chances are your a kid and not a very smart person. This game was targeted at adults who actually were around and a teen in the 1990s. Also....youve never truly been in love. This automatically went into my top 5 games of all time. It has the best story ive ever seen in a game. And the end is so crushing to the heart. I hope this developer continues stuff like this.
Gone Home,This is a whole different type of game.The story is told extremely well and when I finished it it had an impact on me. Of course your going to hate it if you have little patience or don't like the thought of story > gameplay. This game deserves what it gets. Putting it down because there isn't enough cool gameplay aspects or it not being a horror game just shows you have a closed mind. Honestly I feel like I'm the only one who enjoyed it
Gone Home,"Damn it why did i read the comments, spoiler alerts!!

Anyway, after playing fallout 4 and skyrim only for the last 6 months, i did spend 5 hours playing layers of fear (awesome game) this should be a nice change of pace. 

No tense on the edge of your seat jump scares just a cool exploration of the house and finding out the back story."
Gone Home,"This game was so bad lol just because something tried to promotes liberal progressive views  doesn't automatically make it good. The game was just plain boring, and the writing was subpar. It's funny how game ""journalists"" have this such high scores, but the vast majority of the public recognized the game for what it was. A below average interactive story experience."
Gone Home,Its completable in under a min its ok but not worth a 9.5
Gone Home,"This reminds me of all the hardcore Call of Duty zombie players, who say how much of a deep and brilliant story the zombie mode has."
Gone Home,Tell me why i just played this and i thought i was gonna get scared like wtf
Gone Home,"how to make the Gone home better in a few easy steps.
Step 1. keep everything the way it is.
Step 2. you keep hearing loud noises coming from the attic.
Step 3. Once you make it to the attic you find the sister.
Step 4. depending on how much time you took the sister is ether dead or you save her from killing herself.
Step 5. if you failed you would ether find her dead body with a note or hear her final words.
Step 6. if you able to piece the story together and save the sister you get the 'happy ending'.

There that's how you can make the  game better by adding some risk and a rising to keep going."
Gone Home,U can beat the under a minute and get all achievements in under 10 I wouldn't even buy this game for a dollar
Gone Home,I played the entire game thinking it was a horror game
Gone Home,Anyone else don't trust ign reviews or just me
Gone Home,Omg playing this game made me think of layers of fear which is a game that's similar to it but scary
Gone Home,What a triggered man baby
Gone Home,Thank you for this video. Thank You 🙏 🙌
Gone Home,You wouldn’t be making this review if it was a straight couple ;-;
Gone Home,Thank you! I almost payed money for this.
Gone Home,"I liked it (or at least parts of it), but I didn’t like being tricked into buying it. 

I just grabbed it at the end of 2022 because it was on sale on Switch and it looked like a fun mystery set in a time period I remember fondly. It had completely flown under my radar a decade ago. There WAS one screenshot on the shop page that included the band poster or something, but even then, there was zero indication that the whole thing was going to be about two lesbians and their evil Christian families. Even the ESRB rating only mentioned a vague “Sexual Themes”. Sorry, but that’s not good enough. They need to have a new rating for gay content for those of us who’d rather not be tricked into giving money to an agenda we want nothing to do with."
Gone Home,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Gone Home,A certain talking monkey says how to solve this.
Gone Home,"I had to see game explained after playing this just to understand the point of it, or the point of the story.  Did I miss something besides her being a lesbian?  Yawn.  I guess not.  I did like the look of the graphics, and music, but only if it had a mystery story.  Maybe use this location for a creepy game.  Murder mystery?  Danger?  Anything besides a backstory about a character being lesbian.  That had no point.  Bored, and upset with it even after forgetting if I paid much.  Saying this game was a winner of anything is like saying Ghostbusters 2016 is Academy Award worthy for similar reasons."
Gone Home,"So glad i found your review, want nothing to do with anyone’s sexuality. No wonder IGN rated it a 9.5 ❄️❄️❄️"
Gone Home,"Imagine being this upset over a video games story, because it has lesbains. Good, j forgot how pathetic incels use to be 5 years ago.,,well, I guess they're just as pathetic now too lmao."
Gone Home,J went back to the army. And became one of the mommies from the Army commercials
Gone Home,On the immortal voice of Jobbythehong.  PAID $20 DOLLARS.
Gone Home,"I was waiting for horrors, not this kind of horrors."
Gone Home,"I paid my gold nintendo coins for this, crud."
Gone Home,The game should of been about mental health you go through the house reading about your sister mental decline and at the end you find your family's bodies after your sister killed them and then herself instead of that stupid lesbian bull crap.
Gone Home,"""Can't believe lesbians exist;
IN MY GAME?! 
😤😤😤"""
Gone Home,oof never has a review so boldly missed the point
Gone Home,"If people don’t like this, that’s fine! But I just think people are misunderstanding the game and the point of it. It’s not for everyone and I understand that. But for queer people, especially queer people who grew up in the 90’s, it is an extremely moving and important experience. I just wish people wouldn’t judge it because “i don’t give a shit if she’s a lesbian”. I agree, your sexuality doesn’t and shouldn’t define you: but there is a real struggle that queer people go through, both with coming to terms with their own sexuality and dealing with homophobia from others. It’s fine if you or other people “don’t care” about her being a lesbian, but a lot of people do care. A lot of people do discriminate against people based on their sexuality. Maybe this isn’t the game for you, and that’s fine. It’s a story based art game and that’s not for everyone. Maybe go play some pew-pew shooting games instead."
Gone Home,"I CANT BELIEVE I WATCHED THIS VIDEO FOR 14:41 MINUTES, GODDDDD, HOW COULD I SPEND MY VALUABLE TIME ON THIS CRAPPY MISOGYNISTIC VIDEO, HOW DARE I, IM GONNA GO CRY NOW 😭
it was your money, your choice, just like it was my choice to sit here and watch you rip this game apart, go cry about it some more, i know i won’t"
Gone Home,"Thnx. Hahaha. 11-1-21. Saved me 5 bucks.😁👍  oh ya, LET'S GO BRANDON!!FJB👻"
Gone Home,"So I have my issues with the game, clicked this video hoping for a review that perhaps dives into some of my criticism, but....

Holy shit this man's brain is broken what the fuck is this 😄"
Gone Home,"*sigh*

I mean look, maybe it wasn't for you in the first place and i have a hard time to understand why you paid for it in the first place..."
Gone Home,Came to listen to a review of the game. Left when I realised it’s just a sensitive potato whining about feminism.
Gone Home,"Anti-SJWs have devolved so much that they're crying about a game that have lesbians. In 2014 they used to be cool when they called out Anita Sarkeesian for her woke takes on sexism in video games, and now we have this hypocritical bullshit."
Gone Home,I always thought this would be a fantastic film adaptation but I think that this story has already been told in it's most effective format.
Gone Home,"I gotta say, I think this review is a garbage take."
Gone Home,"It’s not SJW. This isn’t political. It’s just representation. Sexuality does not matter. But the representation does matter. Gay people get tired always having to play games that only involve default heterosexual characters because that’s the majority of the video game player base. Video games are designed to be relatable with characters. They’re designed to make the most amount of money it can. Heterosexuals get bothered by this idea of sexuality in games because they’ve only noticed their sexuality represented in media everywhere. Heterosexuality is the default. Flip the script in a world where only the opposite sexuality of you was always represented of you. Then the moment something comes up with something you identify with people get defensive and call it leftist SJW. Many games do pander the idea of sexuality as just a checklist and shove it down people’s throats like Andromeda just to show how progressive they are which is counterproductive , but Gone Home handled it well.  While every game doesn’t need representation it’s important to still have it. Straight men need to calm down. It’s just a game trying to tell a story about the difficulties coming out to a religious family that don’t accept you. Also his example of Gone Home’s user scores being low is accurate seeing how the player base is overwhelmingly straight men. They say they “don’t care” about sexuality, but clearly they do if one of them is making a 15 minute video about it. I’m also a conservative before assuming I’m just another liberal."
Gone Home,"I’m a fairly far right conservative and still enjoyed this game, one of my favorites in a long time. The narrative might not be something I care for too much but the creators did an amazing job telling the story. Very relaxing and immersive, I played for 10+ hours. You can see the Bioshock influences, as the creators worked on that game as well. Unique experience for a video game, I believe $20 is totally fair."
Gone Home,I see you're in love with the middle eastern values too. Good man.
Gone Home,"I honestly enjoyed this game. even though the virtue-signaling was annoying. The experience of exploring the house, the sense of dread, the 90s nostalgia, and the voice acting all made it pretty enjoyable."
Gone Home,"I just played it on the switch for the first time . Payed $3 because I heard all the good reviews.  Boy I got ripped off! When I saw the pentagram I thought , oh maybe this might get interesting.  What a let down.  🤨"
Gone Home,Gone Home is the 2nd best game of all time following Simpsons hit & run.
Gone Home,Glad I saw this lol
Gone Home,This didn't age well at all
Gone Home,I really loved this game.  It took me right back to 95.
Gone Home,The game was Kind of creepy and gave me the suspicion that I would find her like hung or chopped up but it turns out she was just a lesbian.
Gone Home,Is this a bit or is this guy for real? 😂😂😂
Gone Home,"They could have made this a horror game. They had the right atmosphere and eerie moments. But, nah, lets make it about the sim’s lesbian sister running off. 🤦🏻‍♀️"
Gone Home,"Wait, did the character not think about calling her sister’s friends or the police? If your family is missing, the first thing you should do is call the police, not wander around looking for stuff."
Gone Home,The could've made this an eerie horror game
Gone Home,"I personally loved the game. I loved being able to pour through the little details and get a sense of story as I went along. I also found it highly effective being in the skin of the main character. It's scary at first. There's a sense of tragedy pervading in the lighting, of dread in some ominous words in the notes. It didn't bother me that in culminated in an exploration of homosexuality, because I remember the time. I mostly grew up in the eighties, and the world was very different back then, significantly more intolerant and homophobic. I'm ultimately a fan of this form of narrative--getting it in pieces a little at a time, immersing myself in the world, feeling what the character feels as he/she has those details revealed. Along these lines, I highly recommend What Remains of Edith Finch (played that recently), and I'm looking forward to Tacoma, a sci-fi environmental narrative game by the makers of Gone Home"
Gone Home,"Notice the main character only says 'Hey mom!"" not ""Hey mom and dad"" in the recording"
Gone Home,"I remember hearing how great the game was (without spoilers) and how touching it was. Eventually picked it up for like $5 i think. Played it and thought the atmosphere was pretty creepy and interesting.  Then i quickly ""beat the game"". I was so confused, ""that's it? That's all?"" I was so upset to have wasted money on this 😂"
Gone Home,"I don't think it is that bad. Take into consideration that it was a bigger deal back in the nineties to be lesbian, and if you can't emphatize with lgbt community, and specially if you are in a position of privilege as a white man, and apparently you don't care to hear about a lesbian-based story, then, of course you won't love it. I think it is unfair to compare it with big games; i like to compare it with The Stanley Parable, which manages a similar playthrough, and challenges player to put pieces together. Although it is not 'that hard'  to beat, i can't deny that it is a game made with such love and appreciation, but i agree that they could've worked better on Loonnie and Sam's storyline, because for players that want to beat it fast, it is harder to sympathize with Sam, because you have to get through every little thing in the house, which can be a nightmare for persons with such little patience. This was not a problem for me, because i love games that let you explore and interact with everything, and this map was a big one, and, personally, it took me a long time to feel like i hadn't left anything behind, and even that, i found out later that there were some easter eggs. I think curiosity is key to play this game, if you are used to big games, then this will have you bored at the first 15 minutes"
Gone Home,"""This isn't a game.
This isn't a game.
This isn't a game.
This is NOT A GAME!"".

- A guy form Youtube who reviewed this masterpiece."
Gone Home,I got this on Playstation Plus. It was a waste of the month's free game slot
Gone Home,JESUS CHRIST WHAT A BORING AND POINTLESS GAME THIS WAS THIS GAME IS JUST ABOUT AS BORING AS THE TWILIGHT MOVIES!
Gone Home,Keepsake for The Pc has A really Touching Ending in The Game You play as Lydia as A New Student at Dragonville Academy I don't want to Spoil The Ending but it's really Sad I actually Cried The First Time that I Finally Beat it She was supposed to Meat An old Friend but Her Friend doesn't Show up and Something really sad happens to The Friend
Gone Home,The only good thing in this Game is The Supposed Ghost Haunting The House
Gone Home,I'M SORRY BUT THE CHARACTERS IN THIS GAME ARE SO BORING!
Gone Home,I loved this game. The only game that ever made me cry.
Gone Home,what remains of edith finch > firewatch > gone home
Gone Home,same is with last of us. I am not buying the sequel. Fuck it. There are too many good games to play for a lifetime on PS4.
Gone Home,Half way through this game i thought it was gonna turn into a double rape murder suicide... her being a lesbian instead didn't do much for me !
Gone Home,"Holy shit... After spending 10 minutes reading it is amazingly apparent that your analysis is a complete and utter epic failure. Hole, E, Shit did you miss the mark. Read a few plot reviews from professionals and you will be laughing your ass off at this nobs attempt at literary interpretation. ...When you see it..."
Gone Home,"""If the leftist media hadn't etc etc.."" ... Good thing we are doing a fair and impartial review here. I wouldn't want to feel like I was being hammered over the head by some dip shit youtuber with an agenda and not judging the review video on its own merit. Oh wait, you're literally just living hypocrisy... The game sucks for me.. I get it, but if you are so dense that you don't see why this game would really be an amazing experience for a large group of people than bud I suggest you get out of your house once in a while. And just for reference, I'm a 6'1"" beer drinking, bar fighting, car fixing, football loving American... and the game was not my flavor... but god damn stop your fucking crying about a game that wasn't meant for you. Go the fuck on."
Gone Home,Oh God you saved me from this shit! Thank you
Gone Home,GOD THIS GAME SUCKS!
Gone Home,Having A Lisbian as A Gaming Heroine can be A Great Idea but not with Gone Home They need to give The Game an Interesting Plot which They didn't do with Gone Home There is nothing wrong with having A Woman being A Great Heroine even if They are Lisbian The Game Creators just need to give Us A Great Interesting Story
Gone Home,"I enjoyed the story of Sam and the aspect to finding it out on your ""own"" (Probably because I wasn't as oversaturated as you were then you played this game). It build up a nice atmosphere of coming home and being alone. But I agree with you: This game doesn't deserves the great ratings it got. It was definetly something new at the time it _came out_ (höhö) and definetly nailed that point to put atmosphere and story telling above everything else, but for me it was to little of a game to deserve that rating. I guess I would loved some more riddles and some more and more challenging puzzles to be better and at best get a 7.5/10, but nothing more. I heard ""What remains of Edith Finch"", and ""Return of the Obra Dinn"" are games which are better in those aspects.


But despise everything I think Gone Home was able to increas the popularity of the adventure game genre (which was really needing this) and brought some fresh air. Tell Tale Games didn't. Tell Tale Games didn't felt like adventure games but more like a interactive movie (kind of like Hugo). Gone Home on the other hand encourged the player to find about the story on their own."
Gone Home,"The ""Playthrough"" you did was the equivalent to take a book, open the first page, open the last page to spoiler yourself and then complain about buying the book."
Gone Home,Can beat this game in under 5 mins lmao
Gone Home,You're such a boring person.
Gone Home,Glad to have brought this video to 1k likes.
Gone Home,"I remember when gamespot gave this ‘game’ a 9.5 because of the boxes it checked, and then gave GTA a 9.0. Worst of all was the completely disingenuous defense they have of the whole thing- toxic man babies, etc."
Gone Home,I bet this was so great because it was based on that woman’s life.
Gone Home,It's certainly plausible that SJW think and feminism are birth defects based upon the baby in utero being exposed to mutagens that ultimately diminish high order thinking like analysis and logic. These birth defects are enhanced by poor parenting as well.
Gone Home,"I didn't know anything about this game until watching this video. I have it, and it just seems like a total snooze-fest"
Gone Home,"Dull, boring, plodding, pointless. This isn't a game. This is casual nonsense that should have just disappeared into the dustbin of shit games."
Gone Home,This game can beaten in a few minutes?!
Gone Home,"It's Artsy so it has to be progressive. Their isn't any artistic conservatives, right. Oh that's right Skill has nothing to do with being artistic. You can just throw bullshit together and call it art."
Gone Home,"Why did you pay for this game if you knew exactly what the story was about and stated ""I don't care about sexuality""
This product then is not for you.
This product was never marketed for you. 
This product is designed for a different market.
This product IS EXACTLY WHAT CAPITALISM IS!"
Gone Home,Haha. Love the video!
Gone Home,I think I own this game on my xbox.  Was it free on gold at some point?  I don't see it on my list so I may have deleted it without playing it but I could've sworn I downloaded it.
Gone Home,"I’m gay, and I’m also on your side. I also take a lot of shit from the left because of it."
Gone Home,Holy shit
Gone Home,"Played this for free when it was on games with gold for xbox one. Had no idea what it was about but heard all the hype. It was creepy as shit, and then it all started, slowly. This is when i realized finding a old picture in the wall space. This is a SJW game about Lesbians. I have never returned, i have already gone home. If you like the feeling of walking in hallways for 2 hours 10/10."
Gone Home,So much anger in 2 frames :D xD
Gone Home,I'm fine with the story. The gameplay itself was just boring.
Gone Home,It was worth it as a free game for Xbox live.
Gone Home,"For what it's worth, I'm not a progressive.  At all.  But these types of games are games I enjoy in general.  Dear Esther, Everybody's Gone to the Rapture, Gone Home, The Beginner's Guide.  I don't consider Gone Home to be the best of these experiences(Dear Esther, despite how short it is, is my favorite).  Frankly, I don't actually consider Gone Home a proper game.  It's more like a book with a few interactive elements, and what you did here in your ""playthrough"" was basically equivalent to opening the book, looking at the first chapter's title, then skipping straight to the last page.

Gone Home isn't stunning and brave.  It might have been brave, had it been made in an era where the majority regarded homosexuality as immoral, but as it is, I just found it a mildly interesting tale and a bit of a 90s nostalgia trip as I walked through the house.  The reviews praising it as the best thing since sliced bread are certainly exaggerated

I admit, I was legitimately terrified at what I was going to find in the attic.  The narration had lead me to believe she might have done something drastic(aside from running away).

Fair warning, if you play more games like this, What Remains of Edith Finch will likely break your heart.  I think it's longer than Gone Home, and I was crying for about an hour after finishing it."
Gone Home,"I only finished this game for the achievements.  Other than that I hated every minute of it.  Edit: I think it's less of a video game, but a visual novelette."
Gone Home,I thought it was going to be a supernatural mystery with something bad happening to the family and you uncovered what happened to them. Not that you had a sister who ran off with her girlfriend because she was paranoid about her parents being mean to her.
Gone Home,I think Gone Home is a great game - if you want to time a soft-boiled egg!
Gone Home,"Evaluating games on the basis of cheat mode speed run play through just isn't fair. Otherwise, I agree with your assessment. Even this story could have been interesting, but is just full of klischees."
Gone Home,"haha you're such a douche, that was hilarious"
Gone Home,"Well at least its better than Depression Quest... 

Gone Home is like Firewatch - atmospheric and immersive walking simulator and thats it.

Its not a bad game but then again its nothing to fap about like those sjw pundits did."
Gone Home,The only reason this game got awards and accolades was because of the lesbian story. Make this same game with a white male looking for his straight sister who ran away with a boy. It would be criticized for being cliché and short. The fact that the little sister in the story also practices satanism(pentagram under the stairs) is highly disturbing.
Gone Home,i got it free
Gone Home,"I played it thinking it was gonna be like a subtle horror game but once i found out what was going on I was like: ""That's it? It's just lesbians?""  The ""game"" aspect is fine I guess but the story is just dumb."
Gone Home,"i got it free on ps+ having not heard anything about the game. (pc gaming had skiped me buy t the time).  i thought it was atmospheric and was expecting some monster to attack me as i explored the house but got none of that. 
   i think gone home should be looked at the same way as an experimental art house film."
Gone Home,"I think thats a speedrun!
...but seriously, what dev would put an option to unlock all the doors in the house if the goal of the game is to unlock the doors to find out what happened?!"
Gone Home,Super Lesbian power squad for the FAIL.
Gone Home,"Gone Home was one of the Free games on Xbox's ""Games With Gold"" I played a few minutes of the game got bored stopped playing and uninstalled it"
Gone Home,"Oh damn, I didn't get very far but I had been hoping it was going to be a slow-burn horror/mystery."
Gone Home,I downloaded this game when it was free on ps plus. When I finished the game I couldn’t believe how much praise this game got simply because it was a story about your lesbian sister’s journey. I feel like I was tricked into thinking I was going to play a spooky thriller/mystery and it was just a teenage relationship drama sim. Her being a lesbian is about as interesting as her being straight and going through the same journey. I was SO glad I didn’t pay money for this. I almost did because it was so highly rated.
Gone Home,"look how big that house is, just more rich kids trying to control what we think."
Gone Home,i got this shit game free.
Gone Home,"This game sucked balls. I had read the good reviews and it LOOKED like one of the spooky old house type games I enjoy. So I bought it even if it was way overpriced. Holy crap, Husband and I were pissed off! This is the most boring damn thing I've ever had the misfortune to install on my computer. We kept saying ""there has to be a payoff here"" and there was most emphatically not."
Gone Home,"I disagree with the claim that this was a game. There is no mechanic of challenge, puzzle or competition. I agree that there are redeeming features in this non-game. As an example, I liked the atmosphere of the experience. I would give this a 0/10 as a game, but only because it is not a game. As an interactive film, I would probably score it at around 4/10. It was not good, but it was not completely trash."
Deep Rock Galactic,"2:00 ah yes, grabbers. The sneaky enemy. That has a very, very distinct cry that can be heard from 4 caverns over. This might actually be the LEAST sneaky enemy in the game if you have sound enabled."

Deep Rock Galactic,Was not expecting to see Fire Department Chronicles in a Sseth video
Deep Rock Galactic,"Where ı can find this old good game on 5:22 ı need name of the pixel art game and ı tink its called in my days ""Zed zone"" but now ı cant find it help me please"
Deep Rock Galactic,The blizzard joke is even more funnier because they killed Overwatch again
Deep Rock Galactic,ROCK AND STONE BROTHA!!!
Deep Rock Galactic,"The green hue calls to you Sseth , bask in it's sickly hue and embrace Fear and Hunger."
Deep Rock Galactic,"hase someone who almost only play ""digger"", i officialy give you the right to the D Word because the ""Digga "" put me in tears you idiot 🤣🤣🤣



Khazukan Kazakit-ha ! Oh no wait wrong one.



Rock and Stone !!!!"
Deep Rock Galactic,"3:20 Just had a 3 red star lvl 1200 player ranked gunner doing this exact tactic lol, it made me sad"
Deep Rock Galactic,WE'RE RICH
Deep Rock Galactic,This feels like maxor with context
Deep Rock Galactic,"1:29 why on the ""classes"" image are some knife-eared impostors instead of true bearded ale-loving dwarves. This unbelivable insult to our company goes to the management and to the book this instant."
Deep Rock Galactic,season 5 will be a beer shortage. mark my words
Deep Rock Galactic,Fact than Blizzard canceled plans for promised Overwatch 2 PvE after this video makes Blizzard devs joke even better
Deep Rock Galactic,Seriously though you should buy this game
Deep Rock Galactic,"9:36

Brings me back to the announcment of the season 3 DLC when i contemplated the newest gasmasks.

""Those masks are entirely non-functional! They provide no real protection!""

""These masks are prefect! Protecting the face while letting that beautiful bead flow."""
Deep Rock Galactic,didn’t expect hunt showdown gameplay
Deep Rock Galactic,Do I hear a rock and stone
Deep Rock Galactic,we are rich
Deep Rock Galactic,i love diggers
Deep Rock Galactic,dude this game is buggy as shit
Deep Rock Galactic,Kill yourself immediately
Deep Rock Galactic,DANGER. DESTRUCTION OF ECOSYSTEMS. DWARVES
Deep Rock Galactic,Heh heh heh! I got tbat RJ compound!
Deep Rock Galactic,"Literally never had a bad time on this game, community is super welcoming to new guys."
Deep Rock Galactic,"this put his VPN add so smoth that i didint even realize that it was there , his comentary skills are on the whole diffrent lvl . Respect and ROCK AND STONE"
Deep Rock Galactic,is it weird that i watch your reviews multiple times..i have watched this review about 10 times....i dont know how to explain it
Deep Rock Galactic,I hate that you're trying to make C4'ing teammates chill
Deep Rock Galactic,"Bro, in my lobbies no one asks before double dipping, smh.
I get punished for picking ammo perks."
Deep Rock Galactic,Deep rock is my favorite game now. I cant stop playing it.
Deep Rock Galactic,5:01 is that...a Steeve Hypnosis video?
Deep Rock Galactic,leaf lovers special?😏
Deep Rock Galactic,The best fuckin thing that can happen in the mines is when the lobbies glitch and Dwarves can keep queueing with you. A few days ago we got 13 Dwarves in. We hit the Abyss Bar HARD after that dawg. ROCK AND STONE FOREVER
Deep Rock Galactic,ROCK AND STOOOONE ! N.B : Also always mark gold chunks... We're rich... We're rich ... We're rich !
Deep Rock Galactic,9:18
Deep Rock Galactic,There is no inappropriate time for Rock and Stone
Deep Rock Galactic,"I AM A DWARF AND I'M DIGGING A HOLE!
DIGGY DIGGY HOLE
DIGGING A HOLE!"
Deep Rock Galactic,"the original, the deep thinker, the deep.. rocker"
Deep Rock Galactic,【Sunglasses Finnish Pirates】Zoolander movie clip xD The miner xD Jesus Christ the Lord and Savior :)
Deep Rock Galactic,Song at 3:23?
Deep Rock Galactic,Joe
Deep Rock Galactic,"This review has big Max0r vibes
I like it lol"
Deep Rock Galactic,"Even after 800 hours playtime it's hard to believe that i've payed 30 bucks for the game and i'm regularly force fed huge updates with top tier quality content for free. Even the fucking battlepass is free. i've never seen anything like this before, all the dlc's are cosmetics only and there are more than enough of them to unlock in the base game. It feels like a fever dream i never want to end. I've bought every dlc and both supporter packs and i'll continue to do so. This is how you do fucking game development. I dare you Ghost Ship, do more cosmetic dlc's because i'll buy everything you throw my way. Shut up and take my fucking money you beautiful bastards."
Deep Rock Galactic,"Hey Seth, please make a video on fear and hunger it has been driving me insane the past week of my life it is a very unique and rewarding game (also cheap)"
Deep Rock Galactic,hot and chunky or thick an sticky....not ever gonna use a Flamer the same again lol
Deep Rock Galactic,Rock and Stone!
Deep Rock Galactic,Violated the NAP? The non aggresion pact?
Deep Rock Galactic,"Obligatory mention that DRG's devs deliberately crippled an accessibility feature they half-implemented, solely because they didn't ""feel"" like letting people completely disable camera and FOV altering effects."
Deep Rock Galactic,Mushroom!
Deep Rock Galactic,"If you buy it at a discount when the devs truly deserve it bought at the full price, that's some real leaf lover behavior."
Deep Rock Galactic,ROCK AND STONE ⛏️
Deep Rock Galactic,As someone who has only had the game for three days and have already played 17 hours of it I can confidently say... ROCK AND STONE!
Deep Rock Galactic,Rock! Aaaand! Stooooooone!!!
Deep Rock Galactic,RJ250 is worth the wait. Stay strong brother! Rock n Stone!
Deep Rock Galactic,I always kick drillers from my games. Pompous morons. And i main engineer.
Deep Rock Galactic,REVIEW: Fear & Hunger
Deep Rock Galactic,Don't forget! Half of that breastmilk budget was spent on harassing a woman to suicide!
Deep Rock Galactic,funny as fuck. great game and editing skills on point obvi
Deep Rock Galactic,was that a fucking gif caption in there?
Deep Rock Galactic,"Greenbeard here. RJ250 Compound was the first overclock DRG gave me.....I have only promoted the scout, thanks DRG  ROCK AND STONE"
Deep Rock Galactic,"9:38

I mean, theu have shields after all"
Deep Rock Galactic,Did i hear a rock and stone!?!!
Deep Rock Galactic,Was not expecting the PilotRedSun reference at 12:11
Deep Rock Galactic,"Once you find a single mushroom, the objective quickly changes into annoying the mission control."
Deep Rock Galactic,"This man really just said ""My Digga"""
Deep Rock Galactic,8:30 iis too accurate
Deep Rock Galactic,"Remember everyone, you can get rid of drunkenness with a Blackout Stout. Thus making Leaf Lover's even more worthless"
Deep Rock Galactic,Y’all really can’t handle that scout rizz
Deep Rock Galactic,This is great because the first time i played scout i got cave leeched.
Deep Rock Galactic,7:13 MUSHROOM
Deep Rock Galactic,I want this game now. That is all.
Deep Rock Galactic,I had to pause at 13:50 to laugh my ass off at that.
Not for Broadcast,Is this British?
Not for Broadcast,is this playable with no access to a mouse only using the touchpad of my laptop?
Not for Broadcast,This is a great review! Subbed.
Not for Broadcast,Thanks for the review!
Not for Broadcast,"Just heads up at 1:18
Alex, Sam, and Chris are gender neutral, they don't have definite gender"
Not for Broadcast,"""They're taking wealth not just from the 1% as they promised, but from every business owner in the country""
I'm sorry, where are you getting this from? Admittedly so far I've only played the first two episodes but I played them often enough to have over 150 hours in the game. Not sure where you're getting the idea they're taking money from all business owners"
Not for Broadcast,I love the quirky style that FMV games and this one’s dystopian to boot. I’ll be giving this one a try. Thanks for the review!
Not for Broadcast,"Alan, feels like it's been a bit since you gave a review! This game was on my radar, so thank you for giving us your thoughts!"
Not for Broadcast,"Whoa, this looks very interesting! Thanks for the review!"
Not for Broadcast,"I don't think this is for me personally. But it looks and sounds brilliant for those looking for this sort of game, and enjoy the themes within it. It seems that the devs of lot and effort into it, and it's paid off. It's awesome that it got a Golden Genie award too. Thanks for the review."
Not for Broadcast,"""Something new and refreshing""... They basically do this shite to the public in real life every single day. Cherry pick and spoon feed absolute negative crud to control peoples' moods and set a certain tone. It would be cool if there was a sort of dark twist to this though, kind of like the John Carpenter film They Live 😎
""Gloria, you look like shit!"" 😅😆"
Not for Broadcast,"Time to revisit this, Mack??"
Not for Broadcast,THE GAME IS FINISHED! I just bought it. o_o Rereview it.
Not for Broadcast,Out of early access today!
Not for Broadcast,"An ITV News simulator, just what I've been looking for 👍"
Not for Broadcast,"Not for Broadcast is a very stressful game, but it brings the right amount of entertainment and indeed: A breath of fresh air as it is a concept that is different from all the games we’re getting today. A game that’s similar in nature might be “Night Trap”? The adverts are wacky, the actors for the National Nightly News (Especially Jeremy Donaldson) were great. Overall: I must agree that this game is indeed: Worth A Buy. 

P.S. The Lockdown update basically took the 2020 lockdown and used it as a plot point for the game. I give them credit for this clever way of staying optimistic and productive, while making hilarious content."
Not for Broadcast,this game is a massive NO for me. it's basically a collection of quick time events with a b movie to satisfy your score.. nothing really refreshing or entertaining. if you broadcast the wrong thing it just makes you replay the section.
Not for Broadcast,did you play the update Mack  lol holy cow it was good
Not for Broadcast,"It’s a great, refreshing experience, all the devs and crew deserves encouragement. The creativity, the good vibes, I had loads of fun sofar."
Not for Broadcast,"Ah, finally a realistic news editor simulator!"
Not for Broadcast,"2:15 After probably watching around a 100 WABs or so, it took me until now to realize the 'bell' is the equivalent of a 'bleep'..."
Not for Broadcast,I really like the concept of this game and the originality but it's not for me sadly.
Not for Broadcast,"This looks great, why have I heard nothing about it!@"
Not for Broadcast,"For when you want an editing job, but can't get an editing job.    lol"
Not for Broadcast,"We used to do 'noddies 'etc in broadcast but with the rise of digital stock  (in the last 10 years) and cheaper cameras, it's standard practice to have at least a two camera setup (2x PXW-FS7 for instance) running simultaneously. The only editing for documentary / IV content is cutting between the best reactions as they happen - other than cutting down the content to fit the segment as required of course. So thankfully most broadcast production houses do things this way for this type of content. 'Reality' TV still follows the old style, or rather they take any old reaction shot and put it where they want it for maximum effect. Reality is the only 'fake' TV that sadly consumes the most resources these days - but I digress.

Live 'editing' for news environments doesn't really exist either. There is a vision switcher who follows the lead of the director and the timing of the DA. This game looks like a studio with VS, DIR and DA. Pretty neat though! I'll be sure to check it out."
Not for Broadcast,"It's always cool to get insights into your previous lives, Mack. In my opinion, none of the anchors in this game look credibly news anchor-y. But the game does seem pretty cool!"
Not for Broadcast,"Why do you bleep out your swear words, anyway? Or are selective about which ones you censor? It's not like swearing has much correlation with viewership on youtube, and the rest of your content makes it clearly not kid-centric.... My theory is what you do is just for effect."
Not for Broadcast,Not for me but looks interesting
Not for Broadcast,"Yeah, but what is the AIM of the game....?"
Not for Broadcast,Sounds great lol ;)
Not for Broadcast,This looks hillarious!
Not for Broadcast,likes like too much of a chore to me
Not for Broadcast,OK arrived expecting Night Trap - left with a big grin on my face.
Not for Broadcast,"Hey Mac, 
Love the channel...one of the very few places I come to get my game reviews. I’m not a huge fan of your politics but you’re funny as hell, have an amazing eye for games, and everyone is entitled to their opinion. Is there a specific place you like to receive requests for future reviews? I think you would enjoy Starcom: Nexus and I’d like to hear your thoughts on Void Destroyers 2. 

Please keep the good stuff coming! Even if I don’t play a specific type of game I always enjoy hearing what you have to say.

Thanks for all the hard work!"
Not for Broadcast,Stop saying actual or actually Mac.
Not for Broadcast,Buying it right now !
Not for Broadcast,I worked for the BBC live telly. We didn't have any of these issues as only leftists were allowed to be hired. So there was never any other view that needed to be censored.
Not for Broadcast,Does it have a option where you can disconnect all sources of reality?  oh wait!  that would be Trumper Mode.  lol
Not for Broadcast,"I have worked as a news editor and a technical director for years and this is actually a combination of those two jobs.  When you are working with multiple cameras in a live environment, the choice between what to take and what not to take is a split second decision and if you screw up there is no covering your mistakes because it just went out on the air and your boss probably just saw it in his office.  The game sort of captures that tension.  I lived it for 20 years."
Not for Broadcast,"""Actual"" count: 23."
Not for Broadcast,This looks like so much fun
Not for Broadcast,What a strange but unique game. I can't imagine the level of what's going on under the hood like the coding. There's so many variables and possible outcomes with the broadcast to say the least.
Not for Broadcast,Do stoneshard plz
Not for Broadcast,"Interesting game premise, but these generic woke comments are shitty."
Not for Broadcast,A plate spinner but a fun plate spinner by the look of it
Not for Broadcast,I like that it's original but this shit is an acquired taste. Not my cup of tea at all.
Not for Broadcast,looks like FNAF...
Not for Broadcast,"Mack... I love and hate you. You are trustworthy  but you piss me off.  You make me laugh but are entitled. Do not ever stop WAB, we need you."
Not for Broadcast,how can you lose your job if its not your job?
Not for Broadcast,"Did you buy it, or did you get it for free?"
Not for Broadcast,hi mate  great video I watched 1 your old videos with you giving comforting words to total biscuit made me  feel so sad that we all have lost a great guy  so keep up the great work mate you and acg are now the only 2 people I actually believe to get honest reviews thx
Not for Broadcast,"A Game i really want you to review or give your thoughts on, is Epic game store's The Cycle. A highly underrated free to play multiplayer game that takes ""battle royale"" to a completely different level, or as the developers call it, a ""F2P-PvEvP-FPCQS Royale"" 

check it out if you feel like it, play a few rounds!"
Not for Broadcast,"Christ on a bike this sounds stressful, shouldn't we be getting paid for this kind of work?"
Not for Broadcast,make stoneshard worthabuy great game cannot stop dying and playing over and over... it is roguelike dark rpg
Not for Broadcast,"They should have another segment of the game called the cnn challenge where you have to coach your crew on all the lies you will tell during the broadcast to manipulate your audience, then during the broadcast you have to edit out any contradicting context from footage to support your narrative."
Not for Broadcast,Cool post 😛
Not for Broadcast,considering this game is EarlyA it look looks amazing! I bought a new pc just for RDR2 last week and it didnt work! and still doesnt work.
Not for Broadcast,1 - 2 A and B? thats a 4 and a 3 mack :P
Not for Broadcast,"There is a DLC where you get senior members of the government in for an interview, and then assault them with questions and statements that are either false or wildly inaccurate and then shout them down, interrupt or cut them off before they get a chance to reply or defend themselves... it’s called “ THE BBC”..."
Not for Broadcast,Ahhh so basically ur a BBC boss
Not for Broadcast,"Seen a early access review on this about a month or more ago reviewer loved it to. Not my type of game but great that the developer is thinking out of the box, Totally agree Mack great review as always :)"
Not for Broadcast,BBC Simulator.
Not for Broadcast,will there be any tommy robinson DLC
Not for Broadcast,"The only way i would play this, where if some1 was paying me"
Not for Broadcast,this game looks like such hot greatness!!!
Not for Broadcast,this game looks like such hot greatness!!!
Not for Broadcast,"If this becomes a hit, can we have an 80's soft porn version?"
Not for Broadcast,This game is aggressively british
Not for Broadcast,"But if I lose my job, do the asshole that I am covering for lose his job or do I lose my job that I was not doing while covering for him? 
Now that is an interesting RL question!"
Not for Broadcast,"What a unique game, I've never seen a game like this."
Not for Broadcast,I love so much the fact that you are not an itsy bitsy liberal piece of shit 😁
Not for Broadcast,Game has a demo as well if you want to give it a go first :)
Not for Broadcast,"Wishlist , of course :)"
Not for Broadcast,It's worth a broadcast
Not for Broadcast,Can't wait to call myself the BBC or CNN and run identity politics with a massive dose of positive discrimination.
Not for Broadcast,CNN simulator
Not for Broadcast,I work for a UK broadcaster and this looks really cool! We have way way more screens and feeds but it's similar in set up.
Not for Broadcast,So this is the jewish simulator then? 🤔
Not for Broadcast,Looks fun!
Not for Broadcast,so Basically you are the BBC or CNN editor huh? :D
Not for Broadcast,Commando's 2 HD pls
Not for Broadcast,Hahaha what a weird and unique game!
Not for Broadcast,jeff zucker simulator (LOL)
Not for Broadcast,I'm gonna thum this one upp guys. Definetly worth a watch.
Not for Broadcast,So basically this game is a simulator of how the real news works??
Not for Broadcast,"This is a great review and funny game, I am really interested in this game because I have studied TV and the game is realistic. Thanks Mac for putting this game on my radar"
Not for Broadcast,"Tried the demo, loved it, this type of game is right up my street, kind of like Paper's Please."
Not for Broadcast,So it's great because the actors are great. Isn't it the wrong medium then?
Not for Broadcast,"Thank you ,Mak' 

Looks interesting ,
 (a little too stressful for my play-style , )"
Not for Broadcast,I don't think I have the brain capacity for this game.
Not for Broadcast,install the free prologue version and you get a 30% off coupon instantly.
Not for Broadcast,Old ppl games
Not for Broadcast,You dont half play some shite mack 😂
Not for Broadcast,"As someone who only 'discovered' you about a month ago and has quickly become a fan, you've sold this console gamer on this one, Mack. I've installed Steam and bought a copy of Not For Broadcast through your Green Man Gaming link. ... Now I'm just hoping I have a ""sound card"" XD"
Not for Broadcast,Can you imagine a porn version if this?! HA HA HA HA!!!!
Not for Broadcast,"0/10 not Orwellian enough and no ""diversity quota"" gameplay feature."
Not for Broadcast,CNN simulator
Not for Broadcast,I don't get it.  🤔
Not for Broadcast,hahahahaha that lemon reference tho . Yeap agree this game needs the lemon and the madcow pronto!
Not for Broadcast,looks brilliant
Not for Broadcast,What a sceam!! 😄
Not for Broadcast,The way that game is set up looks like a similar arrangement to Five Nights At Freddie's. Setting at a console and flipping switches. aJG
Not for Broadcast,This is pretty cool. I can live out my fantasy of being Jewish.
Not for Broadcast,Can you tell Trump to tell Obama to suck his Bing Bong Bing Bing Bong! O_o
Not for Broadcast,"The Journalist barely touched the grown man and he Flew like a rocket onto the bed......ehum, does she has super powers?
It took me 5 seconds into this video to realice what a Crappy bunch of ''Actors''they hired for this game. Most likely just some friends and family to the guys making it....And you talk about realism. Did you open your eyes while you played this game??!"
Not for Broadcast,China Simulator 2020. Includes Wuhan Bat Soup Expansion DLC Code.
Not for Broadcast,I was way too busy trying to read the captions of the interviews to listen to a word you were saying
Not for Broadcast,The DLC will feature Don Lemon 🍋
Not for Broadcast,So it's the far left MSM.
Not for Broadcast,CNN Simulator!!!
As Dusk Falls,Wish this would’ve came out on ps4 or ps5
As Dusk Falls,ALRIGHT BOYS …….
As Dusk Falls,Romance girl
As Dusk Falls,Wow
As Dusk Falls,Skylar
As Dusk Falls,"was obsessed w this game, total gem"
As Dusk Falls,Jay looks like Austin Rivers
As Dusk Falls,"Absolutely loving this game at the moment, it's brilliant.

I'm not gonna lie though, Vince looks exactly like Jeremy from TheQuartering 😂"
As Dusk Falls,Saw it on game pass and surpassed my expectations. Definitely recommend playing.
As Dusk Falls,why not make the animation of this game look like Life is Strange.
As Dusk Falls,Jay's voice acting is the only fine thing in this interactive cartoon.
As Dusk Falls,Based review
As Dusk Falls,This somewhat reminds me of Life is Strange.
As Dusk Falls,"I'm here after the game awards, they deserve it"
As Dusk Falls,Congratulations on winning the Games for Impact award
As Dusk Falls,This game is amazing!
As Dusk Falls,This game’s art direction is horrible. A lazy slider show with irl photos that have gone through a “painting” filter
As Dusk Falls,"Just finished the game and came looking for reviews.  This review is spot on in all respects.  If you're the kind of person who gripes at quicktime events, this isn't the game for you.
But that isnt what the game's about."
As Dusk Falls,Imagin pressing Y to skip cutscene.
As Dusk Falls,"169k views, 3k likes, 17M subs, 494 comments, 🤔"
As Dusk Falls,Imagine if Supermassive games made this game
As Dusk Falls,"The writing was so bad but some of the game play elements worked pretty well. With a better writing staff, another game like this could work very well."
As Dusk Falls,I'm really enjoying this been playing a couple of game's now.
As Dusk Falls,it's a messed up story .at least my playthrough was...Zoey never caught a break
As Dusk Falls,For all the people who only care about graphics and are whining because graphics: go play Vanguard if you ONLY care about graphics and NOTHING ELSE.
As Dusk Falls,"I'm enjoying the game and story so far, it's engaging. My only problem is that it's set in 1998 and the haircuts/fashion doesn't match the time. The story and voice acting will keep you playing until the end."
As Dusk Falls,"Wow! I'm pissed at a few of my choices. Don't eat, or look away while playing,  they will drop a choice out the blue."
As Dusk Falls,"Well, the beginning of book 2 has already got me heartbroken."
As Dusk Falls,Just watching the review made me 😴😴
As Dusk Falls,Booooooring
As Dusk Falls,"Just played this on my Series X, what a Gem, Game Pass 💪🏽💪🏽"
As Dusk Falls,Bashing it for its execution in art style just shows your lack of creativity or imagination. No current games made like this but the still frame motion is a gimmick to you? Just go back to your COD Warzone lol
As Dusk Falls,This game is fantastic.
As Dusk Falls,Detroit was better.
As Dusk Falls,"Fantastic game. Came in with very little expectations, but was honestly blown away."
As Dusk Falls,"Most boring game of all time. Nothing ro do but click box options, uninstalled after 20mins of falling asleep"
As Dusk Falls,Yet another game I'll wait for playstation 🙁
As Dusk Falls,"For all of the people complaining about this getting a 9/10, give it a try. It’s extremely heavily story based, the choices you make really matter and the characters are very relatable and you want them to get out of the situation alive and well. On top of dealing and resolving their personal issues as well. Leagues beyond most telltale games."
As Dusk Falls,Amazing game
As Dusk Falls,"Played this with my mrs, was brilliant! Highly recommend"
As Dusk Falls,It had to be done
As Dusk Falls,Not a game. Its woke. Boring gameplay. Perfect for brainwashed normies
As Dusk Falls,Just finished the first “book” (chapters 1-3) and it is absolutely incredible! This is the first interactive game other than Until Dawn I’ve played where choices actually matter. Incredible storywriting and characters.
As Dusk Falls,It's too bad it's not fully animated. The soundtrack sounds amazing though
As Dusk Falls,"Finished once , it's masterpiece, so great story"
As Dusk Falls,Time to play
As Dusk Falls,looks boring
As Dusk Falls,"Trying to understand multiplayer...so is there only one player who swipes or taps buttons and the others can only vote on decisions, right?"
As Dusk Falls,Reviews spoil to much now days
As Dusk Falls,"You have 3 options in Arizona
Become storytime animator
Join Caesar's legion
Die in a motel"
As Dusk Falls,Is there a chance for jay to end up dating Vanessa?
As Dusk Falls,Шлак.
As Dusk Falls,GTA 5 loading screen simulator. Pagman.
As Dusk Falls,Terrible frame rate
As Dusk Falls,Looks ok reminds me alot of the walking dead games kinda ok.
As Dusk Falls,Romance girl
As Dusk Falls,Wow
As Dusk Falls,Just started playing this via Xbox cloud gaming on my iPhone.
As Dusk Falls,Best game I've probably ever played
As Dusk Falls,"Lmao stray is still way better, literally a cat game"
As Dusk Falls,what a crap
As Dusk Falls,great piece of $hit
As Dusk Falls,Just downloaded it on my series x
As Dusk Falls,It's a game that doesn't require much gameplay and skill... Of course they rate this highly.
As Dusk Falls,"PowerPoint game 9/10, seriously?"
As Dusk Falls,Clicking through PowerPoint slides about interest rates would be marginally more thrilling than this. At least it would be free. Who would seriously play this so-called game if it wasn’t on game pass?
As Dusk Falls,Leftist political propaganda more woke nonsense
As Dusk Falls,is multi-player not working for anyone else?
As Dusk Falls,10/10 Loved it.... will need to replay it
As Dusk Falls,Gta loading screens
As Dusk Falls,The game is normal.  But the graphics are crap.  Slide show in PowerPoint
As Dusk Falls,"Uninstalled, horrible art style, horrible performance."
As Dusk Falls,Zero gameplay and IGN gives to this movie a 9?....
As Dusk Falls,"Not that great as IGN says, 76% on metacritic."
As Dusk Falls,I'm enjoying this a lot
As Dusk Falls,Such a terrible game. We're in 2022 and you don't have any resolutions higher than 1080p? LOL wow.
As Dusk Falls,wow this boring looks boring AF. rather just watch a cool movie
As Dusk Falls,not happy with the game. thought it would’ve been like the quarry where you can have at least 2 players playing and divide the 8 characters. It has to be 8 people playing
As Dusk Falls,Only ponys cry about that game and hating it. if it is a Sony exclusive it's Goty for them and they would say xbox has no games.
As Dusk Falls,10/10 perfect game perfect stories
As Dusk Falls,Damn Diana really out here strugglin after taking down Providence from the inside:/
As Dusk Falls,How tf is a game all about pictures 68 gb
As Dusk Falls,Anyone having trouble joining/having friends join a multiplayer game ? If so how do you fix it
As Dusk Falls,So it plays like a Sega CD FMV game?
As Dusk Falls,The games aesthetic reminds me of  a scanner darkly
As Dusk Falls,Looks like s*it 4 people that don’t like video games
As Dusk Falls,"Hidden gem! Surprised me so much, need more games like this on Game pass"
As Dusk Falls,Anyone have an issue with joining a friends game?
As Dusk Falls,I'm sure Vince never asked for this....
As Dusk Falls,Do you even play? Or is it just a bunch of cutscenes
As Dusk Falls,"Oh great yet another shitty interactive movie that people stupidly call a ""video game"""
As Dusk Falls,A Scanner Darkly the game
As Dusk Falls,This game is dope so far
As Dusk Falls,Nice job by an Xbox studio
As Dusk Falls,THANKS
As Dusk Falls,NICE WORK
As Dusk Falls,"Getting chased by a dog, hilarious, as in joke of a game"
As Dusk Falls,Great game!
As Dusk Falls,Looking forward to this and the multiplayer option
As Dusk Falls,telltales ripoff with no imagination.
As Dusk Falls,This game is the concept art phase of game development. If you want a fully developed game with diverging paths in story go play Detroid: Become Human
As Dusk Falls,"So considering all this, when I played through the game I generally had a positive opinion on it. Sure the animation style is really bazar and the previous issues were pretty obvious but other than that there’s nothing exceptional about it, so it was pretty much just an ok little thing in my opinion."
As Dusk Falls,"As a long fan of this type of game it’s tricky to have a impartial view of them because the way how they are designed means that judging the story is basically not an option, and judging the writing and voice acting isn’t exactly fair since the people making the game have to write and voice several different versions of the same lines and their results multiple times for every interaction."
As Dusk Falls,Team Gamepass 4life !!
As Dusk Falls,"Disagree with basically everything in this review, I didn't mind the visual style but don't think it added that much more than normal animation, but the story and acting and choices were absolutely phenomenal"
As Dusk Falls,Guess i could try it on cloud.
As Dusk Falls,Interesting. Both IGN and Gamespot reckoned it was pretty good. I don't see it though and here's a review closer to what I was expecting from the game. I wonder which is closer to correct.
As Dusk Falls,Thanks for playing Marty 🙏 I know it's always a bummer when the writing doesn't cut it. I hope you get to review something more fun and interesting next. Cheers man 🍻
As Dusk Falls,you wanna spend 30 bucks on a game this week? buy stray
As Dusk Falls,"A death blow to games like this is not making your characters interesting enough. No matter what else you do to pretty it up, if you fail at that, it's over."
As Dusk Falls,Sounds like it was pretty typical then.
As Dusk Falls,"I feel kinda overwhelmed with games like this, so many options, must could have or not a huge impact to the story, but i'm that kinda of person that plays once and does not go back to see every decision and every ending. (only if i had a terrible terrible ending)"
As Dusk Falls,"Damn. The whole benefit of taking out standard mechanics of Telltale/Quantic games is that it frees up your resources to focus wholly and solely on your characters, writing, and visuals - and reducing the visuals to a part-motion graphic novel style is that it gets the visuals out of the way of the storytelling. Going to all those lengths to centre the characters and storytelling and then GETTING IT WRONG is a maddening failure; it begs the question of whether or not they even knew the writing was poor as they made it."
As Dusk Falls,Multiplayer with voting and vetos is a great idea. Many narrative games could do that (or even add that after release) with comparatively little work.
As Dusk Falls,Was waiting on your review
As Dusk Falls,I’m interested to try this game but the aesthetics are such an add choice.  It looks like a concept storyboard.
As Dusk Falls,"Thank you for the review. I'm a fan of this type of game, but I decided to wait for a sale for this game."
As Dusk Falls,"That 8 player mode seems really neat, like it could be fleshed out into a full game."
As Dusk Falls,Naw i was skeptical at first.. finished it..story was🔥🔥🔥🔥
As Dusk Falls,Great review. 999 and VLR being mentioned utterly thrilled me!
As Dusk Falls,Team Gamepass 4life !!
As Dusk Falls,Game was alright but very disappointing in that it just ended and left me wanting more!! Not at all recommended for the price! I have gamepass so it's ok but I wouldn't pay more than $10 for it.
As Dusk Falls,"Thank you for the review. I'm a fan of this type of game, but I decided to wait for a sale for this game."
As Dusk Falls,what a shame was hoping this would be better
As Dusk Falls,"That 8 player mode seems really neat, like it could be fleshed out into a full game."
As Dusk Falls,"Disagree with basically everything in this review, I didn't mind the visual style but don't think it added that much more than normal animation, but the story and acting and choices were absolutely phenomenal"
As Dusk Falls,It also has a companion app
As Dusk Falls,29.99 too expensive for this crap imho
As Dusk Falls,"0:47 Eugh that pulsing is extremely unpleasant..
Interesting approach to this sort of game, but I've gotta say I don't really know why they did the visuals this way. There doesn't appear to be any actual reason for it, other than to save money on animations or cover up for poor acting, I suppose. The cross-platform multiplayer stuff is really nice though."
As Dusk Falls,"As a long fan of this type of game it’s tricky to have a impartial view of them because the way how they are designed means that judging the story is basically not an option, and judging the writing and voice acting isn’t exactly fair since the people making the game have to write and voice several different versions of the same lines and their results multiple times for every interaction.

So considering all this, when I played through the game I generally had a positive opinion on it. Sure the animation style is really bazar and the previous issues were pretty obvious but other than that there’s nothing exceptional about it, so it was pretty much just an ok little thing in my opinion."

As Dusk Falls,Naw i was skeptical at first.. finished it..story was🔥🔥🔥🔥
As Dusk Falls,i thought it gon be like Heavy Rain but what is this slideshow shit!
As Dusk Falls,Marty Silva? From ign
As Dusk Falls,basically a powerpoint lol
As Dusk Falls,This game is the concept art phase of game development. If you want a fully developed game with diverging paths in story go play Detroid: Become Human.
As Dusk Falls,"That sux, i was lookong forward to it"
As Dusk Falls,Guess i could try it on cloud.
As Dusk Falls,The PC port is just bad. Are you telling me in 2022 we can't get higher resolutions on a PC port greater than 1080p? Laughable.
As Dusk Falls,you wanna spend 30 bucks on a game this week? buy stray
As Dusk Falls,pretentious  ass game droped it after 1 hour
As Dusk Falls,"Does anyone know how to fix multiplayer ? Friend cannot join lobby, playing on Xbox"
As Dusk Falls,"Damn.

As Dusk Falls,Anyone having an issue with joining a friends game?
As Dusk Falls,"I heard Supermassive got bought recently, I just didn't realize they were bought by Wish"
As Dusk Falls,"If I want a slideshow, I’ll go to powerpoint. No thanks"
As Dusk Falls,The size of this game baffles me.
As Dusk Falls,Its shit
As Dusk Falls,Great review. 999 and VLR being mentioned utterly thrilled me!
As Dusk Falls,Thanks for playing Marty 🙏 I know it's always a bummer when the writing doesn't cut it. I hope you get to review something more fun and interesting next. Cheers man 🍻
As Dusk Falls,How on earth does this take up 51gb of storage lmao. Is it all moving images? We had these in the 2000s. They were called Flash games.
As Dusk Falls,"A death blow to games like this is not making your characters interesting enough. No matter what else you do to pretty it up, if you fail at that, it's over."
As Dusk Falls,How tf is this 70gb ?
As Dusk Falls,Glad to know I can skip this one without fomo... I grilled it with the chat when it was revealed live. Not my cup of tea.
As Dusk Falls,"Honestly... I think the art style would have worked better with still scenes and clear black outline á la cartoon or comic book style. Because I sorta  got flashbacks to Max Payne (the original). Like there is nothing inherently wrong with trying to make things like this. Interactive stories can work, but I think they can't be or shouldn't be sold as games. Like... I wouldn't mind a ""netflix"" of interactive stories like this. It could actually work! Choose where these scenes go, and enjoy few of them during your tea break at work! Like I do watch netflix at work during brakes! Why not a story I can choose, with a nice art style!?"
As Dusk Falls,Worst game I’ve seen in my life
As Dusk Falls,Why is it locked at 30 and 1080p wtf
As Dusk Falls,I’m interested to try this game but the aesthetics are such an add choice.  It looks like a concept storyboard.
As Dusk Falls,"The art style definitely reminds me of the excellent ""A Scanner Darkly"", great call on that. The branching storyline maps seem straight out of the David Cage game implementation guide too, a good feature to steal!"
As Dusk Falls,Sounds like it was pretty typical then.
As Dusk Falls,Interesting. Both IGN and Gamespot reckoned it was pretty good. I don't see it though and here's a review closer to what I was expecting from the game. I wonder which is closer to correct.
As Dusk Falls,"That is, without a doubt, the fuckin worst name for a game I've ever heard. 

Seriously who names their game after a generic metalcore band from 2004."
As Dusk Falls,"Ah perfect, youtube is saying there are one comment 
while I see 5 different comments"
As Dusk Falls,"That’s the animation style?
For a minute, I thought the game was just ‘pausing’ itself as the player makes choices.  This feels a bit lazy.  I guess you could get used to it…but I feel I would just stay annoyed.  I dunno."
As Dusk Falls,2:49 ??? That made no sense.
As Dusk Falls,Was waiting on your review
Little Nightmares II,Thanks for a bunch of spoilers
Little Nightmares II,7/10????????? WTF
Little Nightmares II,"This game is a gem,  felt like Tim Burton stylized interactive movie hope they make the 3rd one and make the game length longer, its a 9 from me"
Little Nightmares II,Give it a 10/10 this game is so beautiful and great
Little Nightmares II,"Whoever review this, this man need to be fired"
Little Nightmares II,This game was a masterpiece!
Little Nightmares II,the game deserves more than 7. at least 10 masterpiece
Little Nightmares II,"Lore wise, people ignore six on purpose"
Little Nightmares II,Not very smart person below me👇😂
Little Nightmares II,"Love the cry baby’s in the comments whining about a review score like it’s the end all be all of their precious little video game, kinda like the obsessed media driven enemies in the game lol."
Little Nightmares II,This guy has to go.
Little Nightmares II,A 7?! This reviewer should be punished severely by 200 lashes. This game is at least 9. Unforgettable experience.
Little Nightmares II,And The Suffer Made ( Little Nightmare 3 );
Little Nightmares II,"Ign really can't be trusted, giving this anything other than a 10 should be a crime"
Little Nightmares II,It’s like no one is acknowledging the bad the camera angles that make easy parts very hard.
Little Nightmares II,I'm here after seeing that IGN gave Horizon FW a 9 lol
Little Nightmares II,"They didn’t even Mention the story, the themes, and everything that makes this game What should’ve been game of the year"
Little Nightmares II,"IGN have given similar reviews to Alien isolation, a master piece of sega"
Little Nightmares II,These are the same people that made every  Call of duty a 9/10  and you say it's repetitive! Tell me how that works!
Little Nightmares II,A 7/10? Na that's cap!
Little Nightmares II,HE HID THE DISLIKES
Little Nightmares II,Greates Game of all Time 10/10
Little Nightmares II,IGN giving 7 was the real Nightmare 🤦
Little Nightmares II,just finished the game.. this guy should be fired immediately
Little Nightmares II,7 really ? IGN lost it's mind. This game deserve atleast 9.
Little Nightmares II,Wow. Ign is very out of touch
Little Nightmares II,Superb game and story
Little Nightmares II,This game is a 4....
Little Nightmares II,00:17 actually it's a prequel
Little Nightmares II,You misspelled 10/10
Little Nightmares II,meanwhile Call of Duty keeps rehashing its same exact formula and IGN keeps giving them better scores.
Little Nightmares II,just finished this today and 7/10 is bad review this is one of the best games i've played better than the ones they scored 8/10 or 9/10 lol
Little Nightmares II,delete ur channel now its irrelevant now
Little Nightmares II,wtf happened to ign smh
Little Nightmares II,Do this game a service and remember (everyone) to leave this review a thumbs down.
Little Nightmares II,"Just finished the game 100%, definite 9/10 and possible GOTY for me."
Little Nightmares II,"""Six's role is that of a more proactive version of yoda from eco"" what does he mean by this? Anyone?"
Little Nightmares II,Tool would be the perfect soundtrack for this game.
Little Nightmares II,Well this is a garbage review lol
Little Nightmares II,"this guy should not be reviewing games, like, ever"
Little Nightmares II,"This game is a masterpiece, I’m currently playing this on the ps5 and can’t stop playing it….

8.5/10"
Little Nightmares II,This deserves even more dislikes
Little Nightmares II,7! Wtf! Way too low!
Little Nightmares II,Wtf
Little Nightmares II,Agree with this review although I'd give a 6/10.
Little Nightmares II,This guy probably gives call of duty games 10/10
Little Nightmares II,"""We would've given the game a 10/10, but it doesn't have guns and battle royale, so we're gonna give it a 7"""
Little Nightmares II,"Dumbf*ck reviewer: ""The game plays it safe""
The game: cannibalism, infanticide and motherf*cking time loops"
Little Nightmares II,"Little nightmares 1 and 2 were both amazing games

IGN. WHAT ?"
Little Nightmares II,Over-rated - clunky and tiresome gameplay
Little Nightmares II,"It's supposed to be a review not a spoiler cast. So, please stop sharing all the cool moments."
Little Nightmares II,"This A-hole says tht LT2 is reusing mechanics of LT1 
But in his own review he says that the game has added new things like using torch in one level to evade some enemies or killing smaller enemies with weapons
Wht the phack he is upto"
Little Nightmares II,"Six ain’t Caught cause it’s Mono they’re After


Spoiler:




He’s the thin man

Edit: sorry spelling mistake"
Little Nightmares II,7 whats wrong with you
Little Nightmares II,Wrong >:(
Little Nightmares II,This review is a joke
Little Nightmares II,Ign: noooooo why is the game not completely different waaaaaa
Little Nightmares II,Just finished this game and have no idea what game this guy was playing to give it a 7/10.
Little Nightmares II,"If Mono can still uses Hunter's shotgun through the end of game, IGN will give it 9/10"
Little Nightmares II,Would you get LIttle Nightmares 1 or 2? Never played either. Both look fun.
Little Nightmares II,"Played the game and is my 3rd favorite game, up there with a hat in time and minecraft. The bosses were terrifying. Game was surprisingly difficult but that makes it better. And dont even get me started on visuals, plot, music and atmosphere. fairly rating it, the game gets an 8.86 out of 10. Personal enjoyment would be a 9.7 out of 10. Recommend the game."
Little Nightmares II,Who made this guy review this? Don’t listen to this guy. This game is a masterpiece. Buy it. This dude is just the wrong person. Go enjoy the game.
Little Nightmares II,"Im in loss for words
You give new CoD games (that are probably mostly the same as the last) 9/10 or something like that 
But this masterpiece of a game a 7/10 for being to similar to the first? Wow"
Little Nightmares II,Just completed little nightmare 2. This game is masterpiece. 0/10 to this review 👎
Little Nightmares II,What is the background music used in the first  part of the review?
Little Nightmares II,Sadly we will probably didn't get a Sequel from Tarsier Studios.
Little Nightmares II,"Watch Gameranx's review instead of this, there are no spoilers in that one"
Little Nightmares II,"F you ign you never in reality
Cyberbug 1998 : 9
an awasome game the name is little nighmares 2 : 7?
Wtf you think about us?"
Little Nightmares II,"Gotta love how this dude says LN2 reuses to many element, yet when call of duty 5000 is released and everything is reused there isn't a single mention of it, like is ign need of special care"
Little Nightmares II,*That ending traumatized me hard.*
Little Nightmares II,he said it took place after the first game this guy makes me laugh so this shows us that he has never played little nightmares 1 or 2 at all but you gotta love how he looked up little nightmare 2 bugs. and cyber punk is a 0 out of 10
Little Nightmares II,Its really a 9 -10
Little Nightmares II,Awfull review
Little Nightmares II,Games are always going to have glitches and there are even going to more glitches when you do things developers didn’t expect you to do
Little Nightmares II,"It would’ve been cool if it were 2 player!
Either way, I’m definitely buying this game. The first one was absolutely amazing!"
Little Nightmares II,"Hi I’m the guy that gives you an actual review! That gives you the real information!

Graphics: 9/10
Music: 8/10
Different to the last game: 7/10
Story: 9/10
Ending: 9/10
Fun to play: 10/10


Verdict: 9/10"
Little Nightmares II,Opinion is opinion but the guy really seems like he didn't even play the game.
Little Nightmares II,Just picked up the game today. Looks like a fun game.
Little Nightmares II,A FOKING 7 ?!?!?!?!??!?
Little Nightmares II,How ridiculous. This game was a masterpiece! Got me emotional at the end with literally no dialogue through the whole game. Just powerful storytelling by creative people!
Little Nightmares II,"this? this video was SUCH an insult to the game's beauty, please, a 7???"
Little Nightmares II,One of the best endings ever
Little Nightmares II,"NOT AS MUCH AS A IMPACT AS THE FIRST ONE 7/10 WHAT THE HECK THIS GUY IS A TOTAL JOKE?!
JUST BECAUSE THERE WASNT GUNS IN IT DOESNT MEAN ITS HORRIBLE!"
Little Nightmares II,"This artistry and creativity behind this game is wayyyy understated by this review, which was incredibly 1 dimensional"
Little Nightmares II,"I'm not trying to be rude but has anyone actually seen an IGN review in recent history that doesn't come off as superficial? It's almost as if the critics aren't actual gamers, they seem detached from what we look for in games and consistently miss the point of what a review is supposed to be. :("
Little Nightmares II,Sidescroller? No thanks
Little Nightmares II,Yo what does this dood mean ps2 classic????
Little Nightmares II,Stick to reviewing racing games you moron
Little Nightmares II,fire this guy immediately!
Little Nightmares II,Where is  the guy who reviewed the little nightmare?
Little Nightmares II,Sooo more indie garbagee got it
Little Nightmares II,Alien Isolation review flashback
Little Nightmares II,The 1 one was great this is even better honestly
Little Nightmares II,Whoever made this review doesn't seem to have actually played the game
Little Nightmares II,Should have been a 9. The game has its issues and glitches but some of those are for the sake of the art design. Still one of the best horror games I’ve played in a long time.
Little Nightmares II,"Why would you complain about being bad at the game while skip over the stunning visuals, compelling story, great ambience, AMAZING SOUNDTRACK and overreaching characters 





































But that’s ign"
Little Nightmares II,This game was amazing tbh. If only it was longer 😭
Little Nightmares II,He completely left out the fact that mono could change the transmission. All he said was that he could pick up weapons and six helped him.
Little Nightmares II,"Cyberpunk: A glitchy mess. 9/10
Little nightmares 2: A beautiful game with amazing sound design that is scary without jump scares. 7/10"
Little Nightmares II,You guy gave cyberpunk 9 dude u guys are biased douches
Little Nightmares II,"Thanks for the review, gameranx! We wanted to mention that the audio-only puzzle you pointed out actually does already have two visual cues that will help you solve it if you don't have sound or are hearing impaired - there's a visual effect when you are close to the correct solution and another visual effect that you see after you've picked the wrong solution. We hope this helps!"
Little Nightmares II,LN1 and 2 are both gems in the horror and puzzle genre. really incredible games and works of art that will stand the test of time. truly inspired art direction and level design
Little Nightmares II,I much prefer the prequel for some reason
Little Nightmares II,Wish I watched this before buying. The combat made me rage quit and delete the game. F**k the combat they gave. It’s awful and it makes it less scary if I can actually fight back.
Little Nightmares II,Hello thank you for the video...I have the little nightmare Delux version on switch...But I don't see how to download the DLC? Is it possible to download the dlc on switch? and or ? Thank you very much I'm lost
Little Nightmares II,"I freaking LOVED this game! What a fun, unique, and super creative experience. This game brought me soooooo much joy i cant wait to platinum it!! God i hope they make a third one 🤞"
Little Nightmares II,"This game is incredible. Even better than the first one. Super simple in terms of gameplay, but the story is surprisingly complex for something without dialogue or big cutscenes."
Little Nightmares II,"just grabbed Little Nightmares II for the PS5 for $10...
and the first Little Nightmares for free."
Little Nightmares II,"One the greatest games 🌟⭐️
The ending was 🤯"
Little Nightmares II,"Its a fine game ,but not a master piece as the 1st ."
Little Nightmares II,i still think this game is highly overrated
Little Nightmares II,Thanks so much I’m considering buyin it on switch as it’s reduced to 15 bucks I played the first little nightmares but didn’t get to finish it so I wanted to know if I have to do that before this
Little Nightmares II,I didn't buy the first game cause the demo was too easy. Is this one harder?
Little Nightmares II,Is it harder than the 1st one?
Little Nightmares II,"I am the thousandth comment.  That's a flat 1000 people.   As I sus out whether to buy this game or not.   Just a flat, even, clean thousand comments.  The alpha and the omega.  Nobody fuck it up now.  I take'th this throne with heaviest burden...

I shall...buy...the game....yes.  yes I shall. 

(Taking a dump, go away)"
Little Nightmares II,"After Completing both games I can say that it is a 10/10 experience with the first game being a little bit finicky but for me that didn't disrupt my playthrough and actually made it feel more challenging, But Little Nightmares 2 is far more improved upon, the visuals, sound design, story and even the controls have been improved drastically. Both games are 10/10 if I had to choose 1 it would Be Little Nightmares 2 but still I recommend playing both games, don't let price deter you!"
Little Nightmares II,"after playing it for the first time yesterday and finishing it in one playthrough, this review is spot on. I am so glad I got to experience this masterpiece. I'm in love with this game now.

Fuck IGN""s shit ""review"", that was a spoiler and complaining fest."
Little Nightmares II,"This is going to be my next purchase, I loved the first one, the DLC a bit less but still good. And Little Nightmares 2 seems very promising, and I love the fact that Six is there and the interactions between the two characters l look great"
Little Nightmares II,"The bully combat was tough until I got aggressive. Stopped waiting for them and trying to time my hits, just rushed them and smashed them all in. Worked way better."
Little Nightmares II,Why is it not co op in PS5?
Little Nightmares II,The first one was satisfying this one should be better I didn't like the dlc for the first game tho even tho it adds up
Little Nightmares II,"my first acid trip i was playing little nightmares on the ps4. the trip started to kick in while I was trying to use the mirror on that japanese lady. I actually lost track of what I was doing and actually ended up dropping my controller and smoked out of my cart to calm me down. After a while the trip intensified a lot, I kept feeling like I was in the belly of some monster, a pink colored ominous purple belly and the sounds from the game were still going on too so I really started to loose track of stuff. I then started to get anxious cause it was 6 am and the trip still didnt die down and I started sweating and taking off my cloths looking at the time. But the whole time idek why I felt like I was in the belly of something. I havent fully recovered from the trip to this date, and i cant look at the insides of peoples mouths ever again without getting flashbacks to the pink color belly of the beast I was in."
Little Nightmares II,Nice ! Thanks for the video really helped a lor
Little Nightmares II,I already both it
Little Nightmares II,Worth £17?
Little Nightmares II,After so many years this game is the first game that frustrates me with control and mechanics and i experience so many cheap deaths and get mad instead of enjoying the game.
Little Nightmares II,"I’ve just started playing this game today on my Nintendo Switch OLED and I’m bloody impressed so far. I haven’t got to far into it but from what I’ve already played I’ve really enjoyed, from the music to the gameplay. The character models can definitely make you feel uneasy when sneaking through a level!"
Little Nightmares II,I didn't play the first one but bought the second one today hoping it wouldn't effect the game play haha thanks I still have no idea what the orginal story line is but so far perfect for spooky month deff over priced I payed almost 40 bucks for it but it is really interesting! I've seen many play it and I'm glad I got it. I was bored after finishing spirit of the north and this is really different but the puzzles are nice!
Little Nightmares II,"For anyone wanting to buy for enhanced editions its currently on Amazon in UK and Europe for £17.04 for the 'Day One Edition' brand new, worth every penny, it looks stunning anyway but on the PS5 (And XBSX/S I'm sure, I know they are patching rtx) this game looks incredible, there is an area with rain drops and if you want to show your friends your new consoles abilities put this on."
Little Nightmares II,"I'd wait until it gets on sale. 25 euros is way too overpriced for a 5 hour game. Overall pretty disappointing. The very trial and error nature of the game keeps getting in the way of the amazing atmosphere. Feels super outdated, the 3D platforming doesn't work with that 2D camera angle. More frustrating than anything else, which is a pitty since there's some much potential for greatness here."
Little Nightmares II,“some” trial and error. “SOME”
Little Nightmares II,"ive gotten every achievement in both games yes including hard to the core, and i loved little nightmares 1 wholeheartedly but 2 seemed off and kinda gross to me the AI six solved most of the harder twin puzzles and made the game more action and jumpscareish which i praised the first game for not having, being eerie and creepy making everything feel off without needing to throw cheap scares out. On top of that i felt they made the monsters first while the first feels they made the setting and the nightmares to fit that setting as why would there be a hospital right next to the school and, oh kids are scared of two things out in life, school and medical people. it got so much praise from critics but my favorite part was the final chapter and then the end pissed me off, six changes moods twice in the 2nd game and they are strong mood swings both are different than how she is in the first game, and unless you get a walkthrough or miraculously waltz into all the off screen secret places you wont get the secret 10 second scene trying to justify the ending and explain the weird actings... it just felt weird the polish on the game though and sound design were well worth the praise i felt the story though fell flat for me, and the first will always be better in my opinion"
Little Nightmares II,Is this game fun i never played the first one?
Little Nightmares II,Little Nightmares was much more intense because of no trial and error. Trial and error actually made many great moments feel not scary at all. Whereas Part 1 really was memorable because of the one-go chases.
Little Nightmares II,7:27 in this part of the game. I didn’t know you had to bolt out of the class
Little Nightmares II,Cost me like 8$ for both of them on steam and I'm loving #1 started out playing 2nd one and thought I want to play the 1st one then play the second but 1st game can drag a little but I really enjoy it
Little Nightmares II,"Other than the absolutely infuriating sledgehammer sections, the game is very enjoyable."
Little Nightmares II,i played the first one and today i am going to get it
Little Nightmares II,Can you couch co op
Little Nightmares II,"Controls are annoying and kinda floaty, but the visuals and sound design 100% make up for it. Lots of trial and error and a couple of cheap deaths, but still recommended for the incredible atmosphere."
Little Nightmares II,This looks like it has the visual aesthetic and eery atmosphere of Coraline.
Little Nightmares II,I wish they'd do a co-op like this!  I love this game!
Little Nightmares II,Limbo meets Ico!?
Little Nightmares II,This game was really nice good puzzles
Little Nightmares II,My Ex is playing this game so I got it as well😔
Little Nightmares II,I’ve never even played the first one and I’m wondering is this game fun? Or good?
Little Nightmares II,"thank you for mentioning accessibility stuff, its so important to mention for a lot of people."
Little Nightmares II,"I've played the game, buy it"
Little Nightmares II,i never played the original but i played this one im seriously considering getting it
Little Nightmares II,Sometimes I just like watching before you buy videos after I’ve already bought and finished the game
Little Nightmares II,"I actually only recently played and beat Little Nightmares for the first time. I must admit, it did suck me in and I definitely want to explore the second game before my youtube recommendations inevitably spoil parts of the game."
Little Nightmares II,"That god damned teacher, especially later D:"
Little Nightmares II,I’m obsessed We stumbled across this the other day and we are so excited to start playing today we’re going to start with the very first one little nightmare and then obviously nightmare 2 I just hope they come out with a third one I wish it was longer but this is absolutely a phenomenal game
Little Nightmares II,"I’m thinking of buying this game but got a bit confused when I searched it and saw there was a Complete Edition and then of course, Little Nightmares 2. What’s the complete edition?"
Little Nightmares II,I’ve just brought Little Nightmares II for my Nintendo Switch after hearing really good things about this game. I’ve recently just jumped back into gaming and I’m glad this is going to be my first experience back. The Horror mixed with some charm looks to be a fantastic concept! Excellent Review as well!
Little Nightmares II,"This game us just a 10/10 so just buy it, it’s so amazing"
Little Nightmares II,Games like this recapture the essence of old school gaming. 1 hour into AC Valhalla I uninstalled. Indie greater than Triple A. Games fantastic
Little Nightmares II,"""this game is not scream out loud""
When the teacher was squeezing her head through the vent and the thin man was chasing me through the train yard had me screaming like a girl lmao"
Little Nightmares II,This game is so amazing that at the end of the game your mouth will left wide open!!!
Little Nightmares II,"Played both games and really enjoyed both. I highly relate to the bits where near perfection in timing seems needed to advance, but overall - and even though the games are relatively short in game time - they were both fantastic. And it cannot be emphasized enough that Tobias Lilja really blew the roof off with the music. I'd buy both again in a heartbeat."
Little Nightmares II,First game was shorter it was one in a half hours to 2 hours long
Little Nightmares II,The worst con of this game is that one of the main characters is a bastard
Little Nightmares II,Is the deluxe version worth it?
Little Nightmares II,I just played the demo....I like it! I think I will buy the game.
Little Nightmares II,See my gaming channel on ghost of tsushima gameplay playthrough what just started playing on my YouTube gaming channel
Little Nightmares II,"I loved Little Nightmares II, though I still prefer the original. Something about it feels more intimate."
Little Nightmares II,"Before you buy , wait till the dlcs release to get a full game ."
Little Nightmares II,Let me just say this game blew my mind.  It's the prequel to the first game and the ending is absolutely insane.  10/10
Little Nightmares II,Can yall do a before you buy on the stubb's the zombie remake on ps4? Only like two people have talked about it and the $20 price tag is a bit steep for what it is so I'm kinda reluctant to buy it.
Little Nightmares II,"I was so hype for 2, was about to preorder but saw the full gameplay. Not worth 60."
Little Nightmares II,What’s your recommendation for minimum age?
Little Nightmares II,3:55 is that the hat of the first protagonist?!
Little Nightmares II,"Can you believe the TMZ of gaming journalism, IGN, gave this game a 7/10. But they gave CYBERPUNK a 9/10. Like what are these people smoking?"
Little Nightmares II,It's just indy garbage
Little Nightmares II,I’m only 2 hours in and this slipped under the radar for me. But I had to see if my boys at GameRanx agreed with me on how incredible this was/is! Can’t wait to see how it ends.
Little Nightmares II,Can you review new Harvest Moon games coming out?! Can you compare Harvest Moon One World vs Story of Seasons Pioneers of Olive Town!? Please! I trust your reviews :)
Little Nightmares II,"today i uninstalled COD cold war because it was too frustrating, too many head glitching spots on the map and i couldnt just take it so i decided to play this instead and my is it worth it, this is what a game should make you feel, the thrill and everything its worth the money,thyank for reminding me what gaming is all about BANDAI NAMCO"
Little Nightmares II,Please Do before you buy for new Pokémon snap
Little Nightmares II,Little nightmares and little nightmares 2 is my first games ever and I loved them. Any suggestions for what I should try next that would be similar?
Little Nightmares II,"Just here to say that the trial and error can definitely piss you off if you add the clunkiness factor to it. Over and over again I had parts where I understood what I had to do, but if I didn't get the timing and placement of the character 100% perfectly right because there was a small rock/toy/piece of whatever in the way or if the depth of the platform was hard to see, there just wasn't a way I could succeed. Watching the character die over and over again and seeing the big bad thing chase me so many times, stopped them from being scary or fun to me pretty soon. Every time there was jumping or I had to dangle from things, there was almost no way you could manage to get that perfect placement of everything on the first go, and some times you have to do it again because maybe the character didn't grab that ledge on the first try. So, sometimes this game is hard, but in a way that stops the story and forces you to do stuff over and over again. Glad there were many savepoints but the repetition definitely exhausted me."
Little Nightmares II,Anyone else just come to watch reviews... Just cause?.. or zit just me? 🤷🏻‍♂️
Little Nightmares II,I dont even buy games but i still need your guidance i mean its pretty understandable to buy multiplayer games but singleplayer offline games? Nuh uh
Little Nightmares II,"DUDE you got a reply from BANDAI WTF

also thanks for always playing the games for us so we dont waste our money (but in this particular case, would *not* be a waste)!"
Little Nightmares II,i love chases in little nightmares 2 it just make me get goosebumbs
Little Nightmares II,Who's watching this after finishing the game
Little Nightmares II,I couldn't find this game anywhere. People are selling it for $60-70 on ebay/Amazon. I checked Best Buy again yesterday and it said *one left in stock* for $40 and I clicked my money away.
Little Nightmares II,"As much as I love original LN game I've not enjoyed this one at all! Gameplay is a massive let down, annoying and inconsistent, game puts you in to the box and you have to follow the script to the T, any creativity will be punished."
Little Nightmares II,"before you buy videos: exist
me who literally download everything for free:
i'm gonna pretend i didnt see that"
Little Nightmares II,I just played the demo and it was very fun but I don't know if it's worth buying. Do you think it would be worth it?
Little Nightmares II,Anyone have suggestions for switch games like the little nightmares ones?
Little Nightmares II,0:55 this is all you need boys
Little Nightmares II,"Little 
Nightmare is a crazy  game"
Little Nightmares II,"How could  six
Push  mono"
Little Nightmares II,Who else watches before you buy when the game is downloading
Little Nightmares II,"I just got the first one, is on 75% discount at the play station store at 8 dlls"
Little Nightmares II,The first one is $7 on the switch. Great game. Beautiful locations 😍😍😍✈️☀️
Little Nightmares II,Bruh to late I bought it
Little Nightmares II,"The Little Nightmares series, unlike games like slender, fnaf, outlast, resident evil etc, does not use its horror for the sake of scaring people. The horror in little nightmares is more like an art form, it thrives on motifs and build ups. Each scare in little nightmares is telling a story.

Little nightmares thrive at building scenes, which makes you appreciate the situations the main characters find themselves in. All great games does that. Ori did it, when you double jumped under the waterfall in moon grotto, or when you rushed to escape the water in the ginso tree. Stardew valley did it, when you wake up everyday to water the crops in the serenity of the early morning. Hollow night did it, when you first entered city of tears, or when you sat at the bench in queens gardens.

Little nightmares is a master at doing “it”. Whether or not it’s seeing lines of gluttonously obese and presumably very rich customers shambling onwards in a line as they boarded the ship in the distance; or sneaking around a monstrosity of a teacher as she indulges herself in an unsettling prelude on the piano. 

Little nightmares games are not the longest, but saying that it lowers it’s worth is kind of like saying juice with bigger litres are better, when sometimes they’re just watered down. I spent 80 bucks on resident evil, and honestly I’d rather have spent that money on little nightmares 3 and 4 if those every came out."
Little Nightmares II,I don’t think it’s as scary as the first one but I enjoyed it more because of the story
Little Nightmares II,That was very nice of you to make the point that people with hearing restraints may miss out on solving a puzzle. I hope that gets back to the devs.
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,Physical release?
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,Its a peice of art...even tough some of the boss battles are just too long.
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,Must. have. this.
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,It's not an homage on 50s Sci-Fi but rather 30s Sci-Fi (Flash Gorden & Buck Rogers). Why everyone says 50s? I don't know ...
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,I’ve been following this game for years now. I can’t believe it’s finally here!! And with no fanfare! My god!!
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,"Just picked up this genius game hell cheap, and I couldn't wipe off the stupid cheesy grin I had the whole way through the game, I'm absolutely enthralled with this Steller title, everything about it is absolutely awesome, but this game does one better over cuphead and I love that game to, go into accessibility options turn on your assists, and I'm getting hell good at this game, PS: a note to the team who made this, you guys n gals are absolute legends! Please do a sequel! Now if only cuphead had those accessibility options, I'm absolutely in love with this love letter to the past game"
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,Shmups need more style like this.
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,👍
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,"I’ve been playing this game the last few days and it’s one of those games that despite’s the flaws, makes you smile like an idiot while you play it."
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,"Squadron 51??!! Holy Bermuda Triangle, Batman!!👽🛸👍👍👍👍"
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,Looks great.  1950’s sci-fi movies are so much fun.
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,"Excited for this, looks incredible!"
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,Will this get a physical?
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,This looks sooo cool great style and amtosphere
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,Is this out now?
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,Ok I get this! Thanks for the review!!
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,"I saw the trailer for this a couple weeks back, looks super cool in concept. I love old school scifi."
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,Wow never heard of this but is definitely on the buy list ! Looks incredible
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,"Does this game have a ""Save Game"" feature or even a way to Pause it during interruptions? Or is it like on old cart game where you say ""I can't come to dinner, Mom. I'm in the middle of the game."" ? 😀"
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,"I just discovered this game on Steam and tried it. Fun as hell! Plays great to me but the intro cut scene has a voice stutter. Every so often, the narrator repeats himself.  I checked file integrity and it was ok so I tried reinstalling it and it still does it. Anyone else notice this? Is it part of the game? Suggestions?"
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,"Thanks for this review. Your insights led me to wishlists, and I just picked it up on switch. It plays well, and I was giggling at the live action cut scenes.  Thanks again"
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,"I saw this game on the steam storefront and was immediately intrigued. The visual design certainly grabs your attention. I'm glad it actually plays well and is worth the investment. Based on your review, I will definitely pick this game up. Thanks for the awesome content every week. Love this channel!"
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,"... sooo glad it is good.  I have been waiting a long time for this one :) reminds me of deadly tower of monsters .  Which I really dug...
Sine Mora turned out quite good, in spite of its crazy confusing story .."
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,"QotD: I'll tweak it slightly. Stylistically, I'll give it to the oft forgotten Boogie Wings, that's just amazing!"
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,"Seeing the thumbnail, kinda wondered what this was, I never really got into side scrolling shooters, but this looks interesting. As for the question, and this shows what little experience I have in them, but closest I could think of is Zaxxon, so I'll make that my answer."
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,"Man that looks freaky. I rewound the video to the beginning to look at the graphics more. 

Also noticed that the shots from the plane tilt when you change direction up or down. That's a cool effect I don't think I've seen before in a dedicated shooter.

QOTD, Want to say Pulstar on then neogeo."
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,"It probably doesn't answer your question correctly, since it's vertically scrolling, but I'm a big fan of ZeroRanger."
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,"1:10 - Um, Actually, that theme is from Stage 1 of Thunderforce II not III. hehe"
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,I'm in complete awe. This looks INCREDIBLE!
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,"The Deadly Tower of Monsters have similar premise ,you are playing main protagonist in old sci-fi movie set,it was pretty good,and have like ""post commentary"" through game,it was pretty funny.
Qotd;Since I'm the least familiar with shoot 'em ups, I've only played few for now. So I'll say Sine Mora Ex is my favourite side scrolling shooter."
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,"I was worried about Squad 51 but glad to see how it came out. Wishlisted.

U.N. Squadron."
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,"Nice!  Love shooters and the style, Will definitely buy!"
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,"Love the ""generic greenscreen explosion"" effects"
Night in the Woods,"Hey all! My review of Night in the Woods published last year, but we decided to do a video for the launch of the Switch version.

I hope you enjoy this game as much as I did! -Chloi"
Night in the Woods,They narratively fumbled the climactic final act. But the dialogue and setting are deeply compelling.
Night in the Woods,"Chloi Rad, super gamer and not journo who couldn't get a lefty political job"
Night in the Woods,"Wow she spoiled half of the game in spoiler free review, ign in its best form"
Night in the Woods,how are you gonna name 0 flaws but then give it 8.7
Night in the Woods,damn those crust punks
Night in the Woods,Is dialogue spoken or just text?
Night in the Woods,"This is one of the best reviews on IGN, why can't we get more people on here like this?!"
Night in the Woods,This game is an underrated Masterpiece
Night in the Woods,This game proves to be better than books.
Night in the Woods,Feels like I'm playing an actual chapter book.
Night in the Woods,"lolz @ 3:00 dialog, so lame"
Night in the Woods,What age is this game appropriate for?
Night in the Woods,"Sequel. When?

Edit: hopefully never"
Night in the Woods,This game is so messy it’s beautiful
Night in the Woods,This game really reminds me of pyukamuku.....
Night in the Woods,"Even though the art style is very beautiful I don’t understand why people are insane about the story, the dialog is so incredibly relative and awkward with overuse of words like “ugh” or “like” making it not fun to read. Plus the characters have almost no growth throughout this 7 hour game even though you had all that time to develop characters."
Night in the Woods,recently became free on steam and I played the game during times I feel bored or sad. It's great. The dream sequences are hard but I love Possum Springs so far. Now in Part 2
Night in the Woods,This game was sooooooooo boring
Night in the Woods,Why do I feel like this game is attacking me?
Night in the Woods,"This game is so beautiful, I will definitely play it some more when I got more time! I just wanted to play it for a hour for my video but got totally hooked haha"
Night in the Woods,"THIS IS A GREAT GAME!

Night in the Woods,IGN thinks night in the woods is worse than fortnite
Night in the Woods,It didn’t get a 100/10 I am disliking this video
Night in the Woods,This game is my favorite game of all time
Night in the Woods,"I want a second one, but I feel as though it would lose its original charm. Tell me what y’all think."
Night in the Woods,The perfect quarantine game. Had me reflect on my own early 20s
Night in the Woods,"Anyone here because it's on game pass?
 🙃😁"
Night in the Woods,"Honestly, Night in the Woods is my favorite Nintendo Switch game EVER. It touches and normalizes topics (in a light hearted way) that are considered taboo or too dark to discuss in every day conversation. I’ve replayed this game three times in the first month I’ve purchased it. Every time I replayed it, there was always something new to discover. The characters and environment is so incredibly enchanting. I HIGHLY recommend this game to E V E R Y O N E."
Night in the Woods,"This game made me bust out laughing, cry a few times, and forced me to think about my own situation."
Night in the Woods,Has to be one one of my fav games
Night in the Woods,This isn't even a review. You just spoil the game.
Night in the Woods,I bought this game because I liked the art style. I went in thinking it was some side scroller but then realized it’s an entirely different thing which I fell in love with. I relate so much to this game especially because I too flunked out and moved back home to find out things are different in my hometown. I will be thinking about this game for a long time.
Night in the Woods,Yeah.  New to pc games and this game seems little too long. Need to improve my attention span
Night in the Woods,Loadscreen in the woods. Great game tou
Night in the Woods,Just finished playing this in 2020. It's an awesome game. Don't miss it. (And this is a great review of it)
Night in the Woods,"It's a lovely game, however, because it's so short, why couldnt they leave in all the 3 exploring options (Historical Society, Park AND Graveyard)? Also, once i finished it, i was sad i couldnt go back and explore the town, or play the Demon Tower game or play my bass!"
Night in the Woods,"debating getting this while it's still on sale.
is it a fair comparison to say this is the ""bojack horseman of games""?"
Night in the Woods,K
Night in the Woods,"Played a lot of games during this long quarantine, and this one stuck out as one of the best. The passion and writing behind this narrative is something you don’t get very often. It reminded me of those children’s books from my childhood. Great game. Really hits you in the feels also"
Night in the Woods,"My only complaint for the game would be the dialogue. It was really cringey and unrealistic, as was the character development. Other than that, the art style, atmospheres, setting and pacing was alright."
Night in the Woods,It's rare that I ever play a game that has the ability to make me feel so many real emotions at once.
Night in the Woods,It’s only $12 on switch shop right now. I think I’ll try this for sure.
Night in the Woods,One of my favorite games ever
Night in the Woods,Personal game of the decade (2010s)
Night in the Woods,just finished it. its a real breath of fresh air.
Night in the Woods,"I’m sorry, but Bea is bae"
Night in the Woods,This game has ghosts now and will always be known for Zoe Quinn who got the developer killed!
Night in the Woods,"Just in case you forgot, ign gave evolve a 9/10"
Night in the Woods,"8.7. Yeah. And Undertale gets a 10.
Cause logic."
Night in the Woods,I really want a sequel
Night in the Woods,I am thinking about getting this game!! Now you made me REALLY want it. Asking my dad to get it for me! 😄
Night in the Woods,GREGG RULZ OK
Night in the Woods,You were wrong for what you did to Alec.
Night in the Woods,"I love how you have to play it more than once if you want all the achievements, it’s more worth the money that way because you don’t just play it once, there are different routes, rare achievements and once you start, it’s hard to stop"
Night in the Woods,"A fantastic game ruined by Zoe Quinn and her followers. I hope she rots in prison where she belongs.
Rest in peace, Alec."
Night in the Woods,*DED*
Night in the Woods,1:33 And a meme was born.
Night in the Woods,I'm disappointed that this review contains some pretty major plot spoilers. I'm about 5 hours into the game at the moment and this review tells me where the game is headed -  details that weren't obvious from what I've played of the game so far.
Night in the Woods,crap game
Night in the Woods,Pretty boring game for me
Night in the Woods,I just played this game and I loved it. It stirred genuine emotion out of me which is rare. A must have for any gamer or anyone that has felt a little lost in their life
Night in the Woods,Pleeease release a psychical edition! 10/10
Night in the Woods,I'm a bit confused about what you actually DO in the game.
Night in the Woods,"I’ve had my eyes on this game for a while, and I’m about to buy it but I don’t want to waste 20$. I need one more opinion on if I should get it or not."

Night in the Woods,This looks so interesting.
Night in the Woods,Best game ever made
Night in the Woods,Night in the woods makes you feel like Batman..

Night in the Woods,this was such an amazing video!! i'm always so incredibly happy to see someone pour so much time & effort into nitw.. it mustve taken forever to make but im so glad this love letter exists <3
Night in the Woods,Finji is thankfully creating a new game similar to Night In The Woods called Revenant Hill.
Night in the Woods,"What an excellent video you made! 
The story is well explained with detail and that's all I needed to remember it back because of how cool this video game was to contempleting, even though I wasn't good at understanding english before, a bit strange it didn't have translation but whatever. 
+1sub I wanna to see more of these bangers"
Night in the Woods,"I'm gonna say that first, this video is very well made.

But now I gotta hand out some criticism, the way you worded a lot of stuff regarding Mae and characters. Mae is suffering from multiple mental health problems (Dissociative disorder), which the game (from the start) makes very clear. She beat the shit out of a kid back in high school, she forgot about Bea's mom dying, she acts recklessly, she had a breakdown and went into a drunken rant, and she talks out of line because of her growing mental health issues. She saw her parents as negligent because she saw them not being at the train station for her and internalized it. Mae overall has A LOT of problems, but the game makes it clear that she still very much cares about everyone she knows. Hell, she went on a drunken rant because of her internal problems regarding an ex-partner (who was at the party) and how she views herself. Mae doesn't purposely go out of her way to make people's lives hard, or say things she never means to, she literally just isn't always able to process the situation and tone of everything. She canonically suffers from dissociative disorder.

Overall, I think you should've been a tad more respectful when going over Mae's behaviour in the game and should have been more open-minded about exactly WHAT was wrong with her. It seemed more like you were just throwing shade and not really taking into account how Mae is actually struggling as well, not just her friends and family."
Night in the Woods,"hold up, did you actually believe the cult??"
Night in the Woods,I really need to go back and replay it. Easily one of the best games ever!
Night in the Woods,"The characters just feel so real, and the first time i watched someone finish the game i cried. This was the only game to ever make me cry, because it felt like i was leaving real friends behind who i would never see again. And sure there’s fan comics and such, but those are never the same. The animations that people make are good, but there just aren’t that many. I was obsessed with this game a while ago and got back into it when saberspark played it and now I’m obsessed again. It’s quite literally hard to watch any other content on the internet because i want to see more of this game. They’re supposed to make a prequel and they said they knew what they wanted to do with a sequel, but wanted to make other games first, so i really hope they do make both of those. Eventually I’ll forget about it and get over it, but it’s hard to at first. It may not be my favorite game, but it definitely is up there. I’ve never played a game that made me love the characters so much, and i honestly just can’t explain why i love them so much."
Night in the Woods,"Wow that second guy at 1:10 looks pretty cool.

For real though, nice video. ""Life goes on, we should too"" has kind of become my mantra from this game. Glad you covered it in the way you did, pacing was great for a 1 hour video."
Night in the Woods,"I did not like the theory that they aren't anthropomorphic animals. Gives ""it was all a dream"" vibes. Worst kind of theory."
Night in the Woods,"So Possum Spings is one of those kept Net10 Dial-up in business into the late 00s, is in a dead zone for the major cell carriers, dying town climging to the past whilebthe past is taken out by the big megamart.
Mae is about 20-21 and Jesus in my see above the most unrealistic thing isn't ""my kid dropped out of college but shoot she's not quite right, and I'm still there for her"", or Gregg being a 20 year old ""teen"", Angus and Gregg not getting a lot of hate, or frankly shady goings on. The unrealistic parts are that it's a cult of an eldritch entity and not a politician, and the shady goings on have nothing to do with knowing how much Sudafed you can buy before getting flagged (well for 2017)."
Night in the Woods,"The cell phone thing is answered by the town not having any cell reception which gets pointed out but I dont remember exactly where.

Super small rust belt town"
Night in the Woods,"I’m gonna replay this now after watching this video. Now that I’ve turned 18 I feel like I can kinda relate to what Gregg is going through, and-I know this is gonna sound shitty-but I’m an asshole too. So hopefully I can learn something through Mae. I am currently an asshole trying my best to change that before I leave my home state to go to another for a job. A job with a ton of adults that I know are gonna be way more mature than me. Life is moving too fast and I need something I can just sit down and know won’t change. This game never changed for me. I always chose the same route and never thought about the story too hard. This video really put it into perspective for me, also it’s been ages since I’ve played this so it wouldn’t hurt to replay, especially now that I’m older. I feel like I can really relate to Gregg and Mae (wish I could relate to bea) I’m not ready to grow up but I also want to grow up. I wanna get a job and leave my hometown for good. I don’t wanna get stuck here but at the same time I don’t wanna leave. I’m not ready to be an adult because I’m emotionally not mature. I wanna do crimes, have fun, just be a rowdy teen. I don’t wanna be around adults because I’m kind of an asshole, an emotionally immature asshole, but I’m trying to change that and I hope I can before I leave on June 9th. I can leave my Midwest small town and go somewhere else and change. I hope I can grow up"
Night in the Woods,night in the woods has been my special interest since it came out so this title is very intriguing from a very biased standpoint haha
Night in the Woods,"When i played this game for the first time i just thought this game could get a sequel and expand on so many things and go in so many different directions and was hyped for the next game the team created then i found out one of rhe creators commited suicide and i got really sad i recently played it as a adult and i just think the speaks to me completely different than when i was younger this game is such a deep personal and human game i love it so much , very underrated"
Night in the Woods,It is really fascinating hearing someone enjoy one of my favorite games in a different way than me!
Night in the Woods,It's so hard to find content like this on my favorite game. NITW felt so impactful but it feels hardly anyone talks about it
Night in the Woods,"imma be real, i think mae has empathy problems. i do too, so i feel a connection to her."
Night in the Woods,"Man, when I got to part 4 of the game I was 100% freaking out. 
This game is one of the few that has made me cry, specially bea's story since I can relate to both characters in different ways."
Night in the Woods,"49:30 i think you went a little too hard with the whispering, hella uncomfortable with headphones. just let it play out..

otherwise great! you're good at pacing when reading your script, you don't rush important info and it flows very naturally"
Night in the Woods,"Great job! I have to call out your take on the ""adults"" in the game, though.  They are more than oblivious droning shells.  Mae's mom, Candy, doesn't attack her daughter with questions because she knows Mae's mental health issues. She tries to give her time and space to talk about it when she is ready. Eventually, if you bother to talk to her enough, Mom snaps on you. She explains that while she is hurt on a selfish/personal level that Mae left school, she understands how it feels to navigate personal challenges. Bea's dad isn't a flat out jerk either. He had a nervous breakdown after his wife died only 2 years ago. He never forced Bea to stay and help, she did that to herself and she knows it. She's just afraid of letting go. Pastor Kate and Mr. Chazokov provide spiritual and cosmological guidance that helps Mae to learn and define herself. The list goes on. One of the best things about this game is that none of the characters seem useless. Everyone has a purpose."
Night in the Woods,"This may not be seen but the statue in the first dream is likely the statue Mae talks about taunting her while at college and how it points, and how she sees it as 'just shapes'

This game is also my no. 1 fave game, Bea is def the best written tbh, but Gregg is my favourite character ever in all vieo game history just because of how much he resoluted to me, Bea did as well but gregg just hit a spot too close to home to just cry like normal, instead I break down violently. Bea acknowledged my fear of the future's struggles but Gregg's stories acknowledged my primal fears of the present and soon coming struggles as truly growing up comes so soon."
Night in the Woods,"Great video!  I relate so hard with Mae, she is for sure both someone I'd like to be and someone I've learned from in what not to do."
Night in the Woods,"10:40

Harsh disagree. This situation speaks to me because my mother is THE EXACT SAME WAY and i have never seen a representation of a mother like mine in media, mothers usually get depicted as misunderstanding, strict, rude or even violent, but my mom is the opposite of all those and im glad to finally see a story that hits home harder than anything

- sincerely, unemployed 20yo with careless infantile behaviours and neglect towards own safety who dropped out of college."
Night in the Woods,This game really needs a sequel
Night in the Woods,amazing. thank you for this essay on my favorite game of all time! it was beautiful/
Night in the Woods,amazing
Night in the Woods,"as a now 20 y/o i find myself resonating with this game years after i played it. It's story and it's characters are so fleshed out. i used to heavily dislike mae but i now see myself the most in her. this silly animal game highlights such profound parallels to real life, which hits so much closer to home :')"
Night in the Woods,"so in love with this long form content :) i look forward to seeing more in the future!,!!1"
Night in the Woods,"I really need to replay this game. I'm glad so many people are re-discovering this little masterpiece! I caught wind of it pretty early on with Woolie's playthrough on the old Best Friends channel and just had to buy and play it myself. It's been a few years though, and I'm a different person now. Maybe I'll see something new or two."
Night in the Woods,"I played this game in 2021 while sitting in my bedroom at night trying to cope with the pandemic and going to college on zoom in my hometown instead of a thousand miles away on the coast. I was 20, dealing with severe mental health issues, and one of my close friends had just gone missing. This game tore me open and I loved it for that"
Night in the Woods,mae dropped out of college because she has a mental illness that makes it ridiculously hard to DO school. of course her mom would be understanding and give her the time she needs to talk about it??? she might be an asshole but her reason for dropping out makes sense. so do her parents.
Night in the Woods,Beautiful video
Night in the Woods,"About Holowka: Benson and Hockenberry cut ties with him not because of ""some rumors"". He was a difficult person to work with, to put it mildly. It was the last straw.
Yes, he was a great artist, but not a great guy at all."
Night in the Woods,"After actually playing the game recently years after ive seen videos of it, not only was it as good as i remember, it's better than what I saw, being able to enjoy it yourself. Seeing the details and hidden interactions, the different paths, and especially understanding the premise more. Things really do change, and I've been seeing that, and I get it in NITW now.
Also so glad theres still interest in this game even after 5 years, really underrated video"
Night in the Woods,17:55 I think the statue in the first dream sequence is supposed to represent the statue at her college she mentions later in the game had scared her during one of her episodes.
Night in the Woods,love the video man
Night in the Woods,Ghost Grandpa Scene in the church is the best part of this game.
Night in the Woods,"17:51 First dream (nightmare?) is about boss in demontower, isnt it? I honestly thought thats because i played like 3-4 levels before sleep"
Night in the Woods,Subbed
Night in the Woods,This deserves more views
Night in the Woods,"Wow, this video is actually amazing. I'm genuinely blown away by the storytelling analysis you've shown on this game. I've played night in the woods quite a bit and it's good to know it means so much to somebody else aswell! /gen

Also I do believe the statue pointing it's finger at Mae in the dream sequence is a bit of foreshadowing towards Mae's confession on why she left college as she mentions later in the game, a similar pointing statue being ""just shapes"". ✨"
Night in the Woods,commenting to help you out in the algorithm
Night in the Woods,"I think the idea that they’re all animals is because of maes depersonalization is a stretch. Animals look better in the style they were going for, and can give personality to the characters just by loooking at them"
Night in the Woods,Some of this is filler and overly complicated with your explanations but decent video
Night in the Woods,"I know this is a very unpopular opinion to have, but I am glad you approached Alec's death from a neutral standpoint. Personally, I am one of those who think he was wronged. Pushed. And that's using the mildest of terms. Because when it comes down to it, a person as died. An artist, who'se work remains. In which he will live on. If only it wasn't so sad, because history will likely just see him as the perpetrator, not a victim."
Night in the Woods,"Mae discusses the statue at the party, it's the college's founder and she says it was always pointing down at her
I also have little doubt that Mae was going to throw herself into that hole if her friends didn't come"
Night in the Woods,"I played this game as a kid, so I never really understood it. It’s really nice to get an explanation like this."
Night in the Woods,criminally underrated youtuber
Night in the Woods,"9:53 actually, mae doesn’t have a cell phone! no one does! there is no cell service in possum springs (only wifi in some places)"
Night in the Woods,A lot of the confusion is explained in the game..
Night in the Woods,"Aaaand subbed. I watched the whole thing :) and I agree. This has become my favorite game.  Out of all the games I love, none have stuck with me as powerfully as this one.
Also, Beatrice was definitely my fave, as well."
Night in the Woods,"I search ""nitw retrospective"" every few months just to find such hidden gems. Really enjoyed your vid. Great job, keep it up."
Night in the Woods,"it always frustrated me when nobody stopped to consider why mae was no longer in college, bea blindly resents her without ever considering that mar left college for a valid reason. i've always connected to mae as someone who struggles with both chronic illness and mental illnesses that held me back in comparison to my peers and i wished mae's struggle to progress in milestones due to her dissociative disorder was explored more."
Night in the Woods,Man this is such a great video
Night in the Woods,"loved this review, keep up the amazing high quality vids 👍"
Night in the Woods,"9:55 im pretty sure a giant part of the story about possum springs is that they don't have reception there, so yeah that explains that."
Night in the Woods,"Is it just me or am I extremely glad this game isn't mainstream? Imagine the community, see what undertale is? Is that what you want nitw to become? It's great the way it is.
I have a genuine fear of this, nitw is also my top 1 game and I love it, I love the characters and everything, but a huge fear for me is that one day a huge streamer might play it and make it extremely popular and there it goes, the community will go into a hole and become cringe as heck probably, children will play the game even if it's made for adults, the community will be full of children. Im genuenly scared of that."
Night in the Woods,Is this a re-upload?  I swear that I've watched this video essay before.
Night in the Woods,How does this not have at LEAST a thousand views?
Night in the Woods,"You are telling me this only has just under 800 views? You have made light of such a beautiful game and the story in amazing depth. Thank you for bringing back this game from when I first watched it in 2017. You have made such a beautiful video, and I was able to reminiscence. Thank you"
Night in the Woods,Please read adastra and come back to me.
Night in the Woods,This video was incredible. I was 16 when this game came out and I think you described it perfectly. I didn’t understand it completely at first but you helped me to. Thank you.
Night in the Woods,Listen I have had such an attachment to this game just through the story alone Mae is literally me so much so that I have her tattooed on me!
Night in the Woods,I thought this video had thousands of views. I don't understand how this can be so underrated
Night in the Woods,"Bedsheet Ghost, when will you start streaming again?"
Night in the Woods,"Bedsheet nice video , BTW I noticed you deleted some old videos , can i know why?"
Night in the Woods,damn! how long did this take to make?
Night in the Woods,"This is such an amazing video, criminally underrated! I'm sharing this with all my friends."
Night in the Woods,"This was REALLY well done! I loved it, and appreciate the dedication you put into this video about my favorite indie game."
Night in the Woods,"Yooo! Nice pfp change!
Holy crap dude this video was so well made god damn, thought I was watching a youtuber with 1 million+ subscribers for a second. This video is really informative and entertaining, good fucking job dude. Just remember...




CTRL TO AUTO-AIM!"
Night in the Woods,"I don't regret watching this vid cuz I wouldn't know about this game otherwise, on the other hand I was spoiled the whole game. Nice video anyway."
Night in the Woods,Bedsheet ghost / lampshade / octobercelebrations is back at it again
Transistor,"Well done loved the Presentation, you sold this one to me minute one."
Transistor,Really trying to convince myself to like the game it just doesn't do it for me
Transistor,What a lame reason to hold this game back. This was a 10
Transistor,What is that opening track @ign
Transistor,is this better than Hades?
Transistor,who else came from 2021?
Transistor,"Question. I'm guessing all the art is 2D, including the playable character. Or are some of the aspects of this game 3D.

also if it turns out the character is 3D then, is it possible to make a game like this but with a 2D playable character."
Transistor,the soundtrack + artistic integrity of this game is worth five points alone tbh
Transistor,Supergiant games is small team with superb games.
Transistor,Just brought Transistor on the Nintendo Switch and I'm leaving the game. Thanks to the Black Friday Deals in EShop i got the game for 2.99
Transistor,JUST PURCHASED THIS AND HADES THIS MORNING HADES WAS 20%OFF AND THIS WAS 80% OFF I GOT TWO GEMS FROM SUPERGIANT GAMES 💯💎🙏🏿🔥🎮🕹
Transistor,"If you are reading this right now, buy this game! Only 3.99 on the Nintendo e-shop right now until 12/2/2020!"
Transistor,"Here after playing my first supergiant title, Hades"
Transistor,"Beautiful game, frustrating combat."
Transistor,I played this game for the first time in 2020 and I love how you can equip attacks and if they can't fit you can always equip them as an alternative secondary or passive ability. This allowed for many different combos which was fun to play with!
Transistor,yea like I'm gonna listen to some broad wailing  for hours
Transistor,Just 6 hours? I saw steam reviews with 20 hr+ reviews. Probably replays
Transistor,How long is gameplay time?
Transistor,4$ on eShop right now
Transistor,Can you reply this as many times as u want?
Transistor,Super Giant Games... thank you
Transistor,"TBH I didn't like this game at all, the combat wasn't satisfying as I hoped it will be also the movement felt so slow and limiting.
but the music was nice even the art style I liked it a lot also the sword's voice is sexy NGL"
Transistor,I just found this in my PS4 library. I'm glad I did.
Transistor,Would like the game if it wasn't so freakin easy
Transistor,Soundtrack it self making me buy this game. 😅
Transistor,Anyone come here in 2020 because of Hades?
Transistor,#bringbackmarty
Transistor,"*see transistor*

Electrical Engineer : are they NPN or PNP ? This is not what i'm looking for"
Transistor,4$ in e shop now!
Transistor,I miss Marty Sliva :(
Transistor,Who its play for start plz?
Transistor,I think she should make into Super Smash Ultimate
Transistor,"I honestly thought the game was really boring, and gave up 30 mins in.
It just feels like I’m just always waiting to use the combo"
Transistor,Got it for $1 on switch
Transistor,"8/23/2019 Nintendo Switch sale, games only $3.99."
Transistor,"This is one of the first titles i ever bought on ps4. Somehow i just never finished it. supergiant made 2 more acclaimed indie titles bastion and pyre. And none of these games i felt the urge to complete either.. I love some of the slick aesthetics and the graphics in transistor. the ost is also fantastic.
Still.. Not fun to play. some cool stuff the the devs like and then all of a sudden its unique game experience?
Some gustav klimt, little bit of jazz,  noir, a neon sword, I don't know..
Bloodstained was also highly praised to the sky and that game was boring all the way through. Like disneys version of sotn.
Still love Indie games forever I just played countless better games"
Transistor,Well this the indie generation lol
Transistor,whats the starting somg? i only know spine of their soundtrack but i like this one allot too
Transistor,tbh i did not enjoy this game
Transistor,yeah i got this game for free just now
Transistor,Free on epic.
Transistor,Transistor ost ❤️😭❤️🦆❤️
Transistor,Absolute phenomenal game
Transistor,Thank you for the review beacuse now i can play the game.
Transistor,Cybill was soo annoying
Transistor,this game is free on epic games store now
Transistor,This game is currently free in Epic Games store
Transistor,Just got the game today lol Gonna play it soon.
Transistor,Anyone here from epic games?
Transistor,Who is here because it will be free in Epic Store?
Transistor,"I love She Shines and The Spine from this game,"
Transistor,any1 here still playing this in 2019 just to listen to the music
Transistor,"To whoever might be disappointed about the gameplay, IGN isn't even utilizing HALF of what could be done with the game's mechanics, so don't be. Just read the game's review by the Kotaku. It's better explained."
Transistor,Well it will be free on epic store next month
Transistor,free on epic games store in the next 2 weeks ;)
Transistor,"At the risk of sounding like what some game snobs (whose opinions I should not care about snyway) would call a simpleton, this game looks like it might be a little too complicated for me."
Transistor,I have this game on ps4!! I refused to play it because it never came on vita now that I just bought a switch its mine!!!!
Transistor,They need a Physical Release of this game to!
Transistor,I redownloaded this game because of arbys
Transistor,Bought all 3 supergiant games a few weeks ago on sale. They are all amazing in their own way and I don't know why I held off so long...
Transistor,BEST GAME EVER MADE! Nothing compares now!
Transistor,"Feels like ""Bladerunner merged with Cowboy Bepop"" ? Damn, I'll check this out then"
Transistor,Y A  l I K E  J A Z Z
Transistor,"amazing game, amazing soundtrack. deserves no less than 10/10"
Transistor,go on jazzy drum 'n' bass soundtrack!
Transistor,"My only critic of this game is that it is too short, the challenge backroom extends it a bit but it would be much better if it was longer like Bastion."
Transistor,I'd really love to see a modern remake of Magic & Mayhem made like Transistor.  The gameplay was very similar but it was even better than Transistor.  It just needs a major graphical update to make it smoother.
Transistor,Ign:find a flaw in evreyting
Transistor,I'd rather Play Bioshock 2
Transistor,whats the song starting from 1:50 ?
Transistor,"I have to agree with your glowing review. Just dedicated a weekend to Bastion and Transistor. Was absolutely blown away with how enthralled I was (am) with Transistor. The story is fantastic and not spoon fed. You as a player must think about it, and even by the final credits you don't get complete confirmation. The battle system and RPG upgrade mechanics are a stellar highlight. Everything just flows so smoothly and you have a seemingly infinite amount of build possibilities. I can't recommend this more to fans of 16 bit turn based and real time RPGs. Enjoy the ride!"
Transistor,this was the best game of 2016...red stole my heart:-)
Transistor,"Bought this for 2,99 on my iPhone. It's games like these that make iOS the best current platform for mobile gaming. The Vita and Switch can't hold a candle to the amazingly rich diversity in quality games"
Transistor,"Now I want to go back and beat for the third time, thanks!"
Transistor,Is this worth $4?
Transistor,is it on PS Vita?
Transistor,I know this is old but this game is amazing I got all the achievements and replayed it many times I definatly reccomend it
Transistor,I cant hear your voice as the background also talking at the same time
Transistor,"Got her voice taken away

Hears her grunting in combat"
Transistor,Well deserved that whole 9. 👍
Transistor,"just finished this game and it was good but not masterpiece to me (personal opinion)
combat system, and function system are unique and story is ok with me
good game, good mood"
Transistor,"I remember getting this on PS Plus, amazing art style and astounding music!"
Transistor,"Happy it got ported to iPhone.....
Really enjoying it"
Transistor,I'm playng it and it is a total masterpiece. I hadn't played an awsome RPG game like this one since Valkyria Profile Silmeria on ps2.
Transistor,"It looks like a cyberpunk Child of Light, such a beauty! I'll keep that in mind"
Transistor,Got this on PS Plus last year pretty great game.
Transistor,Transistor and its soundtrack's part of the Steam Summer Sale right now!
Transistor,Am I the only one who discovered Transistor because I was going an online search about the 311 album of the same name?
Transistor,Only $5 in the flash sale
Transistor,"I was loving this game until I realise that the voice over wasn't going away. I want to be left alone in my games and not have someone constantly talking in my ear. If he isn't helping then shut up.

Honestly, I am quitiing the game and I hate doing so because it is brilliant, inventive and beautiful, but I cannot stand a constant companion whispering to me."
Transistor,Best soundtrack ever
Transistor,Can i play this without a mouse? (Mac)
Transistor,"This games on sale right now for $5 on PS4's flash sale. Picked up this and Bastion (which was only $3.75) which is a steal for both games. Hyped to finally play them, they look awesome."
Transistor,One of the most spectacular games. art style is insane
Transistor,"Absolutely amazing experience playing this game. I'm not fan boying either when I say its 5/5 stars all around, game art, gameplay, story, everything. Must play RPG. It needs the attention it deserves! Needs another game or remake it expanded"
Transistor,Cowboy Bebop X Blade Runner ? *_* I'm getting this game !
Transistor,so how long is this game?
Transistor,What is the difference between the Mac version and the iOS? Would they release it on the Vita as well?
Transistor,"Great looking game. Reviewer sounds like he's whispering whilst slobbering, deeply unsettling."
Transistor,The game is pretty much like e-version of 1984.. lost in tiny world
Transistor,Damn good review!
Transistor,Masterpiece. Best indie game ever made.
Transistor,"Its pretty okay. I think that there are way too many similar indie games, i actually hate how many indie games there are, they just dillute the game pool too much. I think its above average for sure but im not sold on it being a great experience  but i can see why someone would"
Transistor,"I think there's another reason why Transistor doesn't look like your typical dystopian future. I think the game implies that people live in a virtual universe. Like, not just log in to cyberspace, but apparently moved the whole of society into cyberspace. They can even choose the color of the sky via polls.
The process even have the same name as computer applications when you open Task Manager in Windows. And I think the Transistor is supposed to be a human interface device, like a mouse or a keyboard, that allows the people of Cloudbank to run the system they live in. It even has RAM memory that allows you... or rather force you to chose it's ability configuration."
Transistor,Transistor is the cyberpunk adventure mystery that a more tolerant modern Agatha Christie would influence...ridiculously beautiful graphics and artstyle.
Transistor,Thanks for spoilers in the first 2 minutes of a review
Transistor,"0:51 not gonna lie, Cyberpunk with a soul would have been a banger of a title."
Transistor,I listened to this soundtrack for a good two years before I finally got around to playing through the game and finishing it. It’s a fanatic game! Not sure why is took me so long to get around to it.
Transistor,I stumbled upon this video after randomly thinking about Transistor. I remember when I first got my PS4 and it was one of the first games I played on it… such a beautiful story.
Transistor,Nice video! I got this game on Steam and haven't got around to playing it yet. Does the battle have similarity with the original Parasite Eve?
Transistor,"This game made me want to go into game design, but seeing how well it's executed gives me anxiety 😂"
Transistor,"Came here cause of hades. Have you played it?
Might buy this again on switch to have it portable not played on years 😉"
Transistor,Couldn't have said it better myself.
Transistor,This is a great game. I've beaten this on multiple platforms and am still not tired of it. Also the music is 👌🏻👌🏻
Transistor,good  review.  keep it up.  gonna buy this rn on steam for $3 :)
Transistor,Played Transistor by accident as my roommate back in 2016 had it on his PS4 but never tried it so I fired it up and played it non stop for about 2 weeks love this game
Transistor,"Great summery! I normally don't replay games, but I replay this every few years and love it each time. The gameplay is engaging and intense, but the art and music are the icing on the cake for me"
Transistor,If Gustav Klimt made a cyberpunk game with a 20's jazz era aesthetic
Transistor,"Your channel is ""absolutely brilliant"". Feels bad you don't have the thousands and thousands of more subscribers that you deserve. All I can do is support your work and say,  keep it up your doing great content!  :)"
Transistor,"So i've sunk about 50-60 hours into Hades already and can see my self sinking far more to come. Bastion was one of my favorite games of all time, and Pyre was such a delight but this game ... i've tried over and over to like it and I think this video just inspired me to try and give it another shot and really pay attention to the narrative this time around."
Transistor,"Good to have you back, great video. Haven't played Transistor yet, but I'm heart and soul deep in Hades at the moment - and it seems like much of what you found good about Transistor was further polished and explored in Hades. Subtle, slow burning character building and storytelling being good examples of this. I'd be interested to hear your comparative views if you've played Hades."
Transistor,New video from my boy and I'm here. Keep up the good work man
Transistor,Outstanding work man! Subbed & Liked!
Transistor,"Today I started Pyre, a friend of mine told me he wants to play Hades and now your video on Transistor. Supergiant day much? All that aside wonderful video!"
Transistor,"Comment and like all this man’s videos so he gets the views. The gamers need to see this channel, and this man deserves the love."
Transistor,Nicely edited and extremely well put together! Absolutely fantastic.
Transistor,Nice review! Really captures the essence of the game. The game is a little short imo but it's still awesome.
Transistor,Yes! You’re back. Love your vids. Keep up the great work.
Transistor,Love your videos keep it coming!
Darkest Dungeon,Dude where's the Crusader😢
Darkest Dungeon,"Sounds like some of the same problems exist from the first game that stopped me playing that one, too; a very unforgiving game that demands a lot from you, while not giving you much control over the game. Seems like a recipe for ‘feelsbadman’. I’ll stick to Slay The Spire."
Darkest Dungeon,When is it comming to PS5?
Darkest Dungeon,"I'll Bet get a same fate from Gollum
but it wasnt"
Darkest Dungeon,"It's a bit weird to say, but the initial state of the EA build was more appealing to me. The first day of release I've beated it in the second run, so it lacked some fairness, but the fact that you had controls over some of the more gruesome meters made it more enjoyable to me than the direction the full released done. It's interesting, beautiful and pleasing for sure nonetheless, just feel more grindy and random than it was in the early access version."
Darkest Dungeon,"Oh, so between 60 and 80 depending on how clever you are... And it took yo 62 hours??? Yo must be soooooo clever!!! Lol"
Darkest Dungeon,This looks exactly like warhammer… doesn’t it?
Darkest Dungeon,"Graphic 10/10
Gameplay 6/10
Soldout to EGS 100/10"
Darkest Dungeon,Darkest Dungeon takes RNG to another level. I'd like to see those speedrunning cheaters beat this game in under an hour. Heh.
Darkest Dungeon,'Overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.'
Darkest Dungeon,"Your input is pretty irrelevant for large sections of the game and your tactics are about as valid as a slot machine player with a ""system""."
Darkest Dungeon,Removing the city is definitely the worst idea they could've undertake.
Darkest Dungeon,"My question is
How does it compare to the first one"
Darkest Dungeon,Packs laden with loot are often short on supplies.
Darkest Dungeon,This was written by Ai.
Darkest Dungeon,"Feel bad when you don't give the team a break, then they die of a heart attack."
Darkest Dungeon,Nothing beat Fear and Hunger
Darkest Dungeon,Thank you Jon Bolding for a high quality review
Darkest Dungeon,This was a huge spoiler review lol
Darkest Dungeon,"Game for masochists tbh. Funny, intelligent but somehow so annoying. Niche stuff. Enjoy."
Darkest Dungeon,"The game is unenjoyable, a huuuge stepback from DD1. Way overtuned and overengineered, progress is exteremely hard and slow, replay the first few combats endlessly to gain some bonuses and hope to improve a little bit on your next run. It's a dumb grind. And people say it's replayable. LOOOOL! Imagine playing chess and having to restart the game in 4-5 steps all the time. Then after 20 games you can advance to 5-6 steps and so on. How replayable indeed."
Darkest Dungeon,Huge step back towards chinese mobile games...
Darkest Dungeon,Said rogue like twice
Darkest Dungeon,Personally not a fan of grinding in a singleplayer game. But the graphics.. 10/10!
Darkest Dungeon,The game takes 60-100hrs to complete depending on how smart you are. It took me 42 hours
Darkest Dungeon,They brought wayne june back! whens it coming to switch?
Darkest Dungeon,Surprising that the narrator isn't featured in every Warhammer game
Darkest Dungeon,8/10
Darkest Dungeon,VO recorded and mastered by a 6 year old.
Darkest Dungeon,"Sounds like the reviewer didn't play the first game... The RNG and screaming at THE RNG is one of the biggest reasons ppl play darkest dungeon.. the frustrating yet rewarding experience that comes with a run. Sometimes it's cheers, sometimes it's cursing at the RNG gods but you go back in because it's the gamble that draws you in"
Darkest Dungeon,8
Darkest Dungeon,When does this come to console ??
Darkest Dungeon,У меня есть морские свинкиа у тебя хороший канал
Darkest Dungeon,"Actually a pretty insightfull review from IGN, well done!"
Darkest Dungeon,I'm loving this game. It's easier than the first one but to return to this world and characters is a really nice experience
Darkest Dungeon,Be wary! Triumphant pride precipitates a dizzying fall.
Darkest Dungeon,"the game was released almost 2 full years ago. But people are acting like it just dropped.
What dumb timeline is this?"
Darkest Dungeon,really makes you feel like your having a meltdown
Darkest Dungeon,Why does this reviewer have so many random pauses mid-sentence lmao. Bro heard someone do it once and just turned it up to 1000
Darkest Dungeon,The hero reads an unsettling passage
Darkest Dungeon,Put it on PS5 already
Darkest Dungeon,Was the crusader removed?
Darkest Dungeon,This game is more about decision making than gambling
Darkest Dungeon,These nightmarish creatures can be felled! They can be beaten!
Darkest Dungeon,"More arrive, foolishly seeking fortune and glory in this domain of the damned..."
Darkest Dungeon,"Yeah..i dont like it...refunded. Instead of a town, a fortress would have been cool. Different vibe and less towny stuff."
Darkest Dungeon,"Wow, ign reviewed an indie game."
Darkest Dungeon,This is the best review I've ever seen come from IGN. Bravo 👏
Darkest Dungeon,IGN remains one of the worst review sites. They just stick people to review games that have no passion for the game so the critiques are just wrong.
Darkest Dungeon,Can’t wait for that console release!
Darkest Dungeon,Greatly put!
Darkest Dungeon,It's an 8
Darkest Dungeon,After listening to the review it doesn't seem like the number score matters. You could have given it a 10 but it still sounds like it's no fun at all
Darkest Dungeon,"""One more to throw on the growing corpse pile."""
Darkest Dungeon,"Absolutely love this game. Has its issues, but it is a consistently fun and engaging Roguelike."
Darkest Dungeon,Wait.. The reviewer is saying it took him 62 hours to beat the shackles boss for the first time? Is that what he's saying?
Darkest Dungeon,"Really don't like the new stage coach system. Probably the worst part is you're forced to play for a long time with just a few heroes that have just a few of their skills unlocked. Gets boring and repetitive, a contrast to dozens of hero combos you could make right from the get go in the original."
Darkest Dungeon,"""A moment of valor shines brightest against a backdrop of despair."" - The Ancestor."
Darkest Dungeon,"Why is the horse just ramming in to every rubish purpose, they could even go around. Won't last long that way"
Darkest Dungeon,Looks awesome
Darkest Dungeon,Time to die all over again
Darkest Dungeon,"Did anyone ever find out who wrote those lines for the narrator? I'll never forget ""Curious is the trapmaker's art"""
Darkest Dungeon,A time to perform beyond one's limits!
Darkest Dungeon,Wow ign can play a hard game like this?
Darkest Dungeon,Wish this was on console at launch.
Darkest Dungeon,Going rogue lite was a mistake.
Darkest Dungeon,Boohoo. Can't stand professional game reviewers spend half their time complaining about difficulty.
Darkest Dungeon,"Sounds far too RNG based to be fun. You ""git gud"" and then still get shafted anyway... no thanks."
Darkest Dungeon,"The narration in darkest dungeon and I'm assuming DD2, is the best part."
Darkest Dungeon,"The last updates they did before the official release were goated, really made the game more enjoyable"
Darkest Dungeon,they didn't give it a 7... which means they actually played it
Darkest Dungeon,Wow this reviewer is so fcking annoying
Darkest Dungeon,"Meta progression like this has always been a bit of a double edged sword for me: On one hand, players need to be rewarded for the time that they invest in the game, even when they lose. On the other hand, it creates a game that's practically impossible to win in the early stages because you're expected to have the permanent upgrades to proceed. The game is challenging because it is unfair, not because of the players lack of skill and knowledge of the game."
Darkest Dungeon,Does anyone know what the ancestors quote app is called for android. Seems to have disappeared from the playstore
Darkest Dungeon,so are you just gonna detract points because it's a roguelike? classic ign
Darkest Dungeon,You remember our venerable house
Darkest Dungeon,"""Worse you can do is survive through it all. Healed scars, lost allies and the darkest of thoughts will bring you to the brink of both madness and victory. With a strike, you can make a better world which you will not belong to. Extinguish thy own flame, warrior. Hope has dawned, but, alas, you are owed to the darkest dungeon."""
Darkest Dungeon,When is coming to consoles like switch?? 😢
Darkest Dungeon,"Imagine there's a darkest dungeon in real life, and a youtuber class comes to review the dungeon ........."
Darkest Dungeon,Prodigious size alone does not dissuade the sharpened blade.
Darkest Dungeon,where dungeon
Darkest Dungeon,Darkest Dungeon 3....we can go darker!
Darkest Dungeon,"Isn’t Darkest Dungeon 2 few years old game?
Why Review now?"
Darkest Dungeon,"The narrator is absolutely one of the best parts of the game, perfect VA."
Darkest Dungeon,Teetering on the brink. Facing the abyss.
Darkest Dungeon,The Elden ring of Turn based combat 10/10
Darkest Dungeon,"Game patches will overcome many problems

Even the big ones"
Darkest Dungeon,Confidence SURGES as the enemy crumbles
Darkest Dungeon,the Darkest Dungeon series is definitely in my top 5 most beautiful games. The eerily crisp and stylistic art is top-notch imo
Darkest Dungeon,"For me, it's 10 out of 10. Very high replayability, great art, atmospheric music, and a deep combat system."
Darkest Dungeon,Has anyone bought the move wrights yeat?
Darkest Dungeon,"People have no clue what to think about ""randomness"" in games. In fact, DD2 having a hundred different random outcomes is precisely why it's a game with a high degree of skill: Because when there's this much randomness, your ability to manage risk and adapt become crucial skills. In games with only a few places where luck matters, you actually have far less room to exert control over them. This is how the ""Law of large numbers"" applies to games. If they have a little bit of randomness, the player who is luckiest will win. If they have a lot of randomness, your total result will always be pretty close to the average, so it's ultimately skill that is the most important.

As someone who plays a lot of board games, this is an infuriating misunderstanding that is constantly applied to highly skillful games that use things like dice. People constantly winge about a game being a luckfest where your rolls determine whether you win, meanwhile I'm over here winning 99% of the time."
Darkest Dungeon,"The first statements by the reviewer are very true. My feeling, however, is that the outcome is so random to the extent that any effort and dedication devoted in strategising and planning can go to complete waste in a bad run and there’s nothing you can do about it."
Darkest Dungeon,The lack of sense of progression and attachment to the characters in the first game are a huge turn off for me😢
Darkest Dungeon,you mean darkest adventure 2? literally zero dungeon in the game lmao.
Darkest Dungeon,2 Dark 2 Dungeon
Darkest Dungeon,"Curious is the trapmaker's art, his efficacy unwitnessed by his own eyes."
Darkest Dungeon,When is 3 gonna be out? ;)
Darkest Dungeon,The dungeon so nice they darkened it twice
Darkest Dungeon,Seems the Flagellant has lost some... skin since the first game.
Darkest Dungeon,Why does this guy kinda sound like William Shatner.
Darkest Dungeon,Looks overcomplicated.
Darkest Dungeon,Havent heard a game that has characters that dies from a heart attack.
Darkest Dungeon,"got this on gamepass, was gonna try it but it looks way too hard for me"
Darkest Dungeon,Fear is the mind killer

Darkest Dungeon,"2:22  - ""A grind is only a bad thing when the act of playing becomes predictable and repetitive"". Who TF writes this crap? A grind is called a ""grind"" because IT IS predictable and repetitive. If it's fun and fulfilling then it's just hard gameplay, not a grind."
Darkest Dungeon,what happens when all your heroes dies

Darkest Dungeon,Probably the best turn based game I’ve ever played in years....2 years on and still playing. Well worth the dosh 💰👍
Darkest Dungeon,This game feels like the table top call of cthulhu and Dungeons and dragons mixed together.
Darkest Dungeon,money cardi b music video
Darkest Dungeon,This is not a game. Is just torture.
Darkest Dungeon,I f@cking hate this game.
Darkest Dungeon,The dark souls of turn-based games
Darkest Dungeon,This game is more fun then all my 50+ gig AAA Games.. Been a long time since i deeply enjoyed a Game like this.. I hope they make more like this
Darkest Dungeon,is this game is like dragon warriors 3 from game boy color?
Darkest Dungeon,EXECUTED WITH IMPUNITY!!!
Darkest Dungeon,Don't like the idea of randomized turns. How can you use tactics?
Darkest Dungeon,"I don't remember this being mentioned bui there is one aspect in which this game shines: the character classes. There is absolutely no ""useless class"" to play with - every one of them will excell in a certain dungeon or situation and will be fun to play with. Even the clumsy Antiquarian comes in handy when you are short on money or you want to see the pathetic ""nervous stab"" just because... It's a ""nervous stab"" and I love that name. There is the ""totally usefull"" class, though, but you don't need to carry that Vestal with you all the time."
Darkest Dungeon,"So it’s DnD but Bloodborne?

_I’ll take your entire stock!_"
Darkest Dungeon,its becaise its too unbalanced
Darkest Dungeon,In simple terms: Darkest Dungeon is sadistic chess.
Darkest Dungeon,"I just got this. And I thought I would enjoy it. But once your characters get stressed, everything goes down hill. I got to the Farmstead. And after wave and wave of enemies my fighter gained 'abusive' and my team fell apart...to hell with it."
Darkest Dungeon,It kinda reminds me of Pokemon Nuzlocke
Darkest Dungeon,"So.......this is like Oregon trail,...but for adults?"
Darkest Dungeon,This game mixed me with everything as soon as I played it I instantly lost all my drive to beat games so I just give up now I never did it before but I do it now this game changed me
Darkest Dungeon,"Just finish this game. Just fcking nerve wracking, sometimes I be like "" nice dodge, critical hit YAY "" next time "" WTF why did u MISS?? where this fcking trap come from??? "" the randomness is brutal..."
Darkest Dungeon,"*""Remind yourself that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.""*"
Darkest Dungeon,"""slowly, gently, that is how a life is taken"""
Darkest Dungeon,I've never played a game so incredibly frustrating and entertaining at the same time before.
Darkest Dungeon,It looks crap about 15 years too old
Darkest Dungeon,"I really loved this game right away. And it is not as hard or complicated as some people make it sound (except to equip trinkets, that's complicated :p )"
Darkest Dungeon,Is that Optimus Prime?
Darkest Dungeon,My whole team of pro lvl 6's died when the final boss's (heart of darkness) hp was 52. I haven't played since
Darkest Dungeon,"""7.8 Too Much Darkness"""
Darkest Dungeon,I used to like pigs until this game...
Darkest Dungeon,Jonathan Thurston = GOAT
Darkest Dungeon,"I absolutely detest this game. Think you have to be pretty sadistic to get a kick out of the strategy element of this game. After 30 hours and getting wiped out after grinding yet again, I was like nope, not worth my time"
Darkest Dungeon,The game looks like something fit for a 8 yr old.
Darkest Dungeon,"No transgender dungeon, 4 out of 10."
Darkest Dungeon,No talk about the stress system or quirks at all??
Darkest Dungeon,"I absolutely love the art style of this game, but it just doesn't seem like my cup of tea.
I may still need to give it a try."
Darkest Dungeon,Love the art style; who is the illustrator?
Darkest Dungeon,Finally on xbox. I cant stop playing! Its so good i even stopped playing Monster Hunter!🤤
Darkest Dungeon,Such a great game! Everyone should at least try it and support the developers!
Darkest Dungeon,Ign sux
Darkest Dungeon,Secret of mana 1 and 2 are much better rpg´s
Darkest Dungeon,5 bucks on App Store
Darkest Dungeon,Switch release tomorrow think it might be worth to get it now?
Darkest Dungeon,If a lot of people love this game the world would be a better place to live.
Darkest Dungeon,Just got done with dark souls I’m excited to start hating myself again!
Darkest Dungeon,Has anyone played this on the PS Vita and what are your thoughts on the Vita version? I want to get it on my Vita but would appreciate it if someone can tell me how it is on Vita versus the consoles and PC versions.
Darkest Dungeon,"I think this game is great! Not only because its dark fantasy, but also because the exact opposite of what gamers want: everything can be solved by skill!
In this Game its like real life, sometimes you cant get what you want no matter your knowledge, and sometimes you will loose something or someone, and there is nothing you can do to stop it. also it doesnt get announced when you are in danger. in the middle of a fight all four of your charakters can suddenly get a heart-attack and the next enemy hit all for of you with a crit! 
Many Poeple complain about it because they think this is dark souls or bloodborne, where the difficulti relies on your skill, but actually, its the exact opposite of dark souls: You know where you are going, you can rest anytime, the unexpected can happen (which is truly unavoidable) and everything is randomly made."
Darkest Dungeon,What a game.
Darkest Dungeon,This Review is original or you're copy too?
Darkest Dungeon,Cool
Darkest Dungeon,haha thats sick
Darkest Dungeon,"People saying ""Git Gud"" are only trying to be edgy. This is a terrible RPG with poor strategy mechanics, and GIT GUD only applies to games that aren't turn-based bore fests. This is literally the equivalent of playing Dungeons and Dragons and rolling dice around in a basement filled with neckbeards. Only ""unique"" aspect of this game is the second health bar known as stress."
Darkest Dungeon,This game is fantastic. I bought it a while back while on early acess and played for a bit and forgot. I just started playing again and I'm hooked. Surprisingly too a decent review from ign. That doesn't happen very often.
Darkest Dungeon,"This is one of the worst games I have ever played! First I want to say it is not as bad as Rambo or ride to hell. This game is very repetitive in its game play. Like Pokemon in some way. It's based on turn based strategy. The main problems I have with this game is the constant rate my players get heart attack even not when fully stressed out. I would say it is a unique mechanic but that lack of ways to heal your character when he is stressed just makes it frustrating to play. I have to spend lots of money to heal them from stress and disease so much that I barely have money to train and give my guys better equipment. This game is okay I feel like this game should have stayed alpha for an extra year in its development so it can less brutal on new players and different type of gaming audiences. I still want this game to be challenging and tough, just not as hard as dark souls or demon souls in some aspects. Good game but I only get it at a discount. No full price ."
Darkest Dungeon,"I feel Darkest Dungeon is a good idea, a really damn good idea but there are two problems:

1: The game isn't so much fiddly as there are some things that seem implemented solely to act as additional frustrations and for no other reason.  Such as classes that refuse to work together.  Apart from minor background aesthetic, it really serves no purpose that to prevent the player from using specific combinations.  Which does nothing but aggravate.  The hardest difficulty seems geared almost solely around this for artificial challenge that isn't entirely incorporated well into the game.  Your free to take your time, but the game does have certain rare but nonetheless frustrating brick walls in particular areas.

2: It's completely against the grain of instant gratification.  That's not an issue with a game itself so much as the market it would shoot for.  Much like Xcom the game is built to be tackled slowly and with great care, making calculated risks that more often than not fail and forcing you to make the most of a bad situation.  Unlike Xcom, however, missions aren't meant to be tackled under 1 sitting most of the time.  It's much like playing D&D in that you have to come back failure after failure, plunge after plunge, to get the sweet, sweet fruits of success."
Darkest Dungeon,How much does it cost
Darkest Dungeon,"Dan seemed to have only 2 mins and 45 seconds to review, or he'd be shot by firing squad for going over..."
Darkest Dungeon,joke of a game to be perfectly honest
Darkest Dungeon,"The art design seems to be inspired by Mike mignolia comics (Hellboy, The amazing screw on head)
and it really makes it stand out from the rest, plus the stress / light mecanics makes it a unique experience."
Darkest Dungeon,I really like this game. I was pleasantly surprised. I stayed away for the longest time due to the reviews saying how hard it was. I am by no means a hardcore gamer but I dont find the game THAT hard. I am new however.
Darkest Dungeon,this game was a huge disappointment for me. sticking to souls games. huge let down. hidden gem is an overstatement. don't buy this
Darkest Dungeon,IGN ad on an IGN vid.
Darkest Dungeon,"This game definetely highers your IQ.

I will play this instead of studying finals and see how it goes"
Darkest Dungeon,"I stopped playing this game for my own good because I got too much emotionally involved with it. Your character does not die instantly; you could see your character dying one by one move and when it dies it would never come back(sure you would get a replacement of same class). The game gives emotional scar to your character. I, as a player, got that too and when my fav character died, I got stressed and decided not to play this game anymore. So far this is the best game ever -- one heck of a roller-coaster ride."
Darkest Dungeon,"I really like the game looks, but goddamn it's confusing to me. Gonna go back and play it, but I might have to skim through some kind of primer before I start."
Darkest Dungeon,"I bought this game while it was on sale a few days ago. And today while playing this on Christmas eve, I went into a lair filled with ugly monster pig people. And my family is having ham for Christmas dinner tonight. XD 

Kind of ironic isn't it? lol"
Darkest Dungeon,meh
Darkest Dungeon,"""..even the turn order is mixed by behind the scenes dice rolls...""   - That sentence alone proves how little IGN reviews actually dive into the game mechanics."
Florence,Krish should have been in the art gallery at the end
Florence,"Great review thanks,I’m a terrible gamer, so always need to know it’s not too hard"
Florence,If that's great - what other game to g oto?
Florence,"Made in Abyss OST GUY IS IN THIS????
That stuff was beauty in the show"
Florence,Ill get it tonight for 30 kronor (3 dollar)
Florence,"One of my favourite games ever, very simple but very beautiful and heartfelt"
Florence,Loved this game. Just wish it was longer than 20 mins of gameplay
Florence,If you are looking for a cozy game that doesn't take a lot of time I highly recommend you play this. The game doesn't take to long it's fun to play around with the puzzles and it has a way of tugging on your heart strings.. 10/10 would recommend for people looking for a cozy realistic game.
Florence,"Bought this today on sale on the eShop. Your review is excellent and captured it well, great stuff"
Florence,Kevin Penkin is GOAT
Florence,"great review, thank you! all the best for 2021"
Florence,Picked it up on a sale for 2$ so for me 10/10 made my friends buy it too
Florence,mans got the neck beard tho
Florence,♡♡♡♡♡
Florence,Anyone know what that artstyle is called?
Florence,"I’m not sure why it’s rated T/Teen, all it states under details is “adult themes” so without pre-playing it myself, how appropriate does everyone feel this game is for an 8 year old girl who’s already adept with Zelda Links Awakening, Minecraft and Animal Crossing."
Florence,only cost £5 on the switch and was completely worth it - ended up crying
Florence,Something I feel should be mentioned is that the rumble plays a big part in adding emotion to the story. Love it
Florence,"Hits right in the feels, I was blown away, and the price tag is absolutely worth it. A gem."
Florence,"10/10 highly recommended, beauty graphics, fantastic storytelling. I love it, just 5 dollars XD is a gift."
Florence,Nice game but I expected more for £11.99!
Florence,This game needs more attention
Florence,O
Florence,Valentine's Day game season
Florence,Because why not put an hour long mobile game on Switch? Not like you can get it on any phone for three bucks.
Florence,"Great review, very insightful. I’ll pick this up when the price matches it’s mobile counterparts"
Florence,No offense but why is it 3x more expensive on the switch compared to mobile?
Florence,Mobile game port.
Florence,"What Florence taught me was that not every relationship needs to be eternal to be a good one, sometimes the best ones are the ones that help us grow as people, even after the other person is no longer with us."
Florence,Playing on Switch
Florence,"Dude, it is on Android as well!!!"
Florence,Stories about 20 somethings are always enjoyable!
Florence,Ipad? Is that like a Mario Paint thing?
Florence,Oof
Florence,"I usually look for mobile games so I can just have something to pick up without bringing my Switch, and I always just passes this game, defiantly going to try it!"
Florence,Happy bday 🎉
Florence,Have a very Happy Birthday 🎂🎁
Florence,happy birthday Luis
Florence,Happy birthday!
Florence,Never thought I'd want a mobile game
Florence,A good mobile game? What is this Sorcery!!!!
Florence,"I’ve been looking for a good app for quite some time now (I’ve had one missing spot on my last page). And this works perfectly. I’ve loved this game so far, and I’m very happy I saw this review. Awesome video, man!"
Florence,Happy birthday 🎉
Florence,"Hbd Luis, keep up the great content!"
Florence,HAPPY BIRTHDAY LUIS!!! I love your channel and hope you get a lot subscribers!!! Hope you have an amazing and exciting day!
Florence,"Used to love mobile games but after I got the switch, I literally never game on my phone.."
Florence,"I've Never Heard Of Florence, But AWESOME VIDEO LUIS!"
Florence,I would get it for my iPad but I don’t have money. Very sad. I like the highlights though like how some scenes can be dark with this one person wearing a bright yellow jacket.
Florence,"I'm pissed, this looks so cool... but I'm on android 😅

p.s. HAPPY BIRTHDAY!"
Florence,"This looks great! 
I never would have known about this. Thanks Luis!"
Florence,O F F F F
Florence,But I don't use Apple.
Florence,Whaaaaaaa!?! A mobile game? This isn't the gvn I know.... *hovers mouse over unsubscribe button*
Florence,"Nice review, but im no phone guy"
Florence,Let's all go on a feels trip. (Also that's not me on the iPad it's my roommate lol)

Into the Breach,"boring

Into the Breach,Cool Populous but with mechs.:-)
Into the Breach,Just lost 8 hours to this game last night😂😂😂😂
Into the Breach,Love it
Into the Breach,Love getting to use my noodle in this game
Into the Breach,3:06 he’s only won 3 times(assuming this was his final progress)
Into the Breach,"Into the Breach didn't surprise and intrigued me like FTL did, but it's still a great game! Just know that they are pretty different from each other, even though the tactical element is still very prevalent."
Into the Breach,You had me at Kobayashi Maru.
Into the Breach,Wanted to metaphorically scratch a kaiju game itch. This game did it for me.
Into the Breach,Played this for the first time today on stadia.     Every mission feel like a queens gambit episode.
Into the Breach,This is actually the first roguelike that i actually bother to play
Into the Breach,this game is coming to STADIA in two days for FREE just letting everyone know
Into the Breach,All this game did is make me realize how dumb I truly am. its great though.
Into the Breach,Sounds suspiciously unbalanced. Unsure if I want to buy it or not :-(
Into the Breach,this game strives to make you feel like a robot
Into the Breach,9/10 it has a little something for everyone
Into the Breach,I got it free ! Thanks epic.
Into the Breach,"Installed it this evening. Started playing, hey what time is it: 2 AM... Oh...well, those Veks ain't gonna kill themselves themselves."
Into the Breach,I beat the game in my first try. But the last mountain level is stupidly difficult. Not sure if it is possible whithout some RNG.
Into the Breach,Im here coz its free next week on EGS.
Into the Breach,This game is FREE on the Epic Games store till September 10.
Into the Breach,"This game remind me of something. Ah, yes, chess."
Into the Breach,multiplayer idea?][....uuhh...3vs.3 only...*there*
Into the Breach,This game amazing... And this game seriously need huge dlc..
Into the Breach,Wait... Can we do the Mantis vs Federation battle like in Kestrel Adventures?
Into the Breach,This game is hard.
Into the Breach,The game became much more interesting since they halved the cost for upgrades between islands.
Into the Breach,Currently playing through this; really recommend trying it out.
Into the Breach,This is one of the best games I've ever played
Into the Breach,STILL WAITING ON THAT ANDROID PORT
Into the Breach,"I just read on some website that Into The Breach was the most popular game played in 2018. 

I play all kinds of games all year round. Most of my friends are gamers. I nor my friends have ever heard of this game"
Into the Breach,click ~
Into the Breach,Score is in the thumbnail “spoilers” 😂 this is what I am after in a game.
Into the Breach,It's got a littke something for everybody
Into the Breach,very bad
Into the Breach,who is here after getting free on epic
Into the Breach,It's free right now on Epic Store
Into the Breach,"This beat RimWorld?

K"
Into the Breach,"this game not my cup of tea, grate review"
Into the Breach,Worst game ever
Into the Breach,top on metacritic 2018 list
Into the Breach,I wish this game can play on phone!
Into the Breach,"This game... is low key .. dopest game on Switch.  Took me about 4 hours to figure out how to play properly.  

And the music and sound effects on a high powered receiver?  Primo"
Into the Breach,3 hours?!
Into the Breach,This was the top game of 2018? wtf is happening to gaming
Into the Breach,This isn't a review.. this is a tutorial..
Into the Breach,this was game of the year.............. i'm a nerd and this is dumb.
Into the Breach,Nice!
Into the Breach,"My only complaint is replayability - I'm not really sure why I should keep playing after beating all islands and the last fight. Just to get better score and more mechs? I can kind of see that play out in my head with no need to play the game. I'm a bit sad to see that there weren't any new worlds unlocked, just a few would have kept me going for a lot longer. I hate to be asking for ""moar content"", but that is the killer for me with this game."
Into the Breach,graphics hurt my eyes wish i could play this it looks fun but not worth going blind over.
Into the Breach,Such a masterpiece!!
Into the Breach,"*doesn't really have anything bad to say*

*9/10*"
Into the Breach,This is my game of the year.
Into the Breach,So this game win a Game Award congratulations
Into the Breach,"I dont care how fun it plays, those visuals are ruining this to me"
Into the Breach,?!?!?PS Vita?!?!?
Into the Breach,"beat this game on hard mode. the only hero i used is the one have dodge skill which immune to web. rush damage+ immune (team, building damage) hard at first lv but later easy and easier when your mech deal 4+ damage."
Into the Breach,"Great game, great review."
Into the Breach,We want XCOM on the switch! Make it happen Dana!
Into the Breach,Probably the closest thing we're gonna get to Advance Wars. Stellar game.
Into the Breach,Really? 9/10? This game is almost perfect...
Into the Breach,"just got the switch version. Totally worth it guys. $15 only, lots hours of fun and is very very difficult."
Into the Breach,who can stay awake listening to this
Into the Breach,It reminds me of end war for psp
Into the Breach,This seems excellent... but just bought Bad North for my switch. Will have to wish list this one for later
Into the Breach,"9/10 ""Not enough pixels"" - IGN"
Into the Breach,Can somebody post the link to the original review?
Into the Breach,"You give this a 9 and dragon quest 11 a 8.8. Not taking anything away from this but I mean come on. Look at one and then the other and you're gonna tell me with a straight face this is the better game? Not which one you like more, which one is the objectively better developed game. Its pretty obvious. This is why no one takes your reviews seriously. Or even listens to you."
Into the Breach,Why does he sound like a robot?
Into the Breach,Came to this review since it just came out on the switch
Into the Breach,Umm 😐 9 out of 10 NO THANX it doesn’t even looks great to me
Into the Breach,Laaaaaaaame.
Into the Breach,Mini XCOM. Love it.
Into the Breach,"So this was that ""one more thing"" from the Nindies showing? Ok..."
Into the Breach,It’s in the switch!
Into the Breach,Put this on Switch!
Into the Breach,"""9/10 - Just enough water."" - IGN"
Into the Breach,"""A lot of tactical depth can happen on a simple 8x8 grid""  Like, you know, chess."
Into the Breach,Goddamn white castle
Into the Breach,This game is amazing!
Into the Breach,"mechs vs kaiju in an advance wars type game, sounds awesome."
Into the Breach,Why this commercial HEARTSTONE always showing it's annoying it feels like BEAUTY and the BEAST when they're singing 🎤
Into the Breach,"This game looks simple and is fast paced, but yet so complex... A true masterpiece."
Into the Breach,Are indie games going popular or what? Celeste hollowknight ori and the blind forest and now this shiet
Into the Breach,Looks neato
Into the Breach,Yeah... 9.0? No thanks
Into the Breach,Sing for us dan.
Into the Breach,This game is chess with Mechs. I cannot recommend it enough especially when Multitasking
Into the Breach,BITE ZA DUSTO!
Into the Breach,Switch pls!
Into the Breach,"Did I play this on nintendo in the 80""s"
Into the Breach,can you play this with a controller?
Into the Breach,"It's such a great game for mobile gaming. A great puzzle style of game, with extreme replay value, by offering a semi-rogue gameplay. The round-based makes it accessible on a ""clunky"" touchscreen device that you use not at home. The atmosphere and story adds the ice on the cake. Thank you a lot for pointing exactly that out. (the actual depth, but I added where it is so nice. On top you can quit the game at any time, i.e. when you have to stand up, or the doctor calls you in, or your break at work is over etc. As awesome as you can just hop into the game almost instantaneously)

As a very basic example I want to recommend: Fantasy tactics (android) - it's much more simple, but the levels get more complex each time. You have also about 3 types of ""fighters"" each with their own characteristic and just one action possible. Again don't expect a full game at all, (it's made by 1 person only) but I thought it's exactly the game that I can enjoy so well on my smartphone while being somewhere out, a short term fun that is still intriguing and offers depth. By combining some rpg/fantasy elements with puzzle. Now of course ItB is a on a whole other level, but the principle of a good genre for me is clear there. I am sad the shop is full of AFK grinder games, or console adaptions that aren't really suit for a small touch screen device aiming to replace consoles or the pc: no. If I am at home I can play better games with better controls possible."
Into the Breach,A touch over the top?
Into the Breach,2:56 sacrifice is not neccesary. into the breach's ai has something that makes sure that you can beat a turn (most of the time) with no mech damage/ grid.
Into the Breach,Bruh you captured the essence of this more than just another indie game so beautifully. Brilliant video
Into the Breach,"""No randomness""... can't really say that. It's literally randomly generated. It's complex dice rolling. They're selling a puzzle that cannot be solved at times..."
Into the Breach,you descrive the soul of this game better then anyone else
Into the Breach,It's on sale this week
Into the Breach,"If hitchhikers guide plays in the background the whole time, I’ll buy it."
Into the Breach,"Thank you for the upload, great game."
Into the Breach,"The game was made by the same people who made FTL: Faster Than Light. Itself a deceptively deep little strategy game with retro 16 bit graphics, a massive sense of urgency and an awesome soundtrack. I'm surprised they haven't released either of these two games for mobile."
Into the Breach,You lost me at rogue like
Into the Breach,Incredible review!
Into the Breach,Don’t think I didn’t notice that background music.
Into the Breach,"Your review is on point. I feel the same about this game. Well done.

I installed it because a round takes 5 min only. Finally a game I have enough time for. I ended up playing all night."
Into the Breach,"Beautiful review! In just under 5 minutes you perfectly encapsulated the little quirks this game has. I picked it up for free on Epic and have been playing it non-stop since! I was surprised to see that such a great review has such a low count of views and likes. Amazing work, keep it up!"
Into the Breach,This game is free next week on Epic games!
Into the Breach,Ur channel is so good man
Into the Breach,Going to play some rocket?
Into the Breach,"*Don't fuckin breathe in the mic*
Now then
This channel is a hidden gem!
Fantastic reviews which are short & filled with relevant gameplay footage
Not saying i would mind if it's 7-10mins though."
Into the Breach,great video! keep it up! :)
Into the Breach,"You are really great at hyping people up for game they would've never heard of before, true talent!"
Into the Breach,"Really loving the quality of these videos, just shows you don't need a massive fan-base to still enjoy creating quality content. Great stuff!"
Into the Breach,"I dont even play most of the games you review. I watch your video because, and I can't stress this enough, they are some of the best video game reviews on youtube. You'll reach 100k in no time."
Into the Breach,what a great compact review! keep em coming!
Into the Breach,"Why the hell do you only have 1.04K subs, man! You're awesome, keep up the great reviews!"
Into the Breach,"How many times have I said this channel is underrated? Uploaded 10 hours ago with only 61 views and 13 likes! This is literally the best game review channel I’ve seen, I just want this guy to get some support Y-y"
Enter the Gungeon,I like how ot clears your inventory after every death. It makes every run feel different. One run you blaze through with a AK-47 and the next you have a t shirt cannon
Enter the Gungeon,eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeenter the gungeon
Enter the Gungeon,why does it matter that there are so many different guns tho? like how different are they
Enter the Gungeon,Finally unlocked the gunslinger
Enter the Gungeon,10/10 review
Enter the Gungeon,I 100 % this game twice
Enter the Gungeon,Just finished it. Amazing!
Enter the Gungeon,Soul knight
Enter the Gungeon,Soul knight?
Enter the Gungeon,"When I first played ETG, I hated it so much because of its difficulty. I tried again and again, but I couldn’t get past the first floor. So, I uninstalled it. Until I decided to reinstall it because why not? I booted it up, and actually got to the second floor. I was incredibly impressed with myself and also relieving. Eventually, I kept making more and more progress to the point where my reflexes were sharper than steel, and I began to appreciate the game more. And then, I went through my first god run. Nothing compares to the amount of dopamine and adrenaline flowing through me during that event. And then, I beat the game (almost, since I died to the boss you fight when you kill a character’s past), and I thought to myself “That….. was fucking awesome.” ETG still holds a special place in my heart to this day. Not only as an amazing experience, not only something that made me like sports (I was bad at sports and hated that, but faster reflexes fixed that issue), but one of my favorite games of all time and the game that got me into my favorite video game genre; roguelikes (Also Hades and Dead Cells)."
Enter the Gungeon,This game makes you feel like America
Enter the Gungeon,Got 4/5 perfect boss fights once then messed up the end... maybe it's time again.
Enter the Gungeon,"truly the first ""gun"" type game"
Enter the Gungeon,I Alien Engine was not created to help you reach your goals.  It was created to destroy your psyche by making you think that shooting backwards and spinning around will help you defeat your enemy
Enter the Gungeon,ETG is the ultimate celebration of video games
Enter the Gungeon,It's like Binding of Isaac but fun
Enter the Gungeon,"Just started playing this game a couple weeks ago.  It's daunting, but addictive affff."
Enter the Gungeon,Merica
Enter the Gungeon,"And the icing on the cake is that when you've finally beaten the game, you're treated to the most sick gamercore music track ever where they rap all of the names of all of the guns you just got done using to conquer the gungeon."
Enter the Gungeon,this game definitely has a massive learning curve but it eventually becomes mind numbingly easy🤣
Enter the Gungeon,I’ve watched this video 100 times and I’ll watch it again
Enter the Gungeon,b u l l e t
Enter the Gungeon,"Halti:they should have added an HWC gun so it can be alongside very awesome guns like ""banana gun"", ""koopa gun"" and the ones mentioned in this video"
Enter the Gungeon,"The game is just too easy, I beat bullet hell the first try I got to it."
Enter the Gungeon,"""Gimmie that gun"""
Enter the Gungeon,Finally. A Sandy Hook video game. About time.
Enter the Gungeon,"Thanks, had this one in my backlog, might dig deeper into this one."
Enter the Gungeon,"Sweet human progress! :O I remember seeing this review back in the day, but I never really thought to actively go try the game out (having not gamed much in recent years, t'all).  But WOW.  Steam had it as free to try for a few days (and only $6 for purchase after that), and I was instantly hooked.  While the game's concept and design are SO incredibly simple, and quite likely just a slight deviation on other existing phone app dungeon crawlers that I've played off and on for years.......it is a masterpiece, no question.  Anything it may have evolved from it has effectively perfected.  Even only being about 5 hrs into gameplay now (and wow, already such a HUGE difference in my skill level) I give this game EASILY an 8.5/10.  Granted, I review it on the basis of its intent and genre: is it gonna have the same level of complexity, graphics, time put in by developers, etc as something like Breath of the Wild?  Obviously not, but it's not trying to be that.  For it's genre, it deserves an 8.5, maybe even 9, out of 10.

I think, in closing, what has to be, by FAR, my favorite element of the game?........you don't directly progress further by just sinking hours into grinding, and you CERTAINLY don't have the option to ""pay to win"".  No, with ""Enter the Gungeon"", your success is measured by your skill level -both one's general, meta gaming talents, as well as specific familiarity with this game's mechanics.  There IS no ""grind mindlessly"" or ""burn your $"" options to win; if you want to win, you have to BE GOOD.   And that is something SO horrifyingly lost in practically all video games in the modern age: you don't have to demonstrate or gain actual talent or skill to win.  WELL, NOT IN ""Enter the Gungeon"" 😃👍"
Enter the Gungeon,When you notice he didn’t kill his past
Enter the Gungeon,"Dude it took you 45 hours to beat it? I've played for 85 and I still haven't reached the dragun 
Edit: I beat it at 120 hours"
Enter the Gungeon,"Enter the Gungeon is one of the best roguelike out there, period. Ps. I suck at this game, I'm too damn old for this shit."
Enter the Gungeon,"My most beloved genre of game is strategy! And then comes RPGs... And then rogue-likes... Which are games who are like,,, rouge... 
I really genuinely feel my greatest achievement in life was platting this game, and doint a zero hit run twice,,, down to the bullet hell area ( the 6th one ) this and the crypt of the necrodancer are a must for everyone <3"
Enter the Gungeon,This is the only game my mom plays on her switch. She’s beaten it 3 times and still plays it
Enter the Gungeon,super fun!
Enter the Gungeon,best Rouglike
Enter the Gungeon,I had never seen footage and literally always thought this was some flash thing related to Jar-Jar Binks. Just realized it’s not Gungan.
Enter the Gungeon,if this this game so good why there IS EXIT the gungeon
Enter the Gungeon,Ok but imagine if this game was knack
Enter the Gungeon,thnk god i beat it in 143 deaths
Enter the Gungeon,"The pilot is the best character, change my mind."
Enter the Gungeon,It has a funny 10/10 also more non important stuff like game play and looks and mechanics but no one cares about that
Enter the Gungeon,YOU SHOULD DO RAIN WORLD
Enter the Gungeon,Ameeerca
Enter the Gungeon,"Im pretty sure this review, which convinced me to buy Gungeon back in late 2020, was the very first stepping stone into liking games that kick my ass. Gungeon, Cuphead, Eldin Ring, all games that I have tons of hours in, despite me knowing they are out of my mental capacity and skill level. Thank you dunkley, for this great review and game recommendation."
Enter the Gungeon,Isaac rebirth is better bisnap tings
Enter the Gungeon,you should play the binding of isaac rebirth
Enter the Gungeon,This was the very next auto-play video after I turned on Enter the Gungeon 🤔
Enter the Gungeon,my favorite gun in the game is the shotgun shell that shoots shotguns that then shoot on impact
Enter the Gungeon,I want to know how to make my steam look like this! 0:07
Enter the Gungeon,You beat the game and didn’t grab the obsidian shell casing first time round… Oh I feel so sorry for you.
Enter the Gungeon,"I first learned about enter the gungeon from this video back in 2020, I've sunk over 600 hours into enter the gungeon and enjoyed every second of it. Thanks for recommending this amazing game dunkey, I still come back to this video every once in a while to reminisce"
Enter the Gungeon,Lower case r combined with explosive rounds is my favorite
Enter the Gungeon,This game should be called enter the pungeon
Enter the Gungeon,"Yo, i remember have seeing a steam forum about asking for an ""easy mode"", the funny thing is, that, at that time I was having trouble with the freaking punch-out rat battle, but bro, a few attempts (more or less 5 days later) I could defeated him, even getting 5 keys. ETG is not about being a master at the game, it is about how you face the trouble you go through to finally master the game"
Enter the Gungeon,I prefer issac
Enter the Gungeon,Dude your excuse for hating this game is that you’re bad.
Enter the Gungeon,"Gungeon is the second most played game I own, just shy of Pokémon Pearl, but that gap is closing fast. Gungeon is the most fun with a game I’ve had in so long and going back even after something like 200 wins and 600 some-odd deaths feels as natural to me as breathing. It’s fun, it’s hard, it’s a little broken, and it’s a blast to play."
Enter the Gungeon,"""This game is just straight up fucking horseshit"" *proceeds to go on about how awesome the game is for 3 minutes*"
Enter the Gungeon,"Played it for over 30 hours and couldn't get pass Level 2.

Fuck this game; would play it again."
Enter the Gungeon,git gud lmaoo
Enter the Gungeon,You think when those bullet enemies die they go to bullet Hell?
Enter the Gungeon,This game is criminally underrated. Dunkey's the only big YouTuber to talk about it.
Enter the Gungeon,450 hours in is still so much fun
Enter the Gungeon,You forgot to mention that the intro song makes you wanna throw it back and bust a move on these hoes. So returning to this game is always hype.
Enter the Gungeon,"Dunk, you need to do the Binding of Isaac"
Enter the Gungeon,"Gonna have to get this for a Destiny 2 fan I know, I'll tell him it's an amazing looter-shooter."
Enter the Gungeon,I have played this game for 100s of hours and have not beat it
Enter the Gungeon,"I've owned this game for 3 years and still haven't beaten it. I got all the way to the Dragun once, lost.....got out of my chair and fell to my knees while screaming, ""WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME LORD, AM I NOT WORTHY?!?!""

Narrator - ""He was not worthy.""

No joke though, I'm trying again this weekend. This game is......this game is my thunderdome. 
10/10"
Enter the Gungeon,I’m working on trying to unlock the gunslinger Been playing for years now
Enter the Gungeon,This reminds me of soul knight
Enter the Gungeon,Hey dude Play mini militia
Enter the Gungeon,Anybody know the song at the end of this video?
Enter the Gungeon,There are more polished indie games like hollow knight and hades but enter the gungeon just places number one in my heart. The sheer volume of contents this game offers truly makes every run different than the last.
Enter the Gungeon,I have played this game for over 100 hours and still haven't beat it
Enter the Gungeon,I remember getting a pistol that shot shotguns that exploded into more bullets.  Such a good game.
Enter the Gungeon,How many years will this take off my life?
Enter the Gungeon,Awesome game 😊😊
Enter the Gungeon,Mf bought roll bomb over stout bullets 🤦‍♂️
Enter the Gungeon,It's CRIMINAL this game doesn't have a sequel using SNES graphics. I know we got exit the gungeon but it's not the same
Enter the Gungeon,"I like this game, I need to play it again soon! Great review"
Enter the Gungeon,"I remember playing this with a friend of mine, and we ended up finding a secret shop that took us to a glitch type boss, which we somehow beat while both of us were still alive. I don't remember much after that as we were drinking quite a bit but I think the game ended after that...not sure as it was kinda hazy."
Enter the Gungeon,you know whats best then tgis game is soul knight baby
Enter the Gungeon,I just recently started playing this on pc with keyboard and I couldn't get past the first chamber for a week. A few months later and I've killed everyones past :T so maybe its not toooo hard. But it is in fact a great game. I hated it but now I love it loll
Enter the Gungeon,Bert from Tremors would be fucking proud
Enter the Gungeon,When is dunkey going to review exit the gungeon!!!
Enter the Gungeon,I wanted to try this out because I like isaac but yeaaaaaahhh I suck at isaac I maybe shouldn't get hooked on another Rouge like
Enter the Gungeon,MaSta peace
Enter the Gungeon,Classic.
Enter the Gungeon,This video ages like fine wine for me. I still go back to it every now and again
Enter the Gungeon,I totally wanna play this because of the mega man content. It seems really dun
Enter the Gungeon,"If you like enter the gungeon, I think you'll like The Binding of Isaac too.

it's much easier than this game, but it also has a special charm too it just like this game"
Enter the Gungeon,I’ve played the game for 3 hours straight ITS ABSOLUTE FUCKING BULLSHIT. I LOVE THIS GAME AND HATE IT
Enter the Gungeon,This video made me fall in love with something I didn't realize i would while also getting closer to my brother and spending hours upon hours high trying to beat the game. Going from struggling to beat it to beating it multiple times and still play it till this day with over 160 hours.
Enter the Gungeon,"damnit, KUndey why you so relatable?"
Enter the Gungeon,I’m still surprised he hasn’t reviewed Binding of Issac yet.
Enter the Gungeon,I love you man my you do my black grandmas proud
Enter the Gungeon,When a video game review is done after beating the whole game by a reviewer who is capable of playing and appreciating the difficulty
Enter the Gungeon,This game makes you feel like you are kyle rittenhouse
Enter the Gungeon,He says the game if F*cking Horse Sh*t but then he talks about how awesome the game is
Enter the Gungeon,thank you for giving me the soundtrack at the end. now i listen to it constantly
Enter the Gungeon,On sale right now for 5.99 on Xbox marketplace
Enter the Gungeon,b
Enter the Gungeon,Wtf how's the conclusion at the end anything close to the whole review
Enter the Gungeon,"people are triggered with the ""some boring guns"" huh"
Enter the Gungeon,I’m gonna take a guess that the *boring guns* are just the real ones
Enter the Gungeon,"You could literally say ""some boring guns"" is a con for just about every modern shooter"
Enter the Gungeon,So fun to watch someone review a game whilst fighting a giant bullet hell lead skull... and the player uses a banana!
Enter the Gungeon,"Cons: 

tedious and monotonous gameplay
slow pace
shitty guns
useless items

Pros (only if you're a casual player):

easy difficulty"
Enter the Gungeon,400
Enter the Gungeon,Idk what you guys are complaining about this review. They gave it a 8.5 and called it great.
Enter the Gungeon,Free on PSN right now.
Enter the Gungeon,"PROS: CRAZY GUNS

CONS: BORING GUNS"
Enter the Gungeon,At the moment this game is free for all with or without PlayStation Plus grab it while you can next month we get zero Dawn the complete edition for free
Enter the Gungeon,Didn't know about this game until the free version on playstation 😭
Enter the Gungeon,Who's here cause it's free on PSN?
Enter the Gungeon,some boring guns? GET IT OUT OF HERE ! 8.5 for u
Enter the Gungeon,Who saw this recommend after the free playstation games announced ?
Enter the Gungeon,"Whose here after knowing Enter the Gungeon will be free as part of Play at Home Initiative. Coming this spring, starting March 25— 10 games will drop as free, so you may wanna check that out."

Enter the Gungeon,"Why’d they choose a dude that’s terrible at the game, he tap shot the mega hand"
Enter the Gungeon,8.5? You didn't say one bad thing about the game
Enter the Gungeon,"By boring guns I assume he means regular guns. Well duh. At least SOME of the guns have to resemble actual guns. I wouldn't like the game if it just had all fun, gimmicky guns. I feel like this game has the perfect balance of gimmicks and actual just skill based guns. That's not a con it's a pro."
Enter the Gungeon,You don't know anything do you IGN? Lol
Enter the Gungeon,"Guys you shouldn’t care about igns review 
There bad"
Enter the Gungeon,noobs reviewing difficult games are like:
Enter the Gungeon,guitar tuner
Enter the Gungeon,“Some boring guns” proceeds to show a clip of a gun that is a banana that explodes into more smaller bananas that also explode and destroy enemy bullets
Enter the Gungeon,fun fact: you can defeat some bosses with the marine sidearm. i did that once (smiley and shades however)
Enter the Gungeon,i could defeat the trigger twins wwith marine sidearm. i did that once
Enter the Gungeon,It's a 10. One of the best games ever.
Enter the Gungeon,Don’t think I didn’t notice you don’t have any floor 5 footage. Yeah I caught you.
Enter the Gungeon,Just got this free on Epic Games Launcher! It's addictive.
Enter the Gungeon,"IGN: starts the video with a gun that shoots out bananas.
Also IGN: ""boring guns"" as a CON.
Me: ""Say what now?"""
Enter the Gungeon,I am just here finding out what I got for free on EpicGames...
Enter the Gungeon,Hi This Is free on epic.Who is here like me to watch how is the game
Enter the Gungeon,Who's here after it will be free on EPIC GAMES STORE ?

Enter the Gungeon,ItS tOo HaRd FoR mE 3/10
Enter the Gungeon,"well, i have not played enter the gungeon when it came out"
Enter the Gungeon,what character do you like to play as in this game?
Enter the Gungeon,Top 2 game
Enter the Gungeon,Amazing that this review was 4 years ago. Nice to know that ign is still the same group of turds dishing out misinformation til this today.
Enter the Gungeon,hehe disARMING
Enter the Gungeon,a 8.5 for some boring guns this is why i dont trust IGN reviews
Enter the Gungeon,I think they didn’t finish the game
Enter the Gungeon,7.5/10 - Too many boring guns.
Enter the Gungeon,"Anyone else Looking for the ""Who's here after watching Exit the Gungeon"" comments?"
Enter the Gungeon,In the end Enter the Gungeon really makes you feel like Gungeon
Enter the Gungeon,You just didn't want to give the game a 10/10 so you made up a con
Enter the Gungeon,"How are boring guns a con?
Also I disagree every gun is fun to play with and their not BORING"
Enter the Gungeon,“Boring guns” litterally a gun where you throw pillows using a pillow
Enter the Gungeon,Some boring guns ur the worst ign
Enter the Gungeon,"Keepin' it IGN'y, IGN. Would've been disappointed if this wasn't a substanceless review."
Enter the Gungeon,They lost a point and a half for boring guns LMAO 😂😂😂 IGN logic at its best.
Enter the Gungeon,"8.5 out of 10
Cons: some boring guns
Nothing else
CoD Ghosts: 8.8 out of 10
They only have simple guns
What?"
Enter the Gungeon,Watch dunkey's review of Enter the Gungeon
Enter the Gungeon,I love it how there is no gameplay form the 5th-6th floors or any secret falls telling me ign didt even bother to beat the game before they made a review on ot
Enter the Gungeon,"I only played a few runs, but I'm not feeling it.  The gameplay is fine, but I don't feel an urge to keep going.  I'll give a proper run before I make up my mind though."
Enter the Gungeon,America in a gunshell
Enter the Gungeon,"8.5 out of 10 guns that are meant to be boring are boring 
Do you know what synergy is?
Did you even beat the game once?"
Enter the Gungeon,this deserves 9.5 . just removing points because you didnt like the guns is not something very professional to do.
Enter the Gungeon,"If you want an insane op gun, just shoot the shop dude."
Enter the Gungeon,"Nobody:

IGN: ""Some boring guns 8.5/10"""
Enter the Gungeon,"Didn't even mention the curse system, or the synchronized system between items and guns that upgrades both, or the hidden boss system, or the mini-challenges; none whatsoever about the difficulty of getting all 4 items in separate runs to get to the final boss, or the hidden boss. 
Truly, a very shallow review. Gungeon offers so much more than just a simple rogue-like crossed with dungeon shooter."
Enter the Gungeon,Some boring guns more like Fun Guns
Enter the Gungeon,Who came from epic games
Enter the Gungeon,This game is trash. Stay away and thank me later.
Enter the Gungeon,"Crazy guns- Some boring guns,




*petfectly balanced as all things should be*"
Enter the Gungeon,He said SOME boring guns. You can obviously see that he wrote crazy guns in the pros section.
Enter the Gungeon,But I dont have a left thumb or arm in fact I have a 1 handed switch controller tho its incredible
Enter the Gungeon,8.5/8.5
Enter the Gungeon,This shows the kind of hypocrisy their reviews have
Enter the Gungeon,"""some boring guns""



boy have you even played this game?"
Enter the Gungeon,Nuclear Throne was underated...
Enter the Gungeon,"8.5 some boring guns


What the hell IGN"
Enter the Gungeon,"""Some boring guns""

Microtransaction gun: *exists*

*ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?*"
Enter the Gungeon,Worst review! only con BORING GUNS!!! If it was me I would give it a 10/10
Enter the Gungeon,What does rogue or rogue-like as a genre mean?
Enter the Gungeon,Nope 11/10 it’s literally perfect
Enter the Gungeon,"s o m e 
b o r i n g
g u n s

Still makes me laugh even after 2 years"
Enter the Gungeon,"Here’s a question, how many guns did you use? There are around 700 guns in Gungeon and I don’t think you can say boring guns without using them all."
Enter the Gungeon,Coming to switch?
Enter the Gungeon,"8.5 ""Too Many Guns"""
Enter the Gungeon,this game is really difficult
Enter the Gungeon,"Some guns are really f-ing boring, guys. Is that for real that you don't agree? Some of them actually spoils the run and make no sense."
Enter the Gungeon,"Let it be known after 2 years of this review up, they got 130k views. While dunkeys came out 3 weeks ago and got over a million views. IGN needs to hire ACTUAL people who know games."
Enter the Gungeon,In the example he's showing for the bad gun he has a ton more guns in his slots why not use the other ones... and in some places you can sacrifice guns for that reason. Some guns are obviously better than others.
Enter the Gungeon,Celeste or welcome to the gungeon
Enter the Gungeon,"""Some boring guns""?

So... the ones that are supposed to be bad?"
Enter the Gungeon,bullet fetish
Enter the Gungeon,"""Some boring guns"" is he serious.
That has to be a joke,how the hell can that be justified.
I mean that's like giving a restaurant bad reviews because it had some dishes you didn't like.
There is literally no justification for taking away 1.5 points for ""some boring guns""."
Enter the Gungeon,im guessing the boring guns are the starting guns b/c starting weapons are never interesting
Enter the Gungeon,"I absolutely love this game, it’s very difficult mind you"
Enter the Gungeon,"I loved this game, but what I hated was dying and losing all the progress you made, I wish there was an easy option so I don't have to do 10 minutes of trudging through the minions on just one level again to have another go of beating the level. I understand some like this, so if it could have a difficulty setting to switch it off then it'd be perfect for me."
Enter the Gungeon,Of course. 8.5/10
War Thunder,"Play War Thunder now with my link, and get a massive, free bonus pack including vehicles, boosters, and more: https://playwt.link/ssethtzwt2022"
War Thunder,"I’ve played this game for few years for a single purpose of trying out the jets.

And when the grind was about done, Gaijin hit me with an update adding 3 more variations of the exact same plane right before the jet I wanted and almost had. Actually making me grind for more exp than I’ve already earned in this tech tree. So I quit. Period.

The grind is immense, I’d go as far as to say it’s worse than warframe, worse than genshin, I hate it, everyone hates it. The game itself, however, is great and fun"
War Thunder,"I remember the time, when my dad (mid 40s) got into war thunder. He's a workaholic and hasn't played a video game since I were a baby, but somehow he got into this one. Usually, he got obliterated and rage quitted, but came back to the game the next day. It was funny hearing him shittalking from the next room. I'm Polish btw.

And hooray for neurodivergence self acceptance, I'm slowly getting there too."
War Thunder,"Your way with words is something incredible. What you say sounds extremely written to perfection and/or efficacy. I skip like 10 or 20 seconds of your video looking for a specific bit and BAM! holy shit, this is the vore part it's like i went back in time... wasn't this 3 minutes ago? So then I scroll to the right a little and it's something absolutely off topic that comes back on track JUST TO TELL ME IM OFF ON THE TIMING. like a bible, in order to truly understand you need to read it chronologically; from start to finish. Otherwise you won't understand it.

In conclusion: your videos are truly affectionate, funny and lovable. While also cryptic and bible-like (as in also that you need to re-read it in order to understand MORE of the things you missed, even though it was right in your face the whole time and you will swear to yourself that you read it even though you did but your mind didn't understand it the first time and will pretend it didn't even perceive it, act of arrogance. But, that is a topic for another time;) for now keep doing what youre doing."

War Thunder,Never start playing this game. It has something addictive but you'll waste your time in trying to climb tech trees. It has no interest. This game is unbalanced and has only low fun. Do not pay this game if you don't want to Subsidizen China or Russia.
War Thunder,You said as well
War Thunder,Hey thanks for reminding me to fix posture
War Thunder,6:52 someone did it https://youtu.be/w7ZbqwnAM3k
War Thunder,Music during the montage bit at the end?
War Thunder,"A Korean man decided to try and jump out of a commercial flight not too long ago, guess they must have taken this video to heart."
War Thunder,God tier review
War Thunder,"Don't mind me, just strolling by to watch the ending montage at max volume for the 111th time."
War Thunder,REVIEW: Fear & Hunger
War Thunder,"I was in a dogfight, repeated the 2023 Drone-Gopnik black sea collision for the memes. Ended up bending all of my propellers. Ivan went back and landed in his babushkas potato garden while I just glided and landed in some field. I got credit for his death, he did not get credit for mine. Great success!"
War Thunder,Shout out to the man who profited from both sides lmao
War Thunder,"I still say this game is pay to win. I baught premium for a month and my planes are way more aerodynamic. I still get shot down but by the decade players, but i make it - that much harder on them"
War Thunder,'ping 109' *laughs in New Zealand*
War Thunder,【Sunglasses Finnish Pirates】Tom of Finland gay male pictures xD Remember to say Amen after prayer :) I prayed with you
War Thunder,"I'm kinda confused... You JUST said that the game is totally free, but then you're giving out links that will give people free stuff. Sooo... The game is free but the thing you're giving out isn't? So much confusion, so little time..."
War Thunder,Cute and funny lover 😭😭😭
War Thunder,"Probably the best time to play war thunder rn and the best time for Sseth and everyone else to realize that the system is designed to reduce you into the ink that charts the line going up

Edit: also glad you’re trying to buck your addiction that shit is never easy especially when it’s to a medicine that is supposed to make your brain work a certain way"
War Thunder,"14:57: in warthunder you dont have teammates, you only have enemies on blue, and cannon fodder"
War Thunder,"Hm, no ™ in the title?"
War Thunder,Its been like 4 people leaking documents over warthunder now
War Thunder,"""It takes years to properly develop Stockholm Syndrome"" should be the motto of this video and the game."
War Thunder,Realistic This is BS most people paly realistic also realistic has different physics it's nothing like arcade flyings
War Thunder,"I’ve been playing 7 years and fully agree with everything. This is an amazing blend of honesty, humor, and very based memes"
War Thunder,"Oh sigh, if this video had come out any more recently it could have had jokes about the missile knowing where it is. Things can only be so perfect, though, it seems."
War Thunder,sad they take away your accounts
War Thunder,i play realistic and im not nice
War Thunder,Im so glad im off xanex
War Thunder,"Man that ending was such a good montage. Hella good editing.
Hope you are doing better my man."
War Thunder,3:12 why you show an mBank card bruh
War Thunder,algorithm comment. have fun
War Thunder,"I'm addicted to cigarettes, caffeine, masturbating, porn, video games, have a poor work ethic, eat nothing but junk food, and my hygiene is shit."
War Thunder,I think… this is the video Seth turned based
War Thunder,"from 9:20 to 10:00 

you are right on the money about any of those games, do the same in gta online and soon you will realise just how pathetic everyone is with their uber expensive items when they get themself exploded by the oppressor's while you are trucking along, having a great time exploring the un-seen area of the poor section of san andreas....no joke, its so much more fun that way, 

you get more choice on what vehicule you want from how little you spent on housing and if you really want a nice car, go for it, its not gonna hurt you in the long run as you can resell it unlike housing lol


but IRL and in game, do that, you will never be out of money if you keep what you need to low"
War Thunder,"That ending tho, reignited my dreams of being a jet pilot"
War Thunder,11:35 is that Steve Buscemi? 🤣
War Thunder,Please Seth I'm begging you review cruelty squad I Pinky promise you won't regret it at least look at a trailer for it
War Thunder,GRRRRRRRRRAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH TJIS GAME FUCKING SUUUUUUUUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!
War Thunder,"Sseth’s sudden rant truly felt like it was from the heart. I especially love the line “I’m sorry I never read the fine print of my birth, but I never signed up for this shit.” That shit fucking spoke to me, man! I know that frustration!"
War Thunder,Γαμάτο
War Thunder,"russian is developers of this game, so.. i wouldnt recommend u to play this"
War Thunder,This man has to be a government sleeper agent just trying to awaken himself.
War Thunder,"God I remember playing this on shit wifi, it was a fever dream"
War Thunder,"seth's decent is exactly how i feel going off ADD meds after 10+ years of using it, i relate and my withdrawal is abysmal"
War Thunder,"Excellent review, very honest."
War Thunder,"*calls AIM-9C all aspect IR missile* 
me: *dies*"
War Thunder,This is art.
War Thunder,Play realistic scum bag
War Thunder,womanrespectter420 ahahahaha
War Thunder,Natural predators of Chinese is escalators had tears streaming from my eyes
War Thunder,Imagine getting paid to play arcade mode.
War Thunder,"I used to be addicted to Xanax, and I can 100% confirm, it’s 0/10 a very bad time"
War Thunder,"The servers are garbage I play on fibre gigabit and my packet loss is over 50, no other game is like this is amazing to see my plane just ufo into the ground."
War Thunder,thanks seth
War Thunder,"Arcade is mid, you are wrong, say gex"
War Thunder,5:48 exactly the same? You mean besides the 50% increase to horse power? Or the names over everyones tank?
War Thunder,Sseth just singlehandedly convinced me that the whole idea of flight is nothing but a scam🤣🤣🤣
War Thunder,I wish someone would've told me gaslighting wasn't real before I heard about it. Now I can focus my mind on what truly matters... pretending to be a woman on Christian Mingle.
War Thunder,apparently Gaijin also directly funds pro-russian terrorist groups in Ukraine .
War Thunder,"WarThunder ia maybe the most advanced game in existence. It's also the most grindy, greedy and addictive one. It will suck your life and your wallet away if you let it. Do yourself a favour and just don't start playing it"
War Thunder,I NEED THE YAKUB SKIN
War Thunder,2:33 isnt that from hamajineo
War Thunder,There is a better game called whorethunder
War Thunder,16:49 This montage made me start playing and I entered the rabbit hole
War Thunder,War thunder soundtrack 🤤
War Thunder,2:44 is too great
War Thunder,Love it. It sos spot on😂
War Thunder,This video is too good it should be banned.
War Thunder,Is it quicker to develop Stockholm syndrome by using rickety Swedish planes?
War Thunder,i thought i was watching a war thunder video
War Thunder,Came to listen to someone’s opinion on war thunder left feeling like I’m trapped in a prison of my own drug addiction :(
War Thunder,When you grind just to unlock a jet fighter and die first time out in it. Love this game.
War Thunder,love u baby
War Thunder,...... I feel exceptionally called out considering I play american tanks and all I can think is how much I hate the t34 and kv tanks
War Thunder,My man didn't cover naval combat. I was waiting for some anime references
War Thunder,"man whenever i play realistic my gun jams, and when i try and go back to base, i get shot down by either a bf-109, a p-400, or some jap plane"
War Thunder,My school teachers in like grade 5 tried to prescribe me riddalin because I had temper tantrums. Thankfully my dad told them off for that.
War Thunder,Some of the best editing I've seen ...strongs bro
War Thunder,"I'm the person in the ""yacht"". I'm there stealing the capture points to win the game and.launching torps and anti ship missiles into your ass. I'm not sorry, and neither are you. Me killing you after giving my team a massive lead is pure profit. You nuking me easily is just the price. Of course, I play RB because I'm not a filthy casual... Just a slighter cleaner one."
War Thunder,Unironically I began looking into where the ammo was for a lot of tanks ever since I played a game with an L3/33 and killed a T-28 Heavy tank with it.
War Thunder,War Funder
War Thunder,Realistic is the best mode and isnt only for tryhards
War Thunder,"Do you talk like ambiguous amphibian, or the other way around?"
War Thunder,"Oh... My... God

HE IS RIGHT"
War Thunder,"I want to believe the community is silly
But I still just don't believe that

I think that gta 5 is more silly and more affordable because it only has 1 form of currency in gta"
War Thunder,I’m glad Sseth has finally opened my eyes to the truth about flying.
War Thunder,me: quitting and relapsing and quitting and relapsing over and over again
War Thunder,"12:41 Well, this is relevant now."
War Thunder,"What happened to the World of Tanks Video? Not that I don’t rewatch this one enough as is, but I was just trying to rewatch it and can’t find it."
War Thunder,"Warthunder no fun anymore...maps changed , no good sniping spots , no need for mapknowlegde anymore, no shots through weak wood houses, no golden wager anymore,,,,game total boring now and waste of time"
War Thunder,The world of tank video is gone. God bless you Sseth
War Thunder,mfw arcade is already more realistic than WoT
War Thunder,"Heh, you warned me now when it was too late Sseth, I’m already consumed by War Thunder, evidence of action is the amount of coffee and weed consumed to keep myself heightened for my eyes to work better, and reflexes to twitch easier"
War Thunder,"I know it's pretty short for a review, but I still think I managed a brief synopsis of most aspects. The title is borrowed from Shammy's ""Actual Review of"" series. I asked for his permission before using the naming scheme.
Shammy: https://www.youtube.com/user/HIIMCAPSLOCK
Taff: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdFVRKRg9ZI-mgFfuMhfQxQ"
War Thunder,"The game is basically a scam. It's just a point and click shooter, with pay2win options, that relies heavily on volumetric marketing. They don't need to present a good product - just the bare minimum that enough people will spend money on it. It's a few models - some basic maps, and boom you have something that 'looks like' enough of a game - but it really isn't."
War Thunder,"Thanks to try to bring us back to this shit game, just to ruin our life a little more with your crap game."
War Thunder,"They don't give a fuck about review. Like they never did. Even Q&A happens the most retardic way. They write comments on their own, with absolutely IDIOTIC questions, and some of their own replies to it. Fucktastic... who cares about fucking shading on tiger's chassis, or what kind of classical songs they played on the back...."
War Thunder,"I've literally heard that mic drop ... 
I know video is like 2 yr old, and I don't even play WT that long, before I've discovered WT, I've played WOT for about 5 years. And all I want to say is ""I  love War Thunder "" BDW Heyyyy, nobody is perfect 😂"
War Thunder,Almost fun to play sounds exactly like escape from tarkov
War Thunder,"Halo CE music in WT, my man!"
War Thunder,"Probably the most difficult game to get into i’ve ever played, the controls menu is baffling 

wait the game has ships?"
War Thunder,We need Max0r to do a review
War Thunder,"War thunder seems fun to watch other people play, but insufferable to play myself"
War Thunder,I have a b r a i n   i n j u r y
War Thunder,"Im downloaded War thunder a couple days ago and I dont really like grinding, I feel no fun in it and all it feels like is a grind or repetitive ☹️"
War Thunder,"Fuck that. This game is terrible and Gaijin studios is a travesty.

Everything about this game is designed to get you to spend money and give the least incentive to actually play as possible. This game shouldn't be recommended."
War Thunder,100% pay to win game
War Thunder,"Eh this crap isnt fun, there's way too much grinding and rven the gameplay is boring. If you want a tank game, go play world of tankd/blitz"
War Thunder,War Thunder would be a great game if the devs would seriously do something about the massive number of cheaters in the game. They don't care as long as they get their money.
War Thunder,"If you r not successful in the game, get some practice and dont cry. This video seems to me like crying cos you always loose.."
War Thunder,"As a player that has put more than 40 hours into the game, yet haven't made it past BR 3.0, it came as a very annoying and frustrating realisation that you couldn't play several kinds of nations in a match.
Having to switch nations every time you want to play a different tank is unimaginative and tedious. And as a ""new"" player, having played the game after a year or more of pause, finding out that I'd made it so far in the German tanks while crying through the British (because I couldn't remember what I had played) was annoying.

I'm a recovering WoT player, so not having all tanks readily available was weird. Not sure the two games are comparable at all, though.

In terms of learning the game, the test drives are god awful. Tip and tricks are only for the VERY basic ""this is how you fire, this is how you move"" level, things like training AA requires a complete test drive restart if you dont kill the plane immediately, and the same with fighter planes. And what's the point of learning to bomb, if the targets don't respawn? After the friendly AA guns, you're all out of targets.

And gameplay-wise, being oneshot by things you can't see is a really hard pill to swallow, just like when your shots aimed at the centre of the enemy doesn't kill them. Tutorials on aiming in general are abysmal, and more often than not I was searching the internet for explanations on what the ammunitions did, where to shoot, why regular tanks shoot down more planes than AA, and so on.

The game is a low 6/10. If it wasn't because I genuinely wanted to play it and be better, I'd just given up and uninstalled it. It is a massive game, after all.
It looks nice, sure, but getting a total of 4 minutes of action across 3 tanks is rarely worth it. Why is it that spawn protection isn't a thing? And if it is, why isn't it explained ANYWHERE? I should NEVER be allowed to just find a hull-down position just behind enemy spawn, where I can farm all the kills, that is simply not good gameplay.

And speaking of not good gameplay, why on God's Barren Globe does it cost premium currency to put stickers, decals, BUSHES on the tank? It's bad enough to be tempted with the potential earnings with premium account, and seeing all the premium vehicles, but something as basic as bushes?? They give a massive advantage, not to mention the base ""camo"" of nations working for different maps.
Why does all nations not just have a basic orange, basic white, and basic green camo for those maps?"
War Thunder,"To me, the game that deals with that ""classical music in modern times"" problem is Project Reality. It's also completely F2P and every map theme fits PERFECTLY, not to mention being absolute bangers. Ig it kinda makes sense since the game started of as a BF2 mod, which also had amazing music."
War Thunder,"watching this while downloading warthunder, I hope my pc doesn't melt with this game"
War Thunder,"the thing that makes an online game shit hardly ever lies with the game, but with the players that play it. There are so many scum playing this game it hardly makes it any fun.
Such as spawn camping, sure there is no spawn camping penalty, thats bad on the games part, but the sheer amount of pathetic players who see spawn camping as a legitimate thing is ruining it. Then there is these russian tanks, namely the t-34 & kv-1, they are historically incorrectly powerful in their canons, and they are fast and very often take no damage if the right spot is not hit makes them monsters, since this is so op, the majority of players play these monsters, spawning at that. and if they dont, they take premium planes and camp you afterwards. Sure players could choose to play non-op tanks, but the choice they make contributes actively to why this game is inbalanced. Then the maps, some maps are heavily favoring one side and disfavors the other, since it takes so much longer to go upward a slop, its unbelievable that noone took an inbalance into account when the enemy team can constantly shoot you from high ground. Again the players who shoot directly at the spawn ruin this, despite the fact that the game developers DID NOT EVEN LEARN SHIT FROM BATTLEFIELD 1942 FROM 20 YEARS AGO."
War Thunder,"I like blowing up other players, that why I play War Thunder. cause Kaboom."
War Thunder,"An abusive marriage, heroine addiction, McDonalds, undiagnosed pathological selfloathing... all of that comes to mind."
War Thunder,i have fun in war thunder but thats because i don't play realistic
War Thunder,To be honest I am playing to unlock instead of unlocking as I am playing
War Thunder,B-But the 'game' is not FreeToPlay... I-Its not
War Thunder,"To sum this up... ""I play only premium vehicles, and am sponsored to do so.""

What this game really needs is a honest brutal FTP experience review. That tells people the truth that aging this game is nowhere near worth it."
War Thunder,"War thunder is rigged in favour of premium player.  When you have  a tank directly in your sight lit green and all and your gun doesn't fire, you're up against a premium player. When your shot causes a critical hit or no damage at all and your opponent in the same tank using the same rounds takes you out with one shot, you're up against a premium player."
War Thunder,War thunder: play for 87 hours to unlock one vehicle *also please buy our premium*
War Thunder,I forgot this game had sound. played it for hundreds of hours but muted the in-game music right away for either silence or my own tunes
War Thunder,"I really wish that there was a competetor of war thunder, fulfilling its wrongs."
War Thunder,"I'd really love a new players guide to wt.
Picked it up and have been working my way through British tanks but I unlocked the valentine and it's painfully slow lol"
War Thunder,Summary: good game bad company
War Thunder,"spookston did a whole review about the music -_-









































































was that necessary?"
War Thunder,The game takes too long I'm still stuck on the starter of vehicles and I've been playing for a year
War Thunder,War thunder *isnt* a fun game. It just has *fun moments*
War Thunder,"To any new players the best advice I can give is don't play this game. 
I've played this game back when it was just planes to now. I can honestly say this game will only frustrat you or milk you for money. 
Poor balance, shity player base, expensive monacisation and a overall bad experience. God forbid you ask for somthing to get fixed because it'll never happen. It took them 8 years to add a ammo counter for your coaxial MG. And they still haven't added any new game modes to the game in 9 years. No AI helicopter battles don't count"

War Thunder,"Gonna start playing WT with my brother (for fun)

Hope we can have a ton ot fun without running hard into the annoying stuff 

:)"
War Thunder,"gajins ui has always been bad, it doesnt matter what you do."
War Thunder,ill jsut stick to wot ig
War Thunder,"""I forgot about Naval, but so did Gaijin.""

Infantry: ""You forgot another important thing."
War Thunder,"Shitty UI, insanely long grinding, pay-to-win, occasional inaccuracies that make no sense even for gameplay (APHE should NOT have better penetration than solid AP), helicopters that can survive tank shells, and Gaijin changing stats constantly for no good reason. It doesn't sound great, to be honest."
War Thunder,Do not get this game. Amazing concept executed like 19th century capitalism. Just miserable.
War Thunder,"My daily ritual of self abuse is War Thunder, mostly aviation. While I have level V jets for Brit, USSR, Germany, I find myself playing Level III or IV mostly, grinding for SL or RP to buy and unlock the next plane. Cost of repair is just too damn high beyond those levels! While the game can be a frustrating slog most days, last night I got a 'Hero Of The Sky' award that was a quite satisfying round at Level III. That's the shit that keeps me coming back for more abuse. As they say, 'Self flagellation is the ultimate revenge'."
War Thunder,"I genuinely have lost pretty much all hope for war thunder turning into anything remotely fun. Playing certainly feels like a chore with most grinds coming to literal crawls which is likely on me(I am definitely one of the worst players and I have not improved in the 7 years I’ve been playing.) however, it has fun moments in the single victories I have in every 15 matches I play. I still can’t believe I had so much fun with war thunder at one point that I put the time in to get the is-3 which is objectively the least rewarding tank in the game"

War Thunder,"“Hey spookstoon, you forgot about naval!”
“Yeah, so did gaijin” 🤣🤣🤣"
War Thunder,I can't beleive that you talked about war thunder music without mentioning Italy.
War Thunder,2:17 I love the US defeat theme so much
War Thunder,"To be honest it’s like eating your favorite meal everyday, sometimes you need a break but when you come back it is so good"
War Thunder,"That last line burned so hard, you worked for this sub brother. Thank you."
War Thunder,"On the sound aspect, it changed a lot."
War Thunder,7:14  halo 3 odst soundtrack hits me very hard🥺
War Thunder,That closing line made me laugh out loud.
War Thunder,coc
War Thunder,"I can only afford to play as high as 3.7rb br
As far as I'm concerned 
The maps are the worst part of the game... by a long shot."
War Thunder,"How to have fun in WT
Play and have fun
After you start losing
Take a small break, maybe like
1 or 2 hours
Then rinse and repeat
It helps me out so much"
War Thunder,nice joke at the end
War Thunder,War thunder is like communism. Better when it was thought of
War Thunder,Naval is actually really calming ngl
War Thunder,"3:15 all i heard when i was watching was ""Preserving Freedom!"" and ""We fight for peace!"""
War Thunder,"""It's free to play, you dont have anything to lose""

meanwhile my sanity:"
War Thunder,"4:30

Cries in R3 T20"
War Thunder,"The high fidelity update is now out and every veichle has better results skins,now we just need updated models, which would tanke forever"
War Thunder,7:12 OH DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANG
War Thunder,3:49 oh you mean the updates that take over half an hour just to fix something i and many players could not give less s**ts about?
War Thunder,"""You have nothing to lose"" 
Me who lost 500 hours of his life: Are you sure about that?"
War Thunder,"In my opinion, this game is for smart people willing to challenge their brains lol"
War Thunder,The most hardest game and headache game ever!!!
War Thunder,3:07 i thought I was the only person that remembers command and conquer
War Thunder,"The name ""Gaijin"" suits the company well."
War Thunder,What a way to end the video!
War Thunder,"ill give you a review, its a rip off shit! you dont get enough lions or rp to repair the vehicles you have purchased unless you buy premium"
War Thunder,dogshiiiiiit
War Thunder,"i think this game is the worst fucking garbage i have ever seen in my life,stupid garbage shitt fcking disgustingly confusing for new players"
War Thunder,"One year after video upload and what changed you ask Me? Not a single thing, after playing this game for 10years they did not add not a single mode"
War Thunder,after playing for like 100 hours Im still confused with the settings. There is like 1 million option. They should really make it more simple and put the more important settings easier to find
War Thunder,so today at the very start of the match i activated a order and t was over instanly and said some guy got it when we have not even lifted off the air field
War Thunder,"I didn't really get how bad WT UI is until I left the game for a year, and when I come back I couldn't figure out how it works, lol
Ps. Seriously, WTF with camo bushed, and it's P2W factor. It's just stupid."
War Thunder,When i started playing after moving from world of tanks console i was confused how the br system and tech tree worked
War Thunder,War Thunder's War Thunder Problem
War Thunder,"I’m not a naval player, the highest I progress on tech trees is generally rank III-IV. How did Gaijin forget about ships and just how bad have they gotten?"
War Thunder,Naval is just meh can't even find a match lol
War Thunder,"My favourite part about war thunder is the flight system, I am not lying when I say that war thunder flying is leagues better than any other game I played."
War Thunder,Oof to bad having doesn't agree with the music
War Thunder,"Yeah, the only reason most of us still play Depression Thunder is we are waiting for that one battle with Bo Time Gaming or Phly Daily"
War Thunder,6:03 haha the guy saying SPOOKS?
War Thunder,all yo halo songs are in ma spotify plae list
War Thunder,"It’s fun but it’s challenging sorta pay to win more like play to progress I’ve been playing for 4 days I’m rank 4 in airplanes in Chinese (yes I know people hate on them but I heard they are one of the quickest to get Jets) . Once I finish this tree I’ll get my first jet it gonna be amazing love the same but it does get stressful k bought premium yesterday and it’s a help but it’s not the buff that people think it is biggest problem for me is pc players it’s like on cod how they can do things easier and do movements most ps and Xbox players can’t , in arcade it isn’t to bad but realistic it’s noticeable"
War Thunder,I only play it cause it’s free
War Thunder,Woah was not expecting to see many command and conquer Generals fans out there in war thunder i am subbing right now.
War Thunder,The UI on PS4 is extremely bad. Most things are hard to navigate and clustered.
War Thunder,"What i love about war thunder is that, like you mentioned, its a good balance of realism and arcade. Overall, the physics are more realistic, but the controls are much simpler than full sims. If you want a bit more realism, you can go to sim mode and bind all sorts of controls. If you like fast paced arcade fun, theres a mode for that too."
War Thunder,The only reason people play it is because there is no realistic tank game
War Thunder,Idk your music choice makes it feel more low quality
War Thunder,Brothers in arms is one the best video game songs
War Thunder,Only video game I play love it.
War Thunder,"The reticle for planes is too low contrast and I can’t bloody see it

The tech tree is wrong"
War Thunder,"5:27 not killing IS2, but one shoting Maus"
Castle Crashers,"Ah man, Sure do love when this game from 2008 is better then half the modern releases now."
Castle Crashers,"14 years nothing changed
Like plants vs zombies"
Castle Crashers,Spells my guy you mean magic just magic
Castle Crashers,if you buy this game get a friend it makes it x100 better
Castle Crashers,2021?
Castle Crashers,The person doesn’t sound like they want to be there this is kinda hard to watch
Castle Crashers,"You've definitely improved, from this, to what ever your doing now"
Castle Crashers,"Ign guy: simple combos 
Pro players: allow us to introduce advanced juggling"
Castle Crashers,"“ extra geekiness with the levelling up system “
???"
Castle Crashers,This guy sounds like he hates the game
Castle Crashers,He took 2 seconds to review a masterpiece ohhhhhh but cod ofc 9
Castle Crashers,I like how the mechanics and the insane mode wasnt mentioned at all
Castle Crashers,"He only talks about the fact that you can play with 3 friends.
As if i had 3 friends."
Castle Crashers,Holy crap.... this was released 11 years ago...
Castle Crashers,"2019 and still love this game, anyone else still play it?"
Castle Crashers,Didn’t know Ryan from the office reviewed games
Castle Crashers,Am I the first one here after the potential Switch announcement? 👀
Castle Crashers,"It's a 10 year old review, get over how bad it is xd"
Castle Crashers,2018 anyone?
Castle Crashers,we need a castle crashers 2 now
Castle Crashers,"I don't understand the hate for this review, it explained it very well and casually... you don't have to have 8 level 99 characters and beat the game 70 times to make a good review..."
Castle Crashers,he repeats the same thing over and over again
Castle Crashers,xD tmnt is my fave too 😍😍😍
Castle Crashers,"hi! so the problem that i have with CC, i got the game free from google, i installed the game so far so good, after i play the game like 5 -10 min it keeps stoping for 1-2 seconds , so far i can resolve the problem only if i exit the game and get back in to it! pls help"
Castle Crashers,"Its like cool and stuff and yeah. I like this because its like cool and stuff. Yeah its fun i guess, so yeah thats like cool."
Castle Crashers,castle crashers my favorite console game I don't care what you say...i love it
Castle Crashers,LOL?
Castle Crashers,He's so high Jesus Christ
Castle Crashers,9
Castle Crashers,Glad this guy doesn't do IGN reviews anymore
Castle Crashers,1:00 too much water
Castle Crashers,no joke this is my favorite video gam of all time
Castle Crashers,This guy doesn't seem very excited about the Review..
Castle Crashers,Awful game.
Castle Crashers,You didnt mention the Food minigame and the Arena mode.
Castle Crashers,"Ahh, I remember this game 2 years ago.. It was the *shit*, probably the best beat em up I've ever played. But looking at it now... I don't really play it anymore, but I'd probably love to go back. I have only a few problems with the game, though They are incredibly significant imo.

1. Some of the characters play exactly the same as another one, their only differences are cosmetics and starting weapons. Gray Knight, Royal Guard, and Conehead all have the same moves. So do Cultist and Skeleton, Thief/Peasant/Civilian and a few others. The playable character roster is kind of lazily done.

2. To unlock more characters, you need to beat the game with each character you have at least once, and then beat the with the new characters and go through all of the levels _again_. Unlocking characters becomes very time consuming when you have to play the levels all over again,

Don't expect to unlock everyone overnight, it could take days and weeks. Having to replay all these levels again and again destroys the replay value for me and it gets old fast. I wish there was a way to unlock everything instantly...

3. Side Game Modes are mediocre in my opinion, and aren't anything special. Basic Arena Modes where you fight your Friends, and other where you just try to eat the most fruit.

The game is fun, but I found that having to beat the game multiple times seriously hurts the replay value."
Castle Crashers,"PFFT! AHAHAHAHAHAHA!! Sorry but, this guy just gave absolutely no shits when making this review. ""It's like TMNT mixed with like... dungeons and dragons... yeah, and it's like, omg, addictive, yeah..."""
Castle Crashers,It seems Behemoth would not make sequel for Castle Crashers. The best chances is that some other company would get permision to create official Castle Crashers 2
Castle Crashers,"This game is awesome, but you forget to mention the most important thing. The game is based on Golden Axe. There are so many obvious common elements (like guy stealing your money, or riding monsters), that it's a shame that you didn't said a word about it."
Castle Crashers,That was the most painful review I have ever watched.
Castle Crashers,"daily deal on steam today :))
"
Castle Crashers,Hey quick question. Do people still play this game on PS3?
Castle Crashers,Needs to come to the vita
Castle Crashers,Bought this for 50% off on PSN
Castle Crashers,that's exactly what happened
Castle Crashers,This game is funnier than Deadpool.
Castle Crashers,Rating??
Castle Crashers,*Double dragon neon*
Castle Crashers,@Magibatproductions actually the guy who made this was the founder of Mewgrounds.
Castle Crashers,anyone else thinks this looks like a game newgrounds would make?
Castle Crashers,use a xbox controller then
Castle Crashers,I WILL MY GOOD SIR!
Castle Crashers,Why is it a nightmare to play on PC? You know you can use controllers on PC right?
Castle Crashers,"played it on xbox and saw it on steam 75% off and just couldn't resist-although, it's a nightmare to play on the pc so i'm gonna have to go back and play it on the xbox :/"
Castle Crashers,"It's a beat-em-up game, what were you expecting?

The major draw-in's described by the video is the RPG elements and multi-player aspect. If you don't enjoy button-mashing, rpg, or multi-player, of course it will seem boring.

Doesn't mean it's overrated. You're just not in the target demographic."
Castle Crashers,Steam Sale - 75% off. An absolute steal!
Castle Crashers,Worst IGN review i've ever seen/heard
Castle Crashers,THIS IS 3euros IN STEAM!
Castle Crashers,@Gonzo: That's why you play online.
Castle Crashers,"such a boring review, awsome game though."
Castle Crashers,I just played this on pc and it's overrated as far im concerned. Combat is repetitive and boring for my taste and it get pretty boring doing the same thing with no compelling changes after a short while.
Castle Crashers,that game was my childhood! wow i should give this a try
Castle Crashers,Made by the same people
Castle Crashers,"Is on sale on steam right now :DDDDD
"
Castle Crashers,reminds me of alien hominod
Castle Crashers,the guy that reviewed this never played king of dragons or golden axe
Castle Crashers,"want too play with me on steam?
"
Castle Crashers,yes
Castle Crashers,can you talk with youre frends when youre playing the game on the ps3? (with headset)
Castle Crashers,"I have this awesome game on my pc and it is be fun ""soloing"" and I love using the blacksmith knight"
Castle Crashers,So it got Yes/10?
Castle Crashers,I love this game so much! I wish behemoth would make a second castle crashers or even a dlc with extra levels
Castle Crashers,"I haven't played the game on PC but i have played it on Xbox. 
Yes you can play with your keyboard.
It IS fun soloing it, but It wont be as fun as playing with 3 others.
The DLC's are worth the 2 dollars, so I would buy them. They add lots of replayability.
"
Castle Crashers,"yes, and i loved it"
Castle Crashers,"hi just wondering can i play this game on PC(using my keyboard)? without a controller?
will it be fun solo'ing it?
there are two DLC's should i buy them?

please response asap thank you!"
Castle Crashers,Have you played it?
Castle Crashers,"i did play it and i did not actually look at the controls, ill not make the same mistake, but when i went to the tutorial guy he said press x to do a light attack,and i didn,t know what to press and it turned out to be a"
Castle Crashers,"it actually does, go to settings, then to keyboard settings and you can change the keyboard controls to wathever makes it more comfortable to you, hope you had fun if you could play before this comment though :)"
Castle Crashers,why? ITS THE SAME GAME 
Castle Crashers,The PC port was awful...
Castle Crashers,"$5 dollars on steam, anyone thinking about getting it should get it now!"
Castle Crashers,cant find anyone online anymore on pc :(
Castle Crashers,"i tried it, it did't work, u need a wired one"
Castle Crashers,You can use a wireless 360 controller - you need the microsoft wireless adapter thingie.
Castle Crashers,"its annoying because you need a wired 360 controller to play on pc,it dosent even tell you the controls for pc"
Castle Crashers,"66% off on steam
"
Castle Crashers,yippe im gona torrent it
Castle Crashers,cool
Castle Crashers,"oh i love it did u get it on steam? i got it on ps3
"
Castle Crashers,"Steam Sale... its 67 percent off... Go my friends, GO!!!"
Castle Crashers,this or bastion please reply?!!?!
Castle Crashers,I do.
Castle Crashers,when i play castle chrasers i feel awsome
Castle Crashers,It just came out on steam so there will be loads of people playing it on pc
Castle Crashers,Me and a couple friends all got this on steam. Its good shit
Castle Crashers,wondering if anyone still plays this
Castle Crashers,"@jesterr77 That one can be rage inducing, but trials HD was much harder, at least in my opinion."
Castle Crashers,or now trials evolution
Castle Crashers,"Yes it can, but even a good old graphics card can support the max settings, if you think the quality is awful, the reason of why is obvious."
Castle Crashers,Quality is awful? Or your graphics card is awful?
Castle Crashers,You can totally tell this video was a labor of love for you and a treat for everyone who watches it. Thank you for your this 👍
Castle Crashers,"17:33
the ""conviently placed lava hole"" was their cuz he was gonna burry his friend there!!!!!!"
Castle Crashers,I feel like I'm one of the only people that still play it on the PS3
Castle Crashers,Man bow spamming so fun
Castle Crashers,in the corn boss fight you can actually make the peasants fight by letting the corn hit them
Castle Crashers,"Back when games were good.
The whole world you fight thru is mini, on a whole different world."
Castle Crashers,anyone else notice the little trees air freshener in the ufo?
Castle Crashers,20:18 has to be the most funniest part
Castle Crashers,This game was my jam when I was younger. Jeez thinking about this game makes me feel old.
Castle Crashers,at 18:52 you could have use sandvich for more dps
Castle Crashers,"glad to see that someone remembers this game, back then this was my favorite game and still is today"
Castle Crashers,you can actually aggro the peasants in the corn boss fight by making the boss hit them. just stand by them and wait for the boss to erupt and they’ll aggravate onto the boss.
Castle Crashers,Bro i still play this game. I started in 2015 and it was my favorite game ever.
Castle Crashers,i LOVE CASTLE CRASHERS!!
Castle Crashers,the first video game i ever played. Im still playing this game. I love it so much
Castle Crashers,"This was my first game ever played.i played it when i was 3 and only played the tut for whole 2 years.eventually,my father came to visit us and bought the whole game and i came back from kindergarten when i was 5.my sister was on the console and told me she has beaten the barbaric boss.as soon as my sister was done playing i immediatly hopped on and played.i didnt have the dlc dor ps3 but i played with silver knight because he looked cool haha.then,years later 2017 i got my switch and bought castle crashers 2019.it was so nostalgic and i realized i had the other knights and didnt need to buy a dlc.i was so happy.now im 14 and still playing.i still dont have the golden skull on ny knight but who cares?the games still fun"
Castle Crashers,i played this game on ps3 all of the time in fact im playing it right now doing a xp glich on ps4 times have changed
Castle Crashers,I hate the thieves the tiny money thieves and the bombs a lot.
Castle Crashers,After beating insane mode about 18 times I can say it honestly is not that hard if you can juggle. I mean industrial castle is a cake walk on insane mode once you know the techniques of juggling. Like seriously I beat that level when I was level 21 while carrying 2 level 99’s.
Castle Crashers,This peak can NOT be forgotten
Castle Crashers,"20:30, a ship full of dads."
Castle Crashers,"I wouldn’t consider castle crashes one of the main parts of my child hood, but it was definitely a pretty decent chunk,  I never actually owned the game though so I only played the demo, but even then I still had a great time playing the game."
Castle Crashers,I struggle to find local co - op games to play with my girlfriend then I remembered this gem were having so much fun.
Castle Crashers,Am I the only one but chaoz japan is just a banger? (Simple sight is another classic)
Castle Crashers,ME!
Castle Crashers,1:51 😂😂 i remember getting them stuck on the right side of the screen spamming Y
Castle Crashers,THIS WAS THE BEST GAME WHEN YOU ARE YOUNG. It was such a button mash game and addicting. I had almost all my characters maxed out. Glad others enjoyed this absolute masterpiece 🤟🏼❤️
Castle Crashers,This was my childhood my brother says I have no life cus I finished the game 100000000 times for other characters but my childhood this game was too fun
Castle Crashers,Best game over all very nostalgic
Castle Crashers,I still play it to this day
Castle Crashers,Loved playing this on Xbox 360. Just bought it on steam recently to play through nostalgia on pc
Castle Crashers,21:49 im sorry i dont understand sims language
Castle Crashers,"i feel like it's biggest downfall is how repetitive it is past the very first playthrough
it gets pretty heavily carried by it's humor as it has the mario odyssey where ""the combo"" is the only thing worth doing and is a thing you'll be doing all the time
i wish there were more options for the magic, not like each class can use each other's magic, but just a different variation of their magic"
Castle Crashers,the beginning song is often used on some popular tiktok’s
Castle Crashers,"How 2 beat insane mode

Step 1: play industrialist/fencer
Step 2: suffer
Step 3: you did it!"
Castle Crashers,I miss the old times they were fun!
Castle Crashers,"Whats funny is this game was never on the Xbox360, It came out on the PS3. (I might be wrong but i know more people like me and my friends only played on ps3)"
Castle Crashers,I still play this game because I found it out from my brother playing it
Castle Crashers,"This game was legendary. I remember whenever I go to my grandma's house, I would go on the old PS3 and hop on it. I never had the full game, but the demo was enough to fill my entertainment all day. It's so nostalgic and fun, the music is awesome, the gameplay and story is pretty awesome too, and I always chose the green poison knight. I haven't played it in 2 years, I wish I had it. 😢"
Castle Crashers,"Xbox One? Never heard of it, anyone wanna trade theirs for my Xbox 720? Also this game's community is still kicking! Discord Servers, Reddits Pages, YouTube Videos, Twitch Streams, and often Tournaments in one of the servers (ain't saying no name I don't do promos for free)"
Castle Crashers,Nice vid
Castle Crashers,Yoo i beat the game many times with 2 dudes with me
Castle Crashers,I got a 99 gold skole
Castle Crashers,"the ""I have the shusher"" part was hilarious! 28:00"
Castle Crashers,"Wow.
You are a phsycic, castle crashers xbox 360 arcade was the first game i legitimately played through.
God tier game."
Castle Crashers,"I played this game ALL the time non-stop. My dad may be into new beat 'em up games, but old beat 'em ups in the 2000s like Scott Pilgrim, Phantom Breaker, and this game are still stuck in me. I cannot tell you how much I still love playing this game after all these years, from 2010 all the way to 2023."
Castle Crashers,yea man taht's one of the best games ever made and i still play it!
Castle Crashers,i 100%? the game
Castle Crashers,"Just picked this up for switch recently and what a hidden gem, it’s still well worth your time and a fun co op experience I highly recommend.."
Castle Crashers,Im playing right now
Castle Crashers,this game was my childhood
Castle Crashers,Truly a work of art
Castle Crashers,I do
Castle Crashers,I have so much nostalgia playing this game with my brother when we were younger. Man was it awesome to find it on psn for ps4.
Castle Crashers,"ahhhh this is so nostalgiac, i played this game so much as a kid"
Castle Crashers,The nurse a baddie 😝🥵😩😏🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵🥵
Castle Crashers,BANGER
Castle Crashers,"I might replay it, I remember it to be so fun to play with friends"
Castle Crashers,i like this kind of vid style atho i wasnt even 8 years old in 2008
Castle Crashers,Another banger! Castle Crasher and Battleblock Theater were legendary games!
Castle Crashers,I just want to know what this because I hope that they will support of a browser update
Castle Crashers,bro said screw brawlhalla castle crashers where it at
Castle Crashers,I have never played or seen this do i will not watch this untill i finish the game
Castle Crashers,"2 minutes, two views"
Castle Crashers,First
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"game is a bad PC port, devs didn't want to make a PC version and that's why you need a controller to play on PC, no other game requires a controller for PC versions of their games (this game literally does not work without a controller). this tells me the devs are lazy and this should be a console only game.
the game is good, but this shouldn't exist on PC platforms (such as steam). there are games out there that are console-only, the devs obviously didn't get the memo to keep this one console-only."
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,Moral of the story always learn how to swim💀
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,Meh... Maybe if they still made Quaaludes.
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"just finished the game before coming here, beautiful game and emotional game!"
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,This game makes me depressed.
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,Thanks for spoiling the whole ending for everyone that watches this. You shouldn't do reviews.
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,Good thing I read the comments before seeing the video! Thumbs down for sure!
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"Spoiling the biggest plot point within the very first seconds, great job, truly amazing"
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,Beautiful game. The ending was genuinely touching. Some bold moves taken in this game. Kudos to the devs
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"Thanks for the spoilers, GameSpot"
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"The set piece where the two brothers are on the glider truly felt like you were in the middle of an epic “Lord of the Rings” type adventure & of course the moment that amazingly uses the two analog control style,too meld with the story in an amazingly emotional way really makes this game a hidden gem(maybe it wasn’t so hidden,I don’t have a clue how well it sold)that deserves a play through.I mean the creators invented an entirely original language,surely that is worthy of some high praise alone!"
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,I miss the days when a 9 now was an 8 then. A real scale.
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"I haven’t played the game, luckily I looked at comments before turning the volume up."
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,😂 It's hilarious how straight to spoilers this man goes. Dead dry direct to spoilers.
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"""What the fuck"" is definitely something that is need to be said after that sentence what the fuck gamespot?"
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"So gamespot used to make reviews so bad that they were really not worthy of watching. Wow, how things change over time."
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"In a strange way, saying a game/movie begins and ends with death works for a number of stories, e.g.:
- Harry Potter - Lily Potter/Voldemort, Voldemort (again)
- Metal Gear Solid - the actual DARPA Chief, Liquid Snake (well..)
- Avengers: Endgame - ""half the universe"" (they come back), ""Thanos & Co."" (they don't)
- Gladiator (Russel Crowe) - Germanic Tribes/Roman Army (""unleash hell""), Commodus/Maximus (""honor him"") 
- Saving Private Ryan - American Soldiers and Axis Troops, Captain Miller (""earn this"")"
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"This review didn't spoil the game for me. I loved the game. I really came to appreciate it on a whole new level after beating it and then watching the commentary. There is a lot of thought that went into this one. If you want a slower paced / puzzle game with an emotional story, give this a purchase! My only gripe is I didn't get a single trophy. I thought I'd get one for beating it - oh well..."
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,Looking forward to enjoying this one. Love this sort of game.
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,what kind of review is this... that was shocking
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"So glad I wasn’t paying attention to the first part of this video, thanks comment section!"
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,visual represantation of bros before hoes
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,he spoiled the ending? ok im gonna report this video
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,This video deserves more dislikes than Likes
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"Wow, not even a spoiler warning to this day..."
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,lol f*ck off
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"Not playing this one now, thanks."
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,Just finished the game in 2020. Glad I didn't watch this review first. Major spoiler in the first sentence.
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,Stupid review!!
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"Well said Mr. Narrator I got this 'free' on game pass on X-Box and at only 3Gb download I wasn't expecting much but I was and am delighted by the sheer simplicity and at the same time the inventiveness, depth and the beauty of it. I'm loving it and don't want it to end. If I'm going on I apologise but it's worthy of high praise. 9*/10"
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,awful
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"The first sentience out of your mouth is spoilers.. WTF!
I was going to buy the game but fuck you!"
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,What the heck?!
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,Fuck you
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,You fuckers spoiled the game without any alert!!!!
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"I played this when it came out... when I was seven. I loved the game then, and I love it to this day.  
""This is so sad. But it's beautiful. I guess sadness is beautiful."""
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,Do not watch before completing the game!
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,Nice story
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,Was going to buy it before I heard the reviewer give the ending away. Nice job!
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"Was about to buy this game it's been on my wishlist for Soo long so I came to see a decent review. Heard ""starts n ends with dying & kids mama dies"" then I went to read comments & it were truly spoilers :3 thanks Gamespot. Imma keep it on list more longer now until I forget this."
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,Fuck you reviewer you fucking moron go fuck yourself
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,IGN seems to make superior reviews just by the fact that they don’t spoil the games.
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"0:23
Thanks for spoiling the ending."
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,what a stupid fuck who reviewed this
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,Worst game review i have ever seen thanks for spoilers !!!
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,god dam it i did not read the comments 1st
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"Here in 2019 and didn't look at the comments first...  Thanks, Gamespot. Take this video down."
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,26 seconds in and the game is spoiled. That must be some kind of record.
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"Nice job spoiling the fucking game in the first sentence! Fucking idiots...
I decided to save the last 2 chapters for today and I was enjoying it so much I decided to watch your review...

Y'all are trash. Unsubbing"
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,SPOILERS!!!
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,game Looks dumb
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,Wow downloading it right now thanks for the spoilers
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,Remove this terrible review! It has ruined the game for too many players for far too long!
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,I m in 2017 only one who see this 😭
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,This is why I've stopped watching reviews before I finish the game.
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,I played this with my sister.
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"Like everyone else here,, HOW CAN YOU ALLOW THIS REVIEWER TO SPOIL THE GAME ENDING IN THE FIRST SENTENCE?. I will never go to anything GameSpot again."
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,was going to buy this... thanks... :/
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"Well, no reason to buy a 3 hour long game where the ending's spoiled. I feel bad for the game developers, honestly"
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"I wanted to buy it so b4 I watched this interview now the ending and intro is spoiled , this is awful you could of told about the puzzle  etc and not the intro"
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"I was looking forward to trying it, but not after that trailer - thanks a lot, TardSpot!!!"
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,SPOILER TRAILER!! DON'T WATCH IT!!!!!!
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"""Even 'though Rosebud turns out to be a sled, you'll keep coming back to 'Citizen Kane' time and time again; 5 stars!"""
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"Just finished it. This game was way better than expected. Didn't expect to cry near the end but my icy heart was melted.
Never played anything like it."
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"One of the best games I've played in 30 years of gaming.
I played Brothers while I had a toothache. None of my painkillers helped with the pain, but this game did!

Only con is that it's very short."
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"Nice game, tho it was little bit too short, could have been so much more of an adventure,  nice experience!"
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,its really emotional game ever which let u cry and in depth of game
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,Fuck you gamespot for spoiling the game. Iam unsubscribing you and fuck you once again..
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,9.5 out of 10. An absolute masterpiece.
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,how could he spoil it in the first sentence
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,Good but very overrated game.
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,great! I was planning on getting this but you fuckers somehow managed to spoil the game in the first goddamn sentence. This video should be removed.
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"Thanks for the review. I'm not sure why so many commenters think you spoiled the ending? Nothing I didn't expect, and it looks great."
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,Did you just fucking spoil the game in a review? Fuck you gamespot
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,playing this game pissed me off so much. I hate controlling both of them at the same time
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,spoiled my interest !!!! it should be a review !  go and learn !!!
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"Just finished life is strange and was looking for some alternative. Already in marked and before payed for a game I told to myself to look on a review. Such a misstake... ok, i know now how it ends, so not buying now... thanks..."
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,Ok.. I finished the game and I read the comments about spoiling the ending... I watch the video aaaaaaand I don't see it. It shows the mother's death which is in the very beggining of the game. Where's that ending spoiler?
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,One of the best games ever: brilliant story and gameplay.
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,Thank god I read the comments before the review started cause everybody is saying it spoils the ending.
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,I can't believe the first thing he says are major spoilers of this game.
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"Interesting concept game but I like tight controls easy responsive controls, I might pass unless when it becomes cheap"
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,Thanks for spoiling the game.
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"I really liked this game a lot and I think it was very cool that you had to control both of the brothers at the same time (even though it wasn't that hard) and make them participate in order to solve the puzzles. Actually I liked almost everything about the game expect the length of it and the difficulty of the puzzles. The puzzles were WAY too easy.

So if they make another game like that, that lasts for maybe 6-8 hours, with some challenging puzzles then I would most definitely buy the next one too."
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"I can't wait for the disc release for PS4/XBO next month. Comes with concept art, director's commentary, soundtrack, etc. And secondly, when it comes to the reaction to this review, stop getting butthurt over spoilers. A good story is a good story and it doesn't matter if you know the ending or not."
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"Is it just me, or when they are in the part underground it looks so similar to Dwemer ruins in Skyrim?"
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"Ok, so I just finished the game and let me say, WOW... AMAZING game. Imo, one of the best I've played for Xbox 360. Not so much for the game play as the amazing graphics, breath taking scenary and landscapes, amazing soundtrack, along with such a great movie like story line that made me forget at times I was playing a game and not watching a movie. It really does get better as the game progresses. It reminded me so much of a Tolkien novel/movie, particularly The Hobbit. The gameplay was innovative and refreshing which made it that much better. This game had me in tears by the end and was def. worth the very low price it is sold for on Xbox marketplace. I can't put into words how this game made me feel without revealing any spoilers, so I'll leave that a mystery. Anyway, I give it a solid 9 when taking everything into consideration. It will def. leave an imprint most other 360 games fail to do. Hope you guys will enjoy it as much as I did!"
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,Stupid reviewer... First sentence spoiled the ending.
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,Not only did he spoil the ending but the background video selected showed practically the entire game.
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"How the fuck is this video still up? You're STILL ruining this game for people, two years after it's release! Awful review."
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,take down this video it spoiled the damn ending
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,Why so many downvotes?
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,I'm halfway through but wanted to see a good review of this but only to have the ending spoiled in the first damn sentence THANKS A LOT!!!!!😑😑😑😑😑
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,Toonami should review this
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"It looks pretty good. I really want play this game, but Steam says this game requires a controller. Can I play this game on my PC?"
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,I was gonna buy this but now I can't cause this review spoiled the whole story :(
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"Lol when the game finished I was like, did I complete it or get game over? "
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,fuk you gs for spoiler 
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"This is a good game. I enjoyed the music, the visuals and the intimate story. But this FUCKING REVIEWER SPOILED THE ENDING FOR ME...FUCK YOU GAMESPOT FOR ALLOWING THIS PIECE OF SHIT MARK WALTON TO PUBLISH THIS VIDEO AND KEEP HIS JOB!!"
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,Brilliant fucking game.One of the best games ive played in 20 years of gaming.And ive played them all.

Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,cock game
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,Definitely an interesting game. I got through it and enjoyed what I saw. Wouldn’t do a replay though.
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,It says it has multiplayer on switch
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,I remember Total Biscuit saying it was 1 of his best games he played. Great video as usual.
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"Nice review. Your voice sounds like Andy from Headspace, which is a compliment."
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"SOLO? Played this on keyboard(A controller for a PC!) with my daughter, as Big bro of course!! 

..oh, well... was years ago. 2020 = New + & - ..I suppose."
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,nice review! I really liked the game

Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,I played this some time ago and I really enjoyed it. It was a relaxing play that I was able to finish in one sitting. Definitely worth picking up especially if you catch it on sale.
Besiege,thank you for this review :)
Besiege,"Holy crap, man, get the microphone out of your epiglottis. Drink some water before speaking. You sound like you've got a sandwich stuck to the roof of your mouth."
Besiege,song gives me payback 2 vibes

Besiege,You need a pop filter over your microphone. My ear drums are screaming every time you pronounce a PBTK consonant.
Besiege,great video :) game seems just like my vibe just downloaded it and your commentary seems pretty solid :) keep it on
Besiege,beseige once you start unlocking your skills you begin making crazy ideas
Besiege,"My only disappointment is that new block that can be ""anything""
I miss old blocky canopys for jets, those ""realistic"" and transparent ones don't feel right"
Besiege,can you actually talk
Besiege,"This Video made me think about buy it, but im not having a very good graphic card for my pc so im not sure"
Besiege,"So I've seen other youtubers with modern jets, helicopters, and airliners. Is this a DLC or is it in the game? If its not a DLC, will I have to go through all the levels to unlock it?"
Besiege,very nice review. very helpfull
Besiege,Jesus christ why is your mouth so wet.
Besiege,"For my opinion, Besiege is a Swiss Army Knife video game if you know what I mean."
Besiege,great video
Besiege,Does it have steam workshop
Besiege,"Great editing Man, you should have 100k+"
Besiege,I have loved this game for many years
Besiege,Very good video💯
Besiege,Thanks!
Besiege,You should have at least 5k subs!
Besiege,"I want to FI ST AO C deeply, consensually, passionately!"
Besiege,"This was a great representation of the game. Honest, concise, and clear. Well done! It's nice to see some coverage of Besiege nowadays"
Besiege,Nice
Besiege,"Note the game was available in a very barebones version in 2015 in early access, it released in 2020.

Cool review though! Just saw on reddit and figured I'd just leave that minor correction, the timelines for games can be a little weird at times."
Besiege,"great vid, your channel is extremely underrated! I'm sure it'll blow up eventually :)"
Jazzpunk,"*sees character that resembles Hunter S Thompson*
""SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!!"""
Jazzpunk,"This review was so short, i though i was watching LGR blerbs for a moment."
Jazzpunk,"Great, it's just on sale on GOG just when youtube recommended me this video!"
Jazzpunk,"*looks at thumbnail*
Ah, another crappy DOS game
LGR: ""Hoho good sir, hold thine tongue!"""
Jazzpunk,"The aesthethics man, the aesthetics!"
Jazzpunk,I loved this game. I played it in one sitting.
Jazzpunk,This game has created a new genre. “Jazz punk”. A 50s post modern aesthetic but with future stuff and absurd humor.
Jazzpunk,The game is currently on sale on humble bundle.
Jazzpunk,"Pretty awesome, yet ""one use"" game. With Director Cut update its got significantly more stuff (completely revamped second level with ton of new jokes) but its still one time. Wish they do sequel."
Jazzpunk,Im extremely over the over abuse of pop culture references. We get it ffs...
Jazzpunk,Free TIbet!~
Jazzpunk,I loved that game soooooooo much ^^ best game in a long time ...
Jazzpunk,The commodore pet appearance is worth my $15 alone.
Jazzpunk,"So, it's not a game about John Zorn, then?"
Jazzpunk,"I really wanted to like this game, but what I played just didn't click with me."
Jazzpunk,"This game gives me motion sickness. It does not happen to any other game. I can read in the bus, I can fly drunk, but this game makes me feel sick in less than 15 minutes."
Jazzpunk,the James Bond reference in the hotel level had me dying XD
Jazzpunk,Where is the part with the pizza people shown in the video?
Jazzpunk,Played it in the humble bundle. Easily one of my favorite games as of late.
Jazzpunk,"Looks like I'll be paying more than the average on Humble this week. 3 Good games so far, Amnesia, Risk of Rain, and this looks pretty fun too."
Jazzpunk,"Hehe, ""Polyblanka"" VS ""Some Honda"" XD"
Jazzpunk,It's also Canadian. (Canadian here.)
Jazzpunk,Love this game!
Jazzpunk,Plz do a draw my life 
Jazzpunk,Amazing~~~ I love this game :3
Jazzpunk,"Sweet so someone did it , i was thinking of making a game fully base of pop culture are the item and quest and people yet making it all come in one , but i was thinking more point and click , But this is sweet to see there is something along the idea"
Jazzpunk,Lol. Miso sphincter.
Jazzpunk,GOTY
Jazzpunk,This is definitely a game to play if you're stressed out or in a bad mood. It's made me laugh so hard so many times.
Jazzpunk,I love this game so much it's fucking halarious
Jazzpunk,phone freaking!
Jazzpunk,"What's the word?
Thunderbird."
Jazzpunk,"Seriously, Adult Swim makes amazing games.

Check out their flash game section once in a while. It's amazing what they come up with."
Jazzpunk,This game looks awesome
Jazzpunk,This was a great game. Hilarious jokes and gags.
Jazzpunk,So.. I just found an old PC from ca 2004 anybody know any good games?
Jazzpunk,Lazy Game Reviews You should do a review or gameplay or octodad if you haven't already! (:
Jazzpunk,"More more more
"
Jazzpunk,"I'd wanna say this would be fun tripping, but I can't play games on acid"
Jazzpunk,"that games just looks bonkers, which I find appealing"
Jazzpunk,Have you ever heard of rcr (retro city rampage) and if you have what are your thoughts on it?
Jazzpunk,monty pythonish
Jazzpunk,@ 2:20 R.I.P. Joybubbles
Jazzpunk,Thanks for the review! You've got me really interested in the game.
Jazzpunk,":D - seems like a heck of a lot of work has been put into this game, I'll bet they had a lot of fun creating it!"
Jazzpunk,"""Or at least exhale sharply and chuckle to yourself"" That's exactly what I did when you said that and I soon started to wonder what life was"
Jazzpunk,"I watched Pewdiepie play this, and I thought it was hysterical. Great review, LGR!"
Jazzpunk,thanks!  Looks right up my alley!
Jazzpunk,"""Exhale sharply and chuckle to yourself"", and so I did. I'm going to love this game. Exhaling sharply and chuckling  to myself is why I do."
Jazzpunk,"This looks crazy and interesting. It reminds me of Bendo's style of games, ""30 Flights of Loving"" and ""Gravity Bone"" but way more zany!"
Jazzpunk,I played the demo and just blew up pigeons! :)
Jazzpunk,Love the look of it.
Jazzpunk,"Worth the 15 :)

Seriously its good"
Jazzpunk,"Great game. I'm actually uploading a video series for it, coincidence I think not...(gets pulled out of window to his left)."
Jazzpunk,"Looks incredible.  Next time it's on sale, I'm down to clown."
Jazzpunk,"After feeling burned on Stanley Parable, I'm holding off on Jazzpunk until there's a sale. I won't say I didn't enjoy TSP but past the initial laughs when you find something new, then.....that's it. Once there's nothing else new to find, you're done. I'm thinking Jazzpunk is in the same vein so if GOG ever has it up for $5, then I'll snatch it. "
Jazzpunk,"Adult Swim = awesome.
Cant wait to try this one out."
Jazzpunk,This game reminds me so much of blendo games like gravity bone.
Jazzpunk,Wasn't the McGuffin a Sam & Max thing?
Jazzpunk,Buying a mechanical keyboard today :D
Jazzpunk,great review. thanks LGR your voice soothes my aching scrots on these hot melbourne nights
Jazzpunk,"Are you an Adult Swim fan? I don't mean the rubbish syndicated under the Adult Swim banner these days, I mean Space Ghost Coast to Coast, The Brak Show, Aqua Teen, Sealab 2021, etc? Does the game channel that awkward, absurd kind of humour that made those old shows kinda unique?"
Jazzpunk,ha nice Hunter S Thompson reference
Jazzpunk,"I'll for sure get this if I see it on a STEAM sale, but I don't think $15 is a fair price for such a short game. "
Jazzpunk,This thing looks really promising. Thanks for the video.
Jazzpunk,"i just get sick of the style :( just like that weird game where people have box heads with drawings on this feels wrong and the simple nature makes me stomach sick mostly cause i can't stand the big city environment even though i was born in the city, just not in a New York type of city or those glass buildings that try to show of the future of america.... just destroy it all it's pathetic. "
Jazzpunk,Tried this game last night and loved the three shells in the bathroom reference.
Jazzpunk,Looks pretty awesome!
Jazzpunk,"Absolutely brilliant game, although it still keeps crashing me when I do some Compact Disc scratching after a fatal pillow fight."
Jazzpunk,"I feel tempted to buy. But I am afraid it won't have to much replay-ability once I beat the game.
...Does it have multiple ways of completing your objectives? Or is linear? "
Jazzpunk,"Will you be reviewing in the future the boxed copy of the game? It's unique and totally worth checking out. I mean, it's a freaking cereal box with actual cereal inside!"
Jazzpunk,Haven't heard of this game before but it does look highly different than usual. Love that more of these games are being made recently!
Jazzpunk,"I've been meaning to recommend this to you as it's simply just excellent, in my opinion. Seriously, let's have more weird games like this. Great review!"
Jazzpunk,Jazz o_O?? yeah Jazz xD !!!
Jazzpunk,"At 2:31 that´s Johnny Depp from ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"""
Jazzpunk,"Looks great, Clint!  Love the Captain Crunch whistle bit in the game... I'll have to pick this up!"
Jazzpunk,I saw this one advertised on GOG.com and it certainly caught my attention. Thanks for the review!
Jazzpunk,Reminds me a lot of Gravity Bone-Thirty Flights of Loving
Jazzpunk,hello from the future
Jazzpunk,a very unique game. great vid dunk.
Jazzpunk,Did this video used to be longer?
Jazzpunk,Careful for the flashing lights lads!
Jazzpunk,"i still quote ""i've been sucked into the pizza realm"" to this day"
Jazzpunk,"3:06 the ice alarm always gets me, and I love how it gets dunkey too"
Jazzpunk,"1:00 fun easter egg, they hid the prequel to pizza tower here!"
Jazzpunk,project nomads
Jazzpunk,"Hey Dunk my man can you please do a video on The©Deed franchise available on STEAM, including The Deed, The Deed: Dynasty, and of course can't forget about The Deed II.  Love Ya!~"
Jazzpunk,I get into such a bad mindset when I watch shows like they
Jazzpunk,1:37 Oscar be like
Jazzpunk,Dunky Jazz
Jazzpunk,this reminds me of La Mulana
Jazzpunk,"I've been forcing my cat to watch dunkey videos all year and already he says ""Knack 2 Baby"" when I feed him"
Jazzpunk,P
Jazzpunk,"At 3:20 what is that sound from somebody help me out I feel like I’ve heard it somewhere in a disney short

Edit: nvm I found it’s from 1:20:30 of the incredibles"
Jazzpunk,DUNKEY why the FUCK didn't you call this VIDEO JAZZDUNK
Jazzpunk,"This game makes you FEEL like.. Well, you know what, I don't know how this game makes you feel."
Jazzpunk,0:39 I just noticed there are other people in the background getting hit by cars and falling down stairs
Jazzpunk,it's a shwing ding
Jazzpunk,this game is just what dunkey always sees
Jazzpunk,Dunkey Have you tried Paradise Killer yet?
Jazzpunk,More Junkey
Jazzpunk,"I've been with Dunkey since Kanye Quest™, and I believe this is one of his best vids, if not *the* best. I always end up wishing he spent more time with the game, it's like Jazzpunk was made for him."
Jazzpunk,I tried playing this game and it made me so sick.  Not just anyone can wear dunkey's shoes like that
Jazzpunk,The lady after dealing with her fly problem say “I am in debt. I am in overwhelming debt.” Took me until writing this to realize
Jazzpunk,sussy
Jazzpunk,"0:00 “hey guys it’s me, Dunkey, I’m here with my new game: Daft Punk”"
Jazzpunk,3:11 among--
Jazzpunk,They talk like squi game
Jazzpunk,"This is the funniest Dunkey video ever, I can safely say that now after having watched all of his videos a thousand fucking times."
Jazzpunk,I still watch this masterpiece every once in a while
Jazzpunk,Mildly disturbing.
Jazzpunk,I bought this game because of dunky. And I FUCKING LOVE IT!
Jazzpunk,It’s like this game was made for dunkey
Jazzpunk,"""all work and no play makes jack a dull pizza"", genius reference"
Jazzpunk,"""they say i look like chuck e. cheese"""
Jazzpunk,It feels like dunkey made all the jokes first then made the game specifically for it
Jazzpunk,This game and video are so underrated
Jazzpunk,Pizza
Jazzpunk,My first Dunkey video
Jazzpunk,6:12 this game aged well
Jazzpunk,This game is just a massive drug trip I've just realised
Jazzpunk,"Thank you for making me buy this mastapiece of a game, dunkey."
Jazzpunk,Brewster's Pigeon Milk brought me here
Jazzpunk,The secret is that this is the universe donkey truly originates from
Jazzpunk,4:47  This guy is me
Jazzpunk,This game marches Dunkeys energy so perfectly
Jazzpunk,Missed the perfect opportunity to name the vid Jazzdunk. 0/10
Jazzpunk,egglike
Jazzpunk,"Watched this years ago and I didn't remember much, but halfway through it made me buy the game to play for the first time."
Jazzpunk,"""I'll just emulate it"" POG"
Jazzpunk,back when yt views were based on who could yell the most
Jazzpunk,"looked up ""dunkey weird game"""
Jazzpunk,"6:08 ""the democratic republic of Dr. Moreau"" jeez that got way out of hand."
Jazzpunk,Xbox on
Jazzpunk,Amazing
Jazzpunk,"Its a mashup of jazz and punk.
I call it Junk."
Jazzpunk,When games were good and funny
Jazzpunk,can't wait for the next big tf2 update
Jazzpunk,"6:11 Philippines is ""The Quarantines"" how fitting lol longest quarantine in the world baby"
Jazzpunk,I feel like it's missed potential to call it jazzdunk but then again I'm a piss baby so I don't know
Jazzpunk,Cool video
Jazzpunk,This may be the best YouToob video
Jazzpunk,The best octodad video
Jazzpunk,If only the videos were longer
Jazzpunk,dunke is so good at virtual boy tenis
Jazzpunk,This is everything Cyberpunk 2077 could have been
Jazzpunk,Dunkey somehow played a game he made in a parallel universe
Jazzpunk,This feels like a fever dream
Jazzpunk,Please wait while they bake.
Jazzpunk,"This is one of dunks best videos, this game seems so fun"
Jazzpunk,This is what cyberpunk should’ve been
Jazzpunk,"Wait, how did the mailbox know he was talking shit in real life?"
Jazzpunk,"“Theyre all flys!”
*_rrrnnnGGg_*"
Jazzpunk,This is a game made for true gamers.
Jazzpunk,all cheese and no toppings makes dunk a dull pizza
Jazzpunk,is this what a fever dream is like?
Jazzpunk,"This game will overshadow everything in whichever video it will ever be featured in. No one can add anything to it, make fun of or criticize it. One can only highlight stuff. And that goes for dunkey as well. Compared to his other stuff, this is a very weak episode. There is nothing to this game other than its highlights and if you have played it, this video here will give you nothing. It makes you only aware of the game and parts of it will have been spoiled because they are identical to every player."
Jazzpunk,"6:12 The Philippines as The Quarantines, so fucking accurate today"
Jazzpunk,"Dunkey has more views then pewdiepie

Nice"
Jazzpunk,This is my favorite dunkey video
Jazzpunk,Jazzpunk is a game that everybody can enjoy... But Millennial Electrical Engineers enjoy it WAAAY more than you ever could.
Jazzpunk,This video made me buy this game. I have absolutely no regrets. If you're reading this then buy the game.
Jazzpunk,"Captain Eggcellent, where you at, mate?"
Jazzpunk,Did... did I just od on LSD?
Jazzpunk,I actually had no clue you could just go over and smack the editor with a chair to end the tennis game sooner
Jazzpunk,This feels like what a good adventure dream feels like
Jazzpunk,This game is cyberpunk but better
Jazzpunk,I like how Dunkey doesn't even have all that much to add. Jazzpunk says everything for him. Every reaction Dunkey has is unusually appropriate just because of this particular game.
Jazzpunk,It bothers me that the title isn't Jazzdunk
Jazzpunk,Jazzpunk is a lost media that needs to be revisited
Jazzpunk,We gonna ignore the fact this game was made  for dunkaroo
Jazzpunk,"i love daft punk, it's my favorite game."
Jazzpunk,I like how Dunk literally just rolls with everything that happens
Jazzpunk,I cant believe we'll never get a daft punk two now that they broke up..
Jazzpunk,The original Cyberpunk
Jazzpunk,This game deserves second look by dunkey and possibly a Dunkview in my opinion
Jazzpunk,"yes youtube, this is octodad"
Jazzpunk,Hold up the description says octodad
Darkwood,"Darkwood on GOG - http://gog.la/NotAsScaryAsFinnishWoods
THE LIST - https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_K3ziSxT9zcUUGCddS4sF1uNJTWHSbOwB1CQX2Rx4Uo
I'd strongly recommend giving Darkwood a try. It was hard not to show off too much of the game!"
Darkwood,1987 in Poland is like early 60s in the West :P
Darkwood,Bio-arborial
Darkwood,lovecraftian- when u where talking about what style the game is. idk
Darkwood,"Eastern European here, specifically Roma, can confirm that we are a lonely, depressing bunch amd this game is basically a true to life experience of our daily lives lmao"
Darkwood,As an eastern europeanian i can confirm how our typical day looks like
Darkwood,"missed one thing. at night u might get knock on the door, little delay and another knock on the door. might think it trader but it is night time. soo......"
Darkwood,The worst part of Darkwood is knowing there's nothing else quite like it!  It's one of my favorite games.
Darkwood,10:22
Darkwood,"I think the reverse stamina thing of “slow attack uses less stamina” is actually genius. It’s more exhausting to swing shit fast than it is to swing it slow and try to preempt it. Splitting logs doesn’t just use inertia after all, it needs FORCE."
Darkwood,"This game looks interesting, but I hate vision cone stuff immensly.
It's just incredibly tedious and annoying."
Darkwood,The nights in this game are the most horrifying and stressful 270 seconds ever.
Darkwood,great video
Darkwood,"If you hate excessive inventory management, just get the mod that lets you stack items higher."
Darkwood,So this is what its like to experience a wiccan curse!
Darkwood,I luv this game
Darkwood,"I’m starting to think Yomowari might be a good horror game to try. Deliberately paced, audio heavy, and it doesn’t rely on jumpscares."
Darkwood,I just started learning guitar and I immediately caught on to the STALKER tracks you use. Good job MG
Darkwood,The sound of a snapping twig outside at night has never made me feel like this. First playthrough and those first few nights are genuinely terrifying. Terrific horror game with terrific sound and terrific music.
Darkwood,"The tree trunks actually aren't 3d, that's just an illusion brought on by the dark area that represents your characters obscured vision, which if intentional was really clever"
Darkwood,15:05 / 15:20
Darkwood,Gods or Chaos Engine on GoG ...
Darkwood,"The thing about the lore of this game is it was to my understanding that it was left up to the players imagination with some subtle hints here and there, the biggest theory that I had about 'the being' was that it could communicate through radio waves, always speaking to the protagonist through the radio in one way or another, and when you get to the radio station you see the guy in the bed, whether he was alive or dead was unknown to us, but he had root like veins pulsating from his body that led out into the forest as if it was that man's mind connected to this entire plague that was affecting everyone in it. That was my own personal theory about the game, and I think when you leave these idea up to the player it can be truly terrifying. The idea that all of it was a dream of someone else and you were just living in it unknowingly and unwillingly. True horror. Love these games when no one is truly right or wrong about the games story. This game deserves all of it's praise."
Darkwood,"Yeah, so... I lately played this game for 20h and never even finished the 1st chapter. The atmosphere and horror is so good, but survival gets pretty tedious later on and the difficulty spike in the Old Woods was when I had to say to myself: yup, that’s enough for me. I just know that I don’t have not nearly enough self-determination to push all they way trough the finish line. I started playing “Persona 5” instead and I don’t regret it. Oh, and I also didn’t see a great number of weird things while playing it, especially during nights. For me they were always more of the same. I saw maybe 5% of what is shown in this video and it got me thinking: did I do something wrong while playing this game? Oh, well, no matter. I can always watch it on YouTube later."
Darkwood,a bug's life playstation game music bro x) you are a true scholar
Darkwood,"I didn't have any weapons on my first night because I didn't see the work table. A savage climbed in the window, but I ran into the next room. It followed me, but I managed to run back to the original room. When it tried to get back in I closed the door, but it tried to open the door, and ultimately I had to spam RB constantly to keep it closed. After two solid minutes of button mashing I somehow made it to the morning."
Darkwood,"I call the art style ""East European realism"". Another example is HighFleet."
Darkwood,Game is trash 🗑️ no direction at all just wonder aimlessly trying to figure out ur objective
Darkwood,"It wouldve been an amazing game, if there was no Chapter 2. *Sigh*"
Darkwood,This game tells u nothing of what to do...kinda sux
Darkwood,schyzo core game
Darkwood,FoR tHe AlGoRiThM
Darkwood,"A short film I just found by accident related to this game. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=reHU2so1rac"
Darkwood,Ita free on epic rn grab it
Darkwood,"How about 'Kinda like Giger but instead of Biomechanical it's Mechanobiological'.

I feel like version imrpoved on yours by like 3% 😊"
Darkwood,"I loved everything except the combat. I get that they were trying for 'hard' on purpose, but there are several enemies that just spawn inside your house no matter what you do to fortify it. The reputation system is also determined by whether you survive the night or not, so it can get to be a cycle where you keep dying and then can't buy anything because you don't have enough reputation, and then cus you cant buy anything, you keep dying. Lol. 

The items/loot also don't respawn in an area from what I can tell. So once you loot an area, that's it. You're not gonna get more logs or mushrooms or whatever you may need. Forcing you to move to the next area with the harder to defend hideout...only for you to die and enter the reputation loss cycle. 

If this was somehow salvageable by smarter gameplay (fortifying your house properly, best usage of daylight, etc) I'd be fine. But you are forced to fight at night, forced by necessity to leave area 1 (the easiest to defend) early, all while contending with shitty item durability, and traps and blockades that literally do nothing to stop enemies from entering your stronghold. Literally, they last like 2 hits from an enemy. So all that time you spend collecting wood to board up windows? To set up traps? Yea it's not gonna be worth much. 

Anyways, don't know why I wrote an essay here lol. I was super disappointed I guess cuz I loved the world of the game, the atmosphere, and I really wanted to experience more of the story. But there's 'hard' and then there's just 'wasting my time'."
Darkwood,"I honestly fucking hate the idea that most of the story was ""just a dream"", it takes away massively from the impact of playing the game and story in general, so the way I interpret it is this:
The protagonist swaps clothes with a scarecrow because he is a soldier who was sent in by the government to investigate the forest, but the creatures made by the forest attacked and killed everyone except for him, however he is horribly scarred by the attack. the events of the game play out, and it is revealed that the tree monster is making monsters by spreading a plague, and forcing people to dream to feed itself, which it was about to do to you, but you kill it and end it's reign."
Darkwood,"This game is being given away for free on Epic Store right now, until 20 October. After that they'll give away Fallout 3 and Evoland."
Darkwood,thanks for reviewing. This game is free on Epic games but I don't think it's for me lol.
Darkwood,its free on epic
Darkwood,"How about ""bio-arborial""?"
Darkwood,"Dark Fairytales are a thing, “Die Schwarze Prinzessin” or “The Dark Princess”, it has a happy ending but the story itself festures a demonic princess horribly murdering people in an abandoned Cathedral."
Darkwood,"It’s one of the few games that actually does terror properly.
All without scripted cutscenes or events.
It’s a brilliant game and I hope the devs are able to carry on their work."
Darkwood,Free on epic right now as of 10/13/2022
Darkwood,Free on epic yall
Darkwood,"""So they defended themselves with magic. Magic kalashnikovs."" That is my new favorite line right there."
Darkwood,Darkwood is amazing wish the developer would do more with it.
Darkwood,"Why do games always give humans a 90°field of vision instead of what it actually is, 200-220...🤦🏼‍♂️
Looks good though"
Darkwood,"I just realized I own this game, wow. I know what I am doing this week."
Darkwood,The big evil tree dream monster sounds like a Zygomind tbh.
Darkwood,A good game! Years I was looking for a good horror survival game  this is it
Darkwood,"I found out about the wolfman chest cheat and just waited through a bunch of nights in the silent forest to horde ammo, then Doom Guyed my way through the swamp. Im a degenerate scumbag but damn it was fun."
Darkwood,The whole point of magic is too ruin it
Darkwood,if there is ANY video game that deserves a parallel but not 1:1 movie adaptation i think this one would create the most culture-king movie in a decade
Darkwood,"if I am not mistaken, the being is an eldritch creature and it came riding a star that fell from the sky I mean.. an asteroid"
Darkwood,for me..those shadows lurking events are the best events...u just need to stick to a sorce of light... = not wasting resources like bullets and shit.
Darkwood,2:50 he really put a STALKER guitar song
Darkwood,I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: the dev team behind Darkwood is also one of the nicest group of folk I’ve ever had the pleasure of knowing.
Darkwood,+ You can still download it for free coz devs put this game on torrents. Want it? Try it. Like it? Buy it. ;)
Darkwood,"I'm suprised you made a video about a documentary game, especially if the documentary talks about something as boring as an average life in a polish village"
Darkwood,poland mentioned :DDDD
Darkwood,"...Guess I'll have to not watch the spoilers so to enjoy this if and when I can get and play it. Thanks again, oh Mandalore the Gamer."
Darkwood,"If anyone is on the fence about getting Darkwood, do it! It'll test your patience and nerves. Also it must be said that playing with headphones or earbuds is pretty much mandatory if you don't want to get eaten. Also, don't turn on the radio..."
Darkwood,Looks like a topped down version of silent hill
Darkwood,Once i heard weapon durability i was oh hell nah this not my type of game 😅😂😂
Darkwood,Thanks!
Darkwood,Going biking to a store as an european
Darkwood,I hear Fallout 1 music...
Darkwood,OMG where is the ending music from. Im sure its from a game don't remember which. its killing me
Darkwood,I'm sorry but these kinda games aren't or shouldn't be considered games. Just a nifty con to generate cash flow
Darkwood,"I didn't realize this while playing but damn the sound design is freaking amazing, moving furniture around and renovating your house has never been so scary"
Darkwood,Summary of darkwood: drunk polish person tries to get to the store
Darkwood,"If you love those element, you will gonna love Darkwood:
1.RUN back to the hideout when you are really far away, and hope you can make it before the night
2.Hiding still in the dark corner because your generator running out of juice and pray the monster won't find you in the dark(Spoiler: they will)
3.Try to ignore the knocking sound of your front door. BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY RIGHT!?
4.Pretend no hearing any growl and walking sound from the door behind your back because you put two closet and a chair in that door, it gonna be safe, right?
5.Use all your weight to push the door back up when somebody trying to push in. They won't know it is you doing the pushing, so they won't come to you, right?
6.You heard the barricaded window got torn down, and you hear some footstep closing in. But if you don't move and just rise your axe ready, they won't find you here, right?
7.Some supernatural power just kill all, but this one light. So you gave up your defence and run to the light because you think it will make you safe?
8.All the furniture start moving and you are force to abandon your position, then you hear the door open up gentlely...
9.Scream in fear and rage at whoever or whatever came into your house and start chase and beat them.WHY CAN'T YOU JUST LEAVE ME ALONE!!
10.Chase down and beat some random guy to death because you don't like what he's look like. It's completely ok because he gonna backstab you, right?"
Darkwood,I think the word you are looking for is Lovecraftian horror.
Darkwood,"On 7:10 you said ""wolfman target"" while it would be much superior to say ""wolfmart"".
I give this review a 0/10."
Darkwood,I heard Russia went into the Finland forest 2 times and was never heard of again.
Darkwood,"Dark wood should do there next game in a old abandoned town or city, top down. Walk in a building and then it shifts to show you the inside. Also have some settings in there next game where the sun is so bright and blisterin8light that the shadows cast from building reveal the world. Put in a hour or so and think it is something really cool. There you have it devs. Town in a desert with some hills have eyes freaks coming at you. Top down nutter with chainsaw and tractor chasing you around the town following you in the buildings."
Darkwood,"Your review convinced me to try this out, I have now about 120 hours on it..."
Darkwood,Brilliant game
Darkwood,"Hey, I live on a normal Finnish forest, this game seems really easy."
Darkwood,"Damn I had seen videos of this game but none of them sold it to me like you did, I'm now convinced and will surely get it."
Darkwood,Unsubscribed
Darkwood,Can I play with my friend? And we be on different ps4?
Darkwood,"I really enjoy your content. I feel like i'm vicariously playing games I might otherwise have never had an interest in.
You speak in a pleasant way that doesn't make you sound like a fuckhead at any point. It's quite nice."
Darkwood,I played darkwood mobile game it was captivating but in the end was a cash grab like others
Darkwood,Wild…
Darkwood,"I think it would be, Bio-arborius. Not, ""Bio-arboribus.  Where is the ""bus"" part coming from? Arbor means trees, so ""arborius"", or ""arborious"", seems to make more sense."
Darkwood,"""Zooarboreal"" is probably a slightly better made up word for what you were getting at."
Darkwood,Darkwood captures the Lovecraft feeling I wanted better than anything else I have played. It was so good.
Darkwood,"My first run of Darkwood ended when I encountered a bug that seemed to prevent me from progressing, but also left me unable to die. It may have been patched, but I haven't played it since"
Darkwood,Bio arborious is like that the floor here is made out of floor meme
Darkwood,"Halo CE is a hidden gem in my eyes, because of all the mystery. How does the flood work? Where does it come from? Who are the forerunners? Who are the covenant? What happened to earth? None of this is answered, and it makes it awesome. But then the sequels came out, and ruined all that by giving boring, bland answers that removed that mystery, that desire for knowledge."
Darkwood,"I think this being is communism, there are some similarities xD"
Darkwood,I'm sold on the Mark Morgan Fallout music. Thank you for this <3
Darkwood,"Upvote for showing that I never want to get anywhere near this game lol
I am such a chicken"
Darkwood,"Played for the first time, roughly an hour passed and I just realized that I'm basically living in a crackhead shack where I can cook skill-drugs while having to dodge local murder pagans."
Darkwood,"I try vet hard to get into this game , but it so confusing and I can’t even tell what I’m looking at half the time"
Darkwood,"Fell asleep in the first 15 minutes. Too boring for my taste, reminds me of Monkey Island and wasting time on trying to figure out what to interact with."
Darkwood,"I've tried five times to play this game, I've failed each time."
Darkwood,Don't give the violin kid that fucking key
Darkwood,"I believe this game is coming out on the Switch sometime soon as well. Might be fun to scare on the go though I can't speak for optimization.
Sorry this took so long. January is a slog. Though I should have my next project out far more timely."
Darkwood,"I remember playing it for the first time and on the fourth day, I got haunted and it was the most genuine fear I have felt in years. You know when you're a kid and your parents leave ya home alone for the first time? That weird paranoia you feel that someone might come in or that, since it's late, you'd probably see someone walk by behind you? Never did a game do that to me, not in  Condemned, not in Silent Hill, not in Dead Space, not in any fuckin horror game did it give me the feeling that a ghost was harassing me. Remember the bedroom door in game just slammed open as the new day dawned."
Darkwood,Literally got jumpscared by the opening line.
Darkwood,least violent german fairytale
Darkwood,"People really under value horror as a tone or theme. Gamers think that horror games mean being actively scared or tense but a great horror game can simply nail the vibes of the genre. Darkwood and Bloodborne are fantastic horror games that get the aesthetic and themes right, but aren't given enough credit because they don't jumpscare you (minus the crows and bogs in BB)."
Darkwood,"There are like two different kinds of horror games. There’s the kind with a jump scare every 5 minutes and then there is Atmospheric Horror. Atmospheric horror does usually include a jump scare or two. However, this kind of horror uses the environment to scare you. A perfect example is the Bioshock series. Little to no jumpscares in those games. Yet they are still creepy. How? Well you hear a million sounds in the distance that are all much bigger in magnitude and loudness, you hear the crazed voices of enemies screaming but you can’t find them. Your in abandoned cities. It’s dark, there is no one coming to save you and there is no safe place (like there is literally no safe place to hide or a place that cannot be accessed by enemies). It’s all run down and destroyed. You know there must be thousands dead as you listen to their final moments on tape. There are freakish experiments, hulking mechanical monsters, that old creepy cartoonish 50s advertising that you see everywhere as you walk through the dilapidated and rotting halls. It’s incredible."
Darkwood,Jumpscares make Horrormovies bad imo. I love this uncanny horror that gives you goosebumbs. The Mandela Protocol (series here on Youtube) is a good excample for that. No Jumpscares just uncannyness.
Darkwood,"Dude.... We have so much in common I swear... When i played Darkwood and actually beat it, it resonated so much with me and It Follows is to this day still my favorite horror movie ever"
Darkwood,"“The cripple”
*shows iron hands*
I’m fucking dying"
Darkwood,Need more of these. I love horror but can't stand jumpscares
Darkwood,1:04 that caught me off guard
Darkwood,Dude all of those at the start are german
Darkwood,"Horror media with jumpscares can still be scary. You People arent better just becuz you dont watch horror media with ""jumpscares"""
Darkwood,"It's not isometric, it's just top down. 
Isometric is something like HoM&M 3 or Fallout 1. They typically have a slightly tilted camera and most importantly - no perspective to it."
Darkwood,"Say, did you play Scorn? Maybe you wanna check it out since you are into this stuff. 🙂"
Darkwood,"I never did finish this game, at least 3 times though i made it to the 3rd section of the map and it got so difficult i gave up, But, i got better at it every time i started again. For me it is brilliant though so unforgiving."
Darkwood,"I was SO excited to enjoy this game that I got it both on Steam and the Switch... and then the first instant they showed me (this is non-spoilery) holes inside a house early in the game, my trypophobia was triggered and I've never touched the game again since 🙃"
Darkwood,"Fully agree on everything. Bought it with zero expectations, was blown away by the atmosphere"
Darkwood,4:33 - It's not the word. It's either top-down (which it is) or isometric (which it isn't). Isometric is a specific type of projection where things measure the same along every axis (iso=same / metric=measurement). In practical terms it means the camera is 45 degrees to the side and (slightly over) 35 degrees up from horizontal. Top-down means it's 90 degrees from horizontal.
Darkwood,"0:37 - Wait, a _werewolf?_ Is this some updated Twilight-esque version of Red Riding Hood?"
Darkwood,Hänsel und Gretel are indeed german but so are all the other fairytales.
Darkwood,I just don't understand how people can get these many feelings from that style of game. Overrated trash. I can't believe I seriously played through this entire game because a friend really thought that I'd get afraid or excited. You guys have to be some of the most boring people on earth to enjoy this that much. Like how the fuck do you get that tense over pixels?
Darkwood,ya
Darkwood,5:46 weren’t the traders the ones who crucified Jesus?
Darkwood,Isometric is not the word you were looking for
Darkwood,3:19 there’s not a single horror scene I saw in my childhood that topped this scene right here. Just unsettled the fuck out of me
Darkwood,I love darkwood but I have no idea were to go
Darkwood,kentucky simulator
Darkwood,"It Follows was only so-so. It gets way too much praise for being so boring.

Smile is similar to IF but does everything way better."
Darkwood,"Wanna see if your date is worth your time? Ask them which horror movies they like. If they mention movies with jump scares, they’re as plastic as a Kardashian."
Darkwood,Dude... Dude! Project Zomboid.
Darkwood,Welp i’ve started this video and immediately need to 💩 so the horror is doing something right
Darkwood,Honestly.. the best way to describe Darkwood is fairytale.
Darkwood,1:10 what the fuck
Darkwood,Soma and Layers of Fear I think are the top two best horror games regardless
Darkwood,"Lmaooo the mirror Myers grabbing you off the Gen is not an example of you being a pussy, he gets us all my guy"
Darkwood,"I bought this after years of hesitation, because a lot of my fave youtubers loved the shit out of it and it SEEMED to be in the ballpark for me. Bruh. What a fucking unvieldy, slow, sluggish, irritating and agonising piece of shit this is. 

You are better off reading/watching a summary than suffering through whatever ""gameplay"" this shitware offers."
Darkwood,Since when was the wolf in Red Riding Wolf a werewolf?
Darkwood,"I love this game to the death.
But saying that it has no jump scares is a lie .
It has, but its not relying on them to make the atmosphere and to make you tremble literally.
It uses it scarcely and to be honest after so much time being tense , it's kinda a relief when it happens.
Ps. I just read the title. no regrets"
Darkwood,So glad someone has the same opinion on jump scares as me
Darkwood,"Jump scares are lame, and I’ve never jumped a jump scare. I roll my eyes."
Darkwood,Are you IGP?? With a voice CHANGER??  I feel like I'm losing my mind.
Darkwood,i dont know house in the woods is a damn unsettling game
Darkwood,Showing a dog dying? Really? This is as cheap as a jumpscare.
Darkwood,Rise and Shine! Productions did a fantastic fan film on this game on here.
Darkwood,"""Eat the old lady""

What a helluvan introduction"
Darkwood,Darkwood is also a great band.
Darkwood,"Sleeping Beauty, Red Riding Hood and Hänsl and Gretel are all German 📖"
Darkwood,"Bit of a correction for the base explanation: You definitely CAN go outside. You can do basically whatever whenever. You just better be bricked tf up if you're wandering at night, and keep those stamina and health pillies on deck."
Darkwood,I come back to this vid almost once or twice every year
Darkwood,I refuse to play this game because when I tried I got constant nightmares in my sleep.
Darkwood,What chapter was the cripple?
Darkwood,"I just noticed that Bricky used the past version of the German national anthem. While not necessarily wrong. We just don't sing the text sung there, since it isn't hard to associate the text with a certain unfortunate time frame of our history."
Darkwood,Cool
Darkwood,Maybe the money popping up onto the screen was the jumpscare.
Darkwood,"Honestly, i found this game pretty boring. Just walking around not knowing what to do"
Darkwood,"hey bro, can you not spoil something about a game in the title and thumbnail? Ig it doesn't matter that much, I just haven't played that game yet, and I want to and want to be scared. But yk Im less scared bc now Ik there aint no jumpscares. It's not a huge deal, just something to consider for future content."
Darkwood,"What with the new YouTube changes, this probably got demonetised too."
Darkwood,4:21 I would say bear traps is kinda jumpscares too. While playing Darkwood I sometimes step on them (especially in 3rd part of the first wood) and it really freaks me out.
Darkwood,You know it's a good game when a pixelated 2D horror game is above 1GB size.
Darkwood,I never forget about the wedding
Darkwood,Do not give the violin kid that fucking key.
Darkwood,"Darkwood stories are almost on the same level as Stalker stories and Darkwood does the atmosphere and horror thing even better than Stalker. Those first few nights on your first playthrough..omg haha. Never have soft footsteps outside in the dark unnerved me like they did in this game. Of course, the impact falls away the more playthroughs you do but there's an rng there and big threats can pop up very early on. Pretty rare but it's possible. I've had a moving banshee spawn on the second night."
Darkwood,"Spoiler Alert

You literally cannot survive outside of the hideout because a massive cloud of red gas chases you around, slowly clipping away at your health if you’re not being protected by the oven’s fumes."
Darkwood,"There was a community made map for TF2 called Crypto-Forest, and it too was a horror map without jumpscares, it rather relies on the fear of the unknown, and impending doom, as you have 5 nights to complete The Trader missions and stop a cosmic entity from invading, the atmosphere is absolutely amazing for *just* a community map, and let alone a TF2 map, and it was one of the scariest experiences me and my friends had in that game."
Darkwood,The brothers Grimm fairy tails was actually very dark but most people know the sanitised Disney versions which is a shame
Darkwood,you dont need jump scares if it`s a good psychological horror game
Darkwood,It follows is terrible
Darkwood,What about little nightmares?
Darkwood,Kind of same vibes as the Earth's Center Of Gravity.
Darkwood,the ending immediately reminds me of Love Death Robots' Beyond the Aquila Rift episode. Ignorance is bliss when you learnt the truth is nothing else but impending doom
Darkwood,All of the 3 fairy tales you named in the beginning are German. As is nearly any widely known fairy tale
Darkwood,Umm this doesn’t seem scary and you don’t seem like a good judge since you say your really scary
Darkwood,thats what they like you to think
Darkwood,1:24 POLSKA GUROM
Darkwood,This is on another level of Comic Horror.
Darkwood,Wolf man is kinda a dick.
Darkwood,As a Polish person this is a very accurate portrayal of traditional vacations we take
Darkwood,Why would you eat Mario and Luigi's grandma?
Darkwood,"Come down to the Polish wilderness.
We have lots trees.
Fast delivery service.
Cannibal wolf people.
Again lots of trees.
Convenient sellspersons.
Talking snails.
Again, trees.
Mario's Grandma
And a big, mind controlling, man eating, Super Organism. 

Oh and handsome young  musicians."
Darkwood,I absolutely love Bricky's LOVE for the Trader XD
Darkwood,"im in love with this game. im in love with it although i cant play for more than an hour. after roughly an hour it feels like my heart will burst. the amount of tension and fear you will experience from being outside exploring and realizing that the darkness is creeping up is overwhelming. i was in the dry meadows area and i just found The brook, my hideout was in the 2nd area (southeast of the 1st hideout) when sunset hit. i started sprinting home but ran into this stag that just kept chasing me, it drove me off course and by the time i got it off me it was pitch black. i was actually panicking, i told myself over and over again to remain calm and rational but my heart and mind was RACING and i wasnt even being chased at that point. no other horror game has made me panic if i wasnt being chased. the fear of knowing what could come but also the fear of NOT knowing what might come after you will make your heart race. i was rougly 100 metres from my hideout when i heard it, the darkness. the red looming mist pursued me and just barely reached me just before i got home, switched on the generator and barricaded myself in. this game is a must play."
Darkwood,This one is okay because it's German.... I'm laughing so hard!
Darkwood,Thank you
Darkwood,"Fun fact: Snow White and red riding hood are also from Germany 
(This also goes too sleeping beauty Cinderella and rapunzel)"
Darkwood,"Got this game free on Epic Games, definitely trying it out."
Darkwood,jumpscares are cool as fuck youre just a pussy
Darkwood,oh no it is just scary play it your selfe (for anyone who thinks its not scary)
Darkwood,"Instead of a generic horror game with jumpscares every 5 seconds, or a game where you are a god among men and kill everything quickly, dark wood is unique, it makes you feel like a human in horror dominated world, every single fight even the ones with the weakest creatures is satisfying to win cause here you are not the chosen one, instead, you are the base of the food chain, especially in the beginning were you don't even have a weapon to defend yourself, you can barely survive the day and at night every single second WILL BE difference between life and death something that is totally brutal on hard and hardcore were you got limited lives, is a fantastic experience even for people that don't like horror games I totally recommend, just one tip: the trader is your guardian angel for countless times I needed a specific item and he gives that to you, my tip is to sell stuff you don't want in exchange for good loot AND NEVER FORGET THE OVEN AND THE GAS FOR THE GENERATORS without those you WILL die during the night"
Darkwood,Guys is free on epic until the 20th of october
Darkwood,it's free on epic games rn
Darkwood,"For anyone wondering, the game is free right now at Epic Games launcher"
Darkwood,"People be praising this game for having no jumpscares...






But nobody is praising it for being the game that made Hotline Miami into a survival horror game."
Darkwood,Just got this game for free on the epic store my first night I'm standing there i didn't refill the generator because I thought it'd just last until morning since that's what it says when you examine it I hear some sort of walking I look outside and a dog is walking around suddenly the bedroom door clicks open and the generator shuts off so I turn my flashlight on and quickly go outside to refill the generator I nearly shit myself lol.
Darkwood,Fairy tails were originally really dark. Over time people lightened them up.
Darkwood,"Absolutely false, this is a very, very bad game with clumsy controls, bad coding, extremely stupid and intentionally unfair gameplay."
Darkwood,"If anyone's seeing this 2 years later, darkwood is free on epic games 🗿"
Darkwood,"No jump scares, no thanks."
Darkwood,"This video is so full of spoilers it’s crazy. It’s not a review, it’s “let me tell you everything about the game before you pick it up”."
Darkwood,Neat how they recreate a real life field of vision from top-down
Observation,Love the vibes
Observation,Is this the guy that’s a bit of a predator?
Observation,I've looked for this game's name for WEEKS. Excellent review on the gameplay details.
Observation,The devs are now making a Silent Hill game 🙀
Observation,couldnt even play the game and had to refund it right after buying since my 1440p screen resolution still isnt supported.
Observation,Great job👍
Observation,Puzzles in a pc game just put me off wanting to play. Puzzles bring the escapism to a grinding halt.
Observation,"This is a perfect sci-fi game and story. All the people hating on it have no patience, or observational skill. The best games never hold your hand."
Observation,This is uttter rubbish - its a mini game after mini game puizlemania. Just watch «worth a buy» review.
Observation,Just beat this game last night and I’m surprised to see ign and myself reached the same verdict solid game go play now
Observation,"Just finish the game
It's amazing"
Observation,"Just came to the conclusion, ”why they are there” impressive!"
Observation,Fun game of BEING HER lol
Observation,The intro alone convinced me.
Observation,"Great game, would love a sequel or another game like it. Hardly any game out where you play as an AI"
Observation,One of those gems.
Observation,whatculture wwe
Observation,Among Us in 3D
Observation,I just played the game. I hate how there is no clear objective in many parts of the game. I had to stop playing half way through because I was tired of aimlessly floating around the space station. I watched the rest of the game on youtube. I really loved the story and eerie feeling to the game. The visuals are awesome aswell but I just wish some things were more obvious to make it more enjoyable to play.
Observation,I finish this game and that game was really awesome and fantastic story like gave a puzzle to find out what hapoen and what going on love it.
Observation,Who's here after it was put on playstation now?
Observation,Gonna try it since it's on PSnow.
Observation,You are speaking way too fast. It would have been better if you just slowed a little.
Observation,"Essentially, a game that near-perfrectly nails what it sets out to do."
Observation,LOVE THIS GAME
Observation,I wonder if there will be a 2
Observation,"Downloadong right now. 
Y'all get alot of Hate but I refer to your vids for reviews  IGN. Been a fan since Adam Sessler and Morgan Webb. Stop The Hate Train, they do us major justice with their information."
Observation,Such a boring game unresponsive game controls extremely annoying uninstalled within 5 minutes it's literally just puzzles with no explanation of what you're supposed to be doing or how you're supposed to be doing then it's literally like a boring interactive movie where you swap from camera to camera and they just dragged out every single type of thing that you need to do it's just a draw boring game I hated this game right away what a major disappointment since I'm So Into sci-fi story
Observation,Game pass
Observation,Playing it on Xbox Game Pass now its awesome game
Observation,Looks boring
Observation,Here because Game Pass just announced its been added this month. looks interesting
Observation,"So basically this is the closest thing we’re actually getting to an Alien Isolation sequel?  Alright I’m down.


Note: I’m aware that this is a wildly different game than Alien Isolation, which is why I view it as more of a companion piece to Alien Isolation than a sequel."
Observation,"well i have the game it is interesting yes,but for me i wanted it better to be not the station,the ai but the human and have weapons and stuff and aliens like alien isolation but with another inspired alien with abilities and stuff,it would be emazing a first person like alien isolation.its nice thought but not what i expected...but it has potencials in a second game to be a first person like shooter but not 100%shooter but surviving like alien isolation.i hope developers read my comment and make another game with what i said it would be a must game to play.this is weak but ok i understand its a story game and for a sci fi story game it is good.i like the felling of isolation on space and solve a puzzle with aliens involved...if i had to vote il give it 7-8/10"
Observation,"great game! Just finished it! However the PC port isn't up to par. The controls are fairly dinky, although i believe some is intentional, in some case i believe its un intentional and makes looking for secrets and some puzzles very difficult!!! Also the facial expressions and human models as mentioned are sub par :(."
Observation,Did they use the Alien 3d engine for this one?  The gfx seem similar and I immediately thought of that game.  I have another question: should I play Alien first and then this one?  And lip-synch still not perfect is a minor d'oh.
Observation,"uh oh, same people who made alien isolation? i tried to play that game recently and it was still a buggy mess to a game breaking point, literally, i had entire levels worth of npc enemies spawning in a single room and not moving, like all in a line just broken."
Observation,"2001: space oddissey ""the video game""? Say no more! I just bought it!"
Observation,"Nah, got bored just watching this review let alone play it"
Observation,About how long is this game?
Observation,What I cant figure out Is why can't they make the games or at least the cinematic parts like that love death robots episode helping hand?
Observation,"What? An IGN review by someone who actually play the game more than 1 hour?
Fantastic."
Observation,Love Alien Isolation.
Observation,"I really like this game, it’s something different. But let’s be real the gameplay is very thin and I think a 6 or 7 is a more appropriate score. Reminds me of Observer, they even share a similar name. It’s an indie game set in one location mostly and it’s just something different, a cool experience from the standard AAA but I wouldn’t trip over my feet for it, it is in no way a 9"
Observation,Great review. I am gonna check this one out
Observation,"A female protagonist in a scif fi game about space exploration which is popular with and dominated by males is ludicrous and a turn off. Whats next, a female lumber jack simulator? Would you look askew at a male protagonist makeup game? Of course you would. This smacks of more obnoxious radical feminism promoting dystopian androgyny thats permeating all our entertainment now where all male leads must be replaced with females."
Observation,"wow, IGN is capable to do a proper review of a game???? and a score 9 that's not call of duty? here's my first ever like to IGN..."
Observation,*Ion storm detected near the station. Please check all AI controlled equipment.*
Observation,haha people thinking the station being in the wrong place is the real twist...
Observation,"Was going to make my purchase.

Not on Steam."
Observation,"I’m pleased that this game is being well received,I love single player horror/thriller games. This is a must buy for me lol"
Observation,I'm playing this right now . I discovered something and omg I've hot the biggest goosebumps ever !!! Faakkk what a suspense
Observation,"I'm so happy Simon finally got this, he's on the IGN UK Podcast. Definitely worth it."
Observation,"Just finished playing, the AI's name reminds me of Samantha Groves aka Root from POI."
Observation,"@0:36
Says ""series of cleverly designed puzzles""
Shows a ""puzzle"" where you just have to click on all the pink squares, just like it instructs you to."
Observation,I hate this types of games where you got to look at different cameras
Observation,"Amazing, IGN making nice reviews, this guy knows, 9 it a fair rate."
Observation,"I finished this game yesterday, took me around 8 hours, i got amazed by it, i got ZERO bugs, it's absolutely well done and implemented, a just love it, i can easily put this game at the same level as Subnautica with a 9.0 and i have the same feeling as subnautica that i would definitely play a continuation if they ever make it. There is Sub Zero in the Subnautica franchise but it's not a continuation it's a parallel story, kind of."
Observation,"I'm playing it now,A little scary (due to the background noise ) , very confusing game (solve the puzzles with no instructions.)"
Observation,im sorry is this IGN ??? wow ... nice review
Observation,Why couldn't it be on GoG.
Observation,"3:29 key phrase, this guy DID play the game so he can give a review..."
Observation,British reviewer giving a masterclass to his american colleagues.
Observation,Epic store only ruins it for me.
Observation,How hard can it be to activate AUTOMATIC SUBTITLES for your chanel? It's one click !
Observation,Listen to Cardy doing his serious voice! All grown up now bless him
Observation,On ps4 it has 5 1 star ratings......
Observation,I probably might get this game now
Observation,"i was excited, and wanted it......but its not on Steam.....sooo........"
Observation,"I don't understand why nobody is talking about the complete absence of objective clarity with some missions. 
One mission (no spoilers) tasked me with finding damage on the outside of the ship. Not only would it not accept multiple parts of the ship that were very clearly damaged, but the only acceptable goal was ONE specific little black 'scorch' mark on the side of a module that was almost hidden in darkness. Like wtf... I have to search the exterior of an entire space station for a little burn? Seriously? There isn't even a reminder of what module the damage COULD be found near."
Observation,"Detailed review by IGN, new guy knows how to review"
Observation,"Great game.  Most of the people bagging on the score obviously haven't played it, or if they have they didn't understand it and quit immediately."
Observation,Too bad it won't come out till next year
Observation,It was too slow for me.
Observation,LOL this is not a 9/10 ...
Observation,Sam Fisher?
Observation,Great review and agreed. I really enjoyed my time with this one. While there was some minor issues its hard to believe an 11 person studio delivered this. Must play for sure.
Observation,Boring games like this gets a higher score than alien isolation and doom.
Observation,"Girl voices kill it. Average teenage girls on space station LOL.

I like what game designers did with the station and some aesthetics, so it has that I guess."
Observation,"This looks interesting.
I just found out it's only on Epic though. Is it coming to Steam eventually or GoG?  I don't really want to support Epic."
Observation,Looks legit
Observation,really..9/10..r u kidding me..
Observation,"The game itself was interesting, but the plot disappointed me. There were too many plot holes and unexplained loose ends for my liking. A couple here and there is one thing, but when almost every major plot device/progression device is left unexplained and is just accepted as it is, that kind of bugs me. It's like asking how someone did something and responding ""because magic."" I am fine with a mystery/suspense oriented plot, but this felt like a mix between trying to hard to achieve something and not providing enough... not sure how else to explain that... Besides the plot-hole elements, I really enjoyed the rest of the game. It was a nice HAL-like mechanic."
Observation,wow a nine i might get it now its onsale throught epic for 12.49
Observation,Reminds me of The Turing Test.
Observation,I honestly haven't heard of it until today
Observation,Uk ign consistently put out bangers
Observation,6 hours long though... :(
Observation,"Great review Simon, thoroughly looking forward to this game!"
Observation,Do we know framerate and resolution for the pro version of this game?
Observation,"Big up Simon, great review mate. Looking forward to playing this one, looks excellent"
Observation,This game is..........FREAKIN AWESOME! (and stop it already with the Game of Thrones browser game ads DAMMIT)
Observation,More people need to play this so I can get some help on a mission that I HAVE NO Idea WHAT IM DOING
Observation,Not on steam = no buy
Observation,Wish this was in VR
Observation,📡📟💻🔆🔋🔌💣💳📉📈🎵🎬🌋👐🙏
Observation,9.0
Observation,"Fantastic review!, most people will say this game is boring at surface level and give a low score but you really learned the game and gave a proper review. Good work Simon."
Observation,I'm liking the new presentation of the review. Kinda Verge-esque.
Observation,You guys gave this the score days gone should of got
Observation,Thanks for the review. Doesn't look like this game is for me though. Thanks for saving me $6.24
Observation,Liked that game so much
Observation,ISS simulator.
Observation,"Clever, that comparison to HAL. I am growing tired of your quick wit.  You don't need to be the smartest guy in the room, right?"
Observation,"this is a fantastic in-depth review dude. it's not really enough to make me hit download in the gamepass store right now, I just wanted you to know I appreciate the work you put into this video 👍"
Observation,"I really want to like this game but the ""look for object in the room with little to no indication"" part just absolutely kills the fun"
Observation,Cool game for sure but I got lost so many times it was incredibly frustrating. Loved the story though
Observation,Finished this last night and rewatched the review. You nailed it. I agree with every single point you made... creepy almost. Guess i should grow out my beard.
Observation,So I am just floating around looking at stuff?
Observation,Epic timed exclusive = automatic wait for a deep deep sale on steam
Observation,Observation: an afternoon of quick time events.  I'd rather stick a pin in my eye.
Observation,Thank you bro!
Observation,"Now that it's on steam, I'm here to check it out. I love waiting for games that are out. I'm kidding epic needs to be stopped."
Observation,"Your reviews are great, as always. One thing I'd like to point out is the thing you said about the laptops. Well... go on google maps and take a tour of ISS and you'll see that the game actually reduces the number of laptops on board. It's insane just how many thinkpads they have up in the station. Definitely up to 30 or 40 (for 6 people!)."
Observation,"this graphics style makes me think of ""1999"""
Observation,"Seemed totally like my type of game, but it's actually the most fucking obtuse and frustrating thing I've played in a while. No guidance or even indication of what you're supposed to do, just guess and pixel hunt for the least obvious foreign objects that progress the story. It's reminds me of old adventure games where nobody could even be expected to solve some of this shit without even the slighest bit of guidance."
Observation,subbed. Thanks for this.
Observation,Hey it looks decent. Oh it's on epic. Pausing the video now and coming back if it comes to steam lol
Observation,Jon McKellan gave Alien: Isolation its perfect retro style aesthetic. He then went on to make Stories Untold and Observation. All excellent sci-fi/horror games that sometimes best the film counterparts. I like where this guy is heading. Eagerly anticipate his next project.
Observation,any difference on pc vs ps4?
Observation,"It was quite nice, I really liked it, I would have purchased it if it was on steam but yeah, epic store so I had to pirate it"
Observation,"Looks neat- oh, Epic Game Store?  Yeah, nevermind then."
Observation,"Just finished it, didn't like it at all. The twist was basic and the puzzles were such a drudge."
Observation,"I would buy it on GOG, Microsoft store or steam, not epic.
Will this be out on any of those at some point ?"
Observation,Aiiiiiiiiiiiin seen it 😂
Observation,"I just finished it, and enjoyed it a lot (at about $12). Satisfied a sci-fi fix I was going for. I'd call it a cinematic walking sim, since the puzzles were technically really easy, even if still potentially frustrating at times. 


The frustration added a bit to a sort of immersion I felt, given the scenario, although I _do_ honestly wish the ""repeat"" function could also help a little bit, at least as an option or something. I'm sure some people will be more put off by the frustrating times than I was."
Observation,"Once again, you weave a solid, no frill or BS review combined with some humor. Favorite reviewer!"
Observation,the fact that you called a fusion reactor - the supposed solution to our energy problems - an engine bothers me a bit
Observation,Please review Layers of fear 2
Observation,Definitely a fair review. I can wait for it to come to Game Pass or whatever
Observation,One of the worst games I ever came across. It was such a pain to play. Game design and gameplay is awful. Today's game developers don't know how to make good games.
Observation,"Observation on the PS4 has some moments of stuttering at some places but all together, it’s a flawlessly mind blowing experiencing that has a ton of replay value."
Observation,"First Stories Untold, and now this. No Code is looking to be a phenomenal new dev. Can’t wait to see their future products"
Observation,"Hello, do you think you could review the sequel of Bloodlust Shadowhunter, Bloodlust Nemesis?
Thank you!"
Observation,"Just refunded the game after running into game-breaking bugs. For one, I was able to use an inside control panel while I was outside and ended up glitching through the wall of a part of the station I was definitely not supposed to be in yet and couldn't get back out. I also don't understand why they didn't add volume settings in their game, not to mention the beginning issues with the language settings or the lack of them to be exact. Could've been good but unfortunately, it just isn't, at least for me."
Observation,I'd call it a floating simulator though ^^
Observation,"Its a must own game, just not through epic store, after all the bs and crap surrounding that shitehole, its not worth touching. I will wait for steam release and then buy it. Shame really, they would make so much more money. If you want to install litteral spyware on your machines with your accounts being banned after buying 2 games, then go get the epic launcher right now........The spyware thing is subjective, but there is way too much infomation about what they take to be brushed off as ""coincidence"". Such a shame, i wont be getting the outer worlds either because of the not so epic store. Great review as always ACG. I cant wait for their next game, these guys really do make original concepts."
Observation,"Unpopular opinion

I love the Epic store. 



They release the game....  takes the usual 6 - 12 months to actually fix it.  See honest reviews,  feedback then when they release it on Steam.   You can buy a complete game no having to pay no fix later bullshit.  

Considering I didnt buy Skyrim until 2016 Im very good at waiting.   
Let other fucking idiots waste time and money beta testing software.

Also lol Im not stupid enough to buy it on Epic!!!"
Observation,"Even most of the games you review I have 0 intrest in buying or time to play. 

Your reviews are brilliant best on YT."
Observation,How long is the average game last?
Observation,"""Oh shit this game looks pretty neat.""
*See it's epic exclusive""
""Well there goes my interest, thanks for saving me money I guess"""
Observation,I'm a sucker for walking sims and the combination of that with horror elements is just dynamite for me personally. More games like this need to exist. They just go to show that you don't need to be afraid of dying to be genuinely scared.
Observation,Google maps has a virtual tour of the ISS. There are literally hundreds of laptops all over the station.
Observation,WHERE IS THE PATHOLOGIC 2 REVIEW YA BUM!!! 🤬
Observation,Karak don't forget walking the walk videos!!!!!
Observation,Isn't SAM the name of the AI in the movie MOON?
Observation,"Good lord.  I love the devs, but won’t support the Epic bs, 
so I decided to go PS4, but after checking the 3 most likely outlets nearby, I don’t see a physical copy anywhere.  Did they really go Epic Store exclusive on PC and digital download ONLY on PS4?!  Someone please tell me I’m wrong..."
Observation,"Not on steam, easy skip."
Observation,Was ok finished it in 4 hours tho but got on sale so 8/10 for me.
Observation,"Epic store, I'm out"
Observation,"""and on the Epic store.""   The magic words that make me NOPE right out of any review video because I will never buy this game even when it does come to Steam in a year."
Observation,Only available on Epic store... Meeeeeeehh and Nope ..
Observation,Can u do darkwood
Observation,"Ugh, Epic crap, no way.  Maybe if at a discount anywhere (almost) other than Epic."
Observation,Not available on Steam or GOG. So nope.
Observation,"Loving this game, so happy the Devs are getting more money for it from putting it in the epic store! Can't wait to see more from this studio in the future."
Observation,"""On the epic store for PC.""

Welp, guess this is off my radar now."
Observation,"This is not a complaint, but time stamps to the various sections would be nice. On a lot of games I really just want your opinion on game play. 

Not sure if that hurts YouTube revenue by making it easier to skip parts of the video, but it would be nice."
Observation,As soon as you said Epic I was done.
Observation,"Hey man, love your reviews but i was wondering if you could add timestams to the different topics you cover? I'm mainly interested in gameplay and dont much care for graphics/sound and im sure other people are intested in other stuff they quickly want to jump to. Either way keep up the good work."
Observation,"I don't understand the appeal of walking simulators. A movie is better at conveying mood than such a game. 

As far as I'm concerned, you've taken the one thing out of the game that games have over other mediums = player agency."
Observation,Some of the team and cast from alien isolation worked on this game so I'm very interested
Observation,There are signs of injury to the station crew sounds like Samuel's form alien isolation
Observation,"I just got it for $8 and so far I think it's well invested money. First ""interactive movie"" game that actually grabs me."
Observation,Floating Simulator.
Observation,Add time stamps in bio
Observation,The USG Ishimura from Dead Space
Observation,"Didn't watch the video as I want it all to be a fresh experience...and a quick scan of the comments doesn't give me a good idea of what your verdict was...Buy, Wait, Never touch? I trust the recommendations coming from ACG."
Observation,You can score this right now for 12.49 through Epic's Mega Sale right now
Observation,The World Police puppet thing killed me
Observation,I want on xbox
Observation,"Lost all interest as soon as i heard ""epic games"""
Observation,Epic!!! Haha!!!
Observation,Epic store....automatic pass.  Not interested in Chinese govt spyware.
Observation,"Your videos are proof, that some ppl dislike videos only cos they are jerks."
Observation,Still gotta finish Plague Tale: Innocence due to your review of it
Observation,wow ... that made it all the way to 1 minute before becoming completely irelevant
Observation,"Just finished my first playthrough, really enjoyed the story."
Observation,Looks like garbage
Observation,I was with you until you said Epic store. Hoping for a future steam release 🤷‍♂️
Observation,"Loved Layers of Fear, this should be like that"
Observation,You can’t blast any aliens or nothing!?
Observation,204th to comment! Whoo!
Observation,Le NEEVO
Observation,"Coming to PlayStation, Xbox and Piratebay"
Observation,You lost me at Epic Store.
Observation,"Ah Epic exclusive a shame. TPB it is then.
Funny too coming from Devolver Digital always parodying the industry bs, looking forward to their next hypocritical E3 presentation"
Observation,"""And on PC it's on the epic store..."" and that's where the video ended for me."
Observation,I pre-ordered it. Game is awesome. Go buy the game. We need more games like this. Allyourbassarebelongtous. Bzzt......01..0...1.1.0
Observation,Im lovin it right now. Insta classic 👏👏👏😜
Observation,"This game is on sale at the Epic store for $12.49. So ""wait for a sale"" would be right now. If you like intense Sci-fi this is your huckleberry."
Observation,Looks better than fake nasa
Observation,I preordered it. A little worried you said this was a wait
Observation,"Epic Store?  Oh right, I'll check it out in a year then, byeeee"
Observation,LOL game comes out on Epic store...How are you sposed to even know it exists unless you play Fortnite??
Observation,No steam wtf. Pass
Observation,I thought you were referring to space station 13 at the beginning.
Observation,I’m sick of games like this. They’re boring as shit.
Observation,"By the end ""Wait for Sale"" will change into ""PLEAD TO NEVER TOUCH AND SUE FOR REFUND"" it's THAT bad."
Observation,Finished metro exodus and so sad. Need a new game to match it....
FTL: Faster Than Light,So I guess I mixed up the federation and rebellion for some reason. Don't know how I managed to do that when I have been playing this game for hours. Probably because I never beat the flagship anyways so whoops.
FTL: Faster Than Light,this looks like a spiritual successor to Sundog
FTL: Faster Than Light,I feel like Todd Howard took inspiration from this with Starfield.
FTL: Faster Than Light,"making a video about ftl and saying chased by federation, omg, you are the federation dude!"
FTL: Faster Than Light,It's TOO random. Sometimes the game just takes because bad dice roll and there's no opportunity for the player to solve or even mitigate. Skill isn't enough to succeed.
FTL: Faster Than Light,the trekkiest game that was never star trek. fine for the want for that space diplomacy and spaceship fights.
FTL: Faster Than Light,FTL my beloved
FTL: Faster Than Light,8:08 Ever Get That Feeling?
FTL: Faster Than Light,Now u can actually play it in vr chat xD
FTL: Faster Than Light,"I found out about this game in airplane, when my seat neighbour played FTL on his tablet, and only now I find the name of this game"
FTL: Faster Than Light,I died in the tutorial 😂
FTL: Faster Than Light,"6:17 You say that and yet you've never even played it. The game has rised millions of dollars, because people want to see it succeed, not because they were swindled into giving their money to it."
FTL: Faster Than Light,"This overrated “game” has been fisted by Obey the Fist, the almighty savior and the most honest steam reviewer on the platform!!"
FTL: Faster Than Light,did you beat the game tho
FTL: Faster Than Light,"Welp, good thing you and your pal Kyle share something in common by sucking at games you both enjoy to play"
FTL: Faster Than Light,I found FTL trough my brother who played it on the family computer and once i got it for myself i absolutley loved it.
FTL: Faster Than Light,"awesome video, really. just found FTL through a friend a few weeks ago and it is truly one of the best games ive played in a while. so simple yet so fun, as you said, easy to learn yet tough to master. 10/10"
FTL: Faster Than Light,"Something I love about the game is the pause button. It makes managing an RTS type game way more casual, but you can also just opt not to use it if you really want to challenge yourself"
FTL: Faster Than Light,Rebels are chaising you...
FTL: Faster Than Light,As soon as I heard him say you were being pursued by the Federation my brain immediately went into fight or flight mode.
FTL: Faster Than Light,"I find it important to mention the glory of MODS. Because of FTL's rather simplistic nature, it's fairly easy to mod for people with the necessary talents in programming and art. Sometimes you get little mods that remove the rebel fleet, meaning you can visit every beacon in every sector, 1-7, or make the game harder while adding a few new and interesting weapons (Captain's Edition, for example), or even completely overhaul and convert the game to the point it's barely recognizable.

One such conversion mod that's worth mentioning is Multiverse. I will never understand why I have only recently learned of Multiverse, because it takes the quality of the base game and ramps it up to 1000. It's more balanced than CE, contains more content than many other mods combined, and it has the absolute gigaslug trader, real OG, potential mini-boss himself, Sylvan. Oh, and speaking of Sylvan, there are alternate endings beyond ""destroy le multiverse flagship,"" and thanks to the Hyperspace mod, which it relies on, you have more unlockable ships than you can count on all of your fingers and toes. The Multiverse ships are all pretty balanced, with the more gimmicky and fun ships locked away. Some of those gimmicky ships are just like base FTL, relying on, say, boarding, like Mantis B and C, or maybe having a massively upgraded artillery weapon but lacking a powerful weapon system, like Fed B. Some of them, like Merchant B, are just insanely op and satisfying to use, given you snowball them correctly. Some, like the Wrecked Bomber or Unoptimized Cruiser, are absolute garbage and meant to be challenge ships. The mod also encourages you to explore the alternate storylines instead of bum-rushing the flagship and finishing the game, by locking many of those shiny new ships behind completing certain events or quests.

Now, because of the previously mentioned Hyperspace mod, Multiverse is a bit more convoluted to install than, say, Infinite Space. However, it does still use Slipstream Mod Manager to get Hyperspace running (don't forget to put the Hyperspace files into the game directory and use the downgrader batch first), and Multiverse has an installer you can use if you're on Windows. Either way, it's absolutely worth a try (read: playing FTL for several hundred more hours because it's even more addictive than unmodded FTL) if you ever have the time."
FTL: Faster Than Light,"Don't forget about the insane number of mods that took years and months of development.

Oh yes, and the soundtrack."
FTL: Faster Than Light,Ok going out of your way to throw shade at star citizen made me lol
FTL: Faster Than Light,2:32 your being persuied by the rebelion not the federation. you are the federation
FTL: Faster Than Light,yes i am awersome
FTL: Faster Than Light,"When I first got into this game, it was when I was discussing into the breach (another game by the FTL devs) with a friend. They talked about FTL and I got into it. Played only hard and sucked horribly. Had a blast, watched some tutorials and tips videos then I went back into the game and beat it 6 times and unlocked 9/10 different ships and a couple alternate layouts. Me and my other friends that play this game will just chill in a call and stream so we can check in on each others’ games and it’s super fun. I’ve beaten the game the most of all my FTL friends, they only just recently started winning (on easy for us all obviously lol).
Mike Hopley is a super cool FTL YouTuber and guide maker. Check him out for tips"
FTL: Faster Than Light,best indi game is crashlands
FTL: Faster Than Light,"FTL got me like: ""I hate this game. Time for another run!"""
FTL: Faster Than Light,Heck try the game with some mods and it will become AWESOME! [Would recommend downloading the MULTIVERSE mod]
FTL: Faster Than Light,"Just beat the flagship, my god the cloak is annoying"
FTL: Faster Than Light,In 2022 i still recommend
FTL: Faster Than Light,Is there a mod so you can save and reload the game before you mess up? The normal state is a mess since if one thing goes wrong your entire game is wrecked. And the slightest accident can mess up hours of work.
FTL: Faster Than Light,"I really love games where your actions have consequences and where you can create your own story like FTL (and Crusader Kings 3). FTL is Ironman by default - some people might not like this at first, but it's an essential part of the experience and it forces you to experiment when you fail."
FTL: Faster Than Light,"Good video. Played this game a lot when it first came out. played it... A LOT. Havent played it in a long while but I have very fond memories of my runs. Regardless of my testimonial of this game, this game is truly one of the best games ever made whether anyone likes it or not."
FTL: Faster Than Light,Its rebel who is chassing you
FTL: Faster Than Light,"Personally, I can't play for just 20 minutes. I have to finish a run. It's very addictive. I'm 60 hours in after 4 weeks, unlocked all ships and variants except for the crystal ship.
It's a gem but only pick it up if you have a lot of free time."
FTL: Faster Than Light,"a youtuber Andrew Colunga made his own story and he made almost 40 episodes and iI really like it it is very exiting i suggest to you to go watch every episode you will love it"
FTL: Faster Than Light,"i was a blind four year old playing a paper jamz before, i was much better than that literal sponge of a human"
FTL: Faster Than Light,"As an FTL player, the base game is merely scratching the surface, once you get into playing mods it's even more fun, additional weapons and the ease of the slipstream mod menu make mixing this game up with community content a breeze, I've played modded for so long I struggle to play vanilla because I love all of the modded content, multiverse and CE are some of the most fun I've had with this game since I dumped hours into learning just the base game."
FTL: Faster Than Light,i got the game for free on epic but then decided to buy it on steam because of how much i loved it (also because epic doesnt have achievements)
FTL: Faster Than Light,1:29... level 3 shields... THAT'S CURSED.
FTL: Faster Than Light,"This game is great. It's horrifically difficult, but fun."
FTL: Faster Than Light,Rip
FTL: Faster Than Light,"I hate this game but I like to comeback to it even every day. It's beacuse I died at boss fight 17th time in row. I just want to destroy it. I must admit your great cideo gave me more dun from this game, beacuse i'm lokking on it in other way. Thanks <3"
FTL: Faster Than Light,"YOU are the federation. THEY are Rebels, you played the game..never mind"
FTL: Faster Than Light,"I had no idea FTL was made by two dudes, that makes it even cooler! My favourite playstyle is getting a massive boarding crew plus some of the anti personel weapons and basically scraping half the sectors ships to buy sweet weapons and upgrades to fight the boss with ."
FTL: Faster Than Light,Um 1:11 ...  xD
FTL: Faster Than Light,I PLAYED THIS GAME IN 2014. I lost it to my young mind forgetting the name and have driven myself insane for years not knowing that it was anything more than a cool iPad game. I’m buying it on steam as we speak. Thankyou for bringing one of my favorite childhood games back to me & letting me enjoy it again
FTL: Faster Than Light,"There's a new game out that's basically FTL but with 3d space battles,  called Between the Stars"
FTL: Faster Than Light,"Four shields, two 3shot lasers and two railguns equals easy win."
FTL: Faster Than Light,77 hours on Steam and at least that many on iPad.  Yes I bought FTL twice.
FTL: Faster Than Light,I wish this game would come to Switch. I would probably lose entire days to this game again if it was portable.
FTL: Faster Than Light,"It humors me that 99% of the reasons people give for why the love this game, can also be counted as why people hate this game including me. Perspective i guess"
FTL: Faster Than Light,This guy has crazy intonation.
FTL: Faster Than Light,Oops that's 8 more hours in FTL :/
FTL: Faster Than Light,My experience with frogs that laugh? Well. I'm starting to win hardmode runs now and I'd like to win hardmode with every ship. I won easy mode with every ship before getting every achievement. Right now I'm trying hardmode stealth c because it's the worst ship. Absolutely mental time it's been. Died to the last phase last night that really stung. No joke my first victory was like doing a hit of some kinda drug just a huge RUSH of euphoria. A similar feeling to my first kiss actually. A warning. Hard mode might actually turn you insane. Rng gets replaced by an ai that deliberately tries to end your run asap. That's how it feels anyway. Here's some advice nuggets. You can exploit hacking past any defense/anti drone drones (look up the exploit). Get buffer upgrades. Flak 1 is the best weapon. Try to get 4 of them. Always get hacking. Clone Bay plus boarding equals a fun time. Can a ship not hit you? Sit for 5 minutes and train your guys. Maybe take a break and drink tea/stretch. The game will really make you mad.
FTL: Faster Than Light,"my experience with FTL
i never bought it i use my friend's shared library for it
and even then i believe





This game is AMAZING. I love it with literally everything I have. Originally, I DESPISED rogue-likes and strategy games, thinking they were ""too hard"" and ""too pressuring"" or ""too unacceptable for new players"". But FTL is a whole other pack of soy-sauce filled macaroni. This game is a godsend especially for me getting through quarantine. It provides constant hours of fun and enjoyment, and though I still haven't unlocked all the ships yet, I've been having one of the best times I've ever had playing a game in my life. Seriously, I love FTL so much. It's music bops, it's gameplay is smooth and easy for any computer to run, it's graphics meld perfectly with the pixel/digital art mixing well, and just thousands of other things that I wanna list but I don't wanna be here all day. In short...
Last Stand is a bop,
The Federation is the best,
and stop comparing FTL to Star Wars. (if you do this i will come to your house and eat your 2-year leftovers in the fridge)
Sincerely, and best regards,
StarNeverDoes."
FTL: Faster Than Light,"I think this game is good for a couple hours or so but it's one of the most overrated games I've ever played. It's very short, I was expecting this huge epic and it's literally less than 2 hours long.  Totally overrated game. Enjoyable for a bit for sure, but no long-term value in my opinion and has all the frustrations of a rogue-like game that wants you to struggle every minute of playing"
FTL: Faster Than Light,"It's just a Roguelike, not a Roguelike-like."
FTL: Faster Than Light,WHERE IS FTL 2 !?!
FTL: Faster Than Light,"I love this game so much that like 3 yrs ago i decided to build lego ftl ships. I didnt want to buy the mugbearers instructions for them, so i spent hours and hours looking at pictures of his ships and ships in game and built nearly every one, and i think they look really good. To this day i still kept them lol."
FTL: Faster Than Light,Have you tried Out There: Omega Edition? It's a similar game to FTL but remove the fighting and more on decision making and management.
FTL: Faster Than Light,"""Are we the baddies?""  Me right before I blow up every single ship instead of accepting their surrender, or board them and kill their entire crew without mercy, because I want more scrap $$"
FTL: Faster Than Light,"FTL is the best Rouge-Like i played. The reason is that every run is fun. If i play enter the gungeon or slay the spire (to name two other great ones), my fun is greatly dependend on what items i get. To powerful and it's boring, to weak and it's frustrating. But in FTL every item is useful and can open new ways to play the game. 

I hated it the first 6h, and i loved it the other 200h+"
FTL: Faster Than Light,This game helped me get through high school
FTL: Faster Than Light,completely agree with your thought on issac I'm very bad at issac and don't have much fun I only bought the game to mod it and do challenges where I set all my starting items using the debug mode
FTL: Faster Than Light,when I play the restart button is cursed I always lose on the fourth sector when I hit restart
FTL: Faster Than Light,This game looks boring af
FTL: Faster Than Light,you should look at the FTL cartoon that was made by a fan of the game!
FTL: Faster Than Light,"Mantis
Mantis
Mantis 
😃"
FTL: Faster Than Light,"My experience with FTL:
Last time I youtubed it, I recorded in one full stream, my 'missile only run' and won.
 So yes it's a good game."
FTL: Faster Than Light,One of the best game ever
FTL: Faster Than Light,"I honestly found it very frustrating. It takes like one to two hours just to die in the bossfight and to start over again.
It had fun moments and felt very rewarding when you beat the flagship though"
FTL: Faster Than Light,"Remember that first time you defeat the flagship




I almost shat my pants"
FTL: Faster Than Light,Games so good you forgot you play as the federation racing toward the home system before the big bad rebel ship does and blow it up. You are the empire in this game.
FTL: Faster Than Light,"Can't beat the game on Normal, but too stubborn to play on Easy."
FTL: Faster Than Light,"3:40 There are ten cruisers, each of which have 3 layouts (two cruisers have two layouts), totalling 28 ships."
FTL: Faster Than Light,"the gameplay in the background is killing me, you're as bad at ftl as your friend was at guitar hero"
FTL: Faster Than Light,"Awesome? Get real kid, it sucks."
FTL: Faster Than Light,What do you mean by 4 year old blind kid can't playing a guitar?
FTL: Faster Than Light,you got scammed so hard i bought it for 1 euro :3
FTL: Faster Than Light,FTL is just what happens after you take off in rimworld
FTL: Faster Than Light,this game is on of the worst umbalanced game ever and whover says it is a good game should get killed in rlf with developers
FTL: Faster Than Light,"My experience with FTL is, getting double glaive beamed by a tiny interceptor, trading with slugs... so, they take your fuel and leave you to die from the rebel fleet. 2 Terminator boarding drones gunning down your crew while you can’t pierce the enemy shields... Ooh there’s also missing every shot in your salvo on the boss, giving me severe PTSD...

All around, a great game 👍"
FTL: Faster Than Light,I wouldn't mind playing it.... if it wasn't for the fact that it's so butt ugly.
FTL: Faster Than Light,1:10 - I don't see any comments about this clip that's on the TV. Does nobody know what that is!? 😂
FTL: Faster Than Light,Into the breach Is not as good as FTL unfortunately
FTL: Faster Than Light,I wonder why this git ported only to ios...
FTL: Faster Than Light,"Bought it today, spent 7 hours on it. Help"
FTL: Faster Than Light,whenever i get in a fight in ftl I always put a person in cams to see the people in the ship panicing. IDK just think it's kinda funny
FTL: Faster Than Light,You never win playing FTL. You are allowed to get delusional :- D
FTL: Faster Than Light,Check out Tachyon
FTL: Faster Than Light,You never used the doors the god killers
FTL: Faster Than Light,"I appreciate how you use storytelling in your videos. It's clear you write and edit your scripts.
I'm really over people just hitting record and yapping on for 25 minutes"
FTL: Faster Than Light,This sounds awful
FTL: Faster Than Light,I love the game but I got kind of tired of dying over and over lol. Currently playing their next game Into The Breach and loving that too! I love these devs so much
FTL: Faster Than Light,"all i could think watching this was ""USE THE FUCKING DOORS"""
FTL: Faster Than Light,"On sale for less than $3 right now on steam! I also highly suggest to try it out! It's so cheap, you have nothing to lose!"
FTL: Faster Than Light,Star citizen is not a scam its the most epic game ever
FTL: Faster Than Light,Crystal B....
FTL: Faster Than Light,I've never watched a FTL video before but I'm glad youtube recommended me your channel tonight. Keep on keeping on brother
FTL: Faster Than Light,"an FTL review in the year of our lord 2023, nice"
FTL: Faster Than Light,"omg how i love FTL, played a lot of time, runs, unlocked almost everything, so mucho fun. Maybe u know but a similar game called Convoys,  very similar to FLT and tons of fun too."

😶
☹"
FTL: Faster Than Light,"I has 33+ hours in FTL, and I never beat the final boss once (his second stage at least). This game is a RNG mess. But I like the music."
FTL: Faster Than Light,Did you escape SsethTzeentach's basement?
FTL: Faster Than Light,0:10 i agree with that marine

FTL: Faster Than Light,"Verac is going to become the next seeth, mark my words. Hes got it all. The edgy memes, the editing, the autism.

Especially the autism."
FTL: Faster Than Light,0/5. Not a single giant alien spider.
FTL: Faster Than Light,I enjoyed listening to Cave Johnson educate me on the Space Geneva Convention.
FTL: Faster Than Light,FTL XCOM EW and civ are what really got me into gaming. I’m glad to see this game getting the love it needs
FTL: Faster Than Light,You should check out reassembly
FTL: Faster Than Light,"Here are two tips that work wonders for every run I try:

1) Don't upgrade your reactor early on. Encounter difficulty is based on a combination of how many sectors you've progressed and how much you've upgraded the reactor. If you can avoid upgrading your reactor as long as possible (careful management, recruiting glowy bois, etc) then you ensure the first few sectors are less risky. Even better if you:

2) Upgrade your shields to level 2 as soon as possible. Many early enemies lack the fire power to punch through two layers of shielding AND do real damage before the shields come back up. Not taking hull damage early means you don't lose your precious early scrap to tons of repairs. If your power feels a bit low, you can always pull from engines: dodging doesn't matter if you can tank hits. Just make sure to target enemy weapons systems ASAP if they have missiles, since those bypass your shields."
FTL: Faster Than Light,11:37 Omnissiah haha nice. Love Mechanicus by the way.

FTL: Faster Than Light,"Despite knowing this game in and out, having put it away after exhausting everything in vanilla to experience, I still watch this in full. Very entertaining."
FTL: Faster Than Light,"Cool video! We really love FTL, so we decided to start working on a similar game."
FTL: Faster Than Light,"Words cannot describe how much money i would pay for a cross between FTL, sea of thieves, and outer wilds. Some dev in the comments make it happen"
FTL: Faster Than Light,1:09 nice advice. if you're happen to be on a dictatorship don't ask questions it will be better for your life.
FTL: Faster Than Light,"""I've never read the Geneva Convention so I'm sure its fine"" is such a perfect summary of the decisions you get to make"

FTL: Faster Than Light,"A note on the rebels vs federation and who the ""good guy"" is. The rebels are depicted as brutal racists/xenophobes and human supremacists. As bad as the federation can be, I doubt it's worse than the rebels."

FTL: Faster Than Light,"16:06 This tier list hurts my eyes. Who the Hell puts Glaive Beam in C tier?
It's not the only issue but seriously wtf lol

Also you forgot to mention that the music is fucking nuts."
FTL: Faster Than Light,15:09 for those who want the weapon tier list
FTL: Faster Than Light,Amount of fan service content is glorious

FTL: Faster Than Light,Cursed Gaia Online Captain Picard. I thought I'd never see it again and I hope that to be true. Even here that website haunts me.
FTL: Faster Than Light,9:30 you measure it with a ruler you extra made for this game!^^
FTL: Faster Than Light,This game is incredibly punishing. One bad fight/unlucky fire or invasion can ruin you.
FTL: Faster Than Light,I want to have sex with that toaster so bad

FTL: Faster Than Light,"“Giant alien spiders” Miss Muffet, that you?"
FTL: Faster Than Light,send me to spider planet captain! I'll smash them all!
FTL: Faster Than Light,"Worth mentioning that the game also has a couple of really good mods that extend the gamplay while keeping it roughly the same. ""Captains Edition"" and ""Multiverce"". Give em a google if you are done with the base game."
FTL: Faster Than Light,Can I pet your magnificent fluffy ears?
FTL: Faster Than Light,Cover Barotrauma
FTL: Faster Than Light,"Oh also
On one of the events I found out the Rebels are xenophobes
That gives me every single reasons to commit great violation of the Geneva Convention
You aren't a xenophobe, right?"
FTL: Faster Than Light,"14:04 Always always and I mean ALWAYS get a redundancy point in oxygen systems whenever you play or you might have an oopsie and your entire crew will die from oxygen deprivation if the system gets damaged. Whenever your ship gets invaded, put a crew inside the door control room to make it easier to lock intruders in. Missiles are strong as hell (and for that same reason annoying) as they pierce shields *except for the zultan one*."

FTL: Faster Than Light,Trinston was here
FTL: Faster Than Light,could you review Heat Signature?
FTL: Faster Than Light,"Yeahhhhh this is easily one of the most entertaining FTL vid I've seen so far. Damn great job.

Also, anti-bio beams supremacy"
FTL: Faster Than Light,"Drinking game. Every time Verac says captain take a shot.
Embrace alcohol posioning."
FTL: Faster Than Light,Wait is the thumbnail a jerma joke?
FTL: Faster Than Light,"And of course, according to YouTube, the most replayed section is the Veracsplaining bit.

Love it."
FTL: Faster Than Light,0/10 needs more sexy alien spiders
FTL: Faster Than Light,"Yeah, you made me horny for giant spider people. Dunno if I should thank you or curse you"
FTL: Faster Than Light,"So, quick explanation on how the different races act:
Humans: Rebels are usually violent jerks, normal folk are just normal space people, Federation is like the one in Star Trek and don’t know what you’ve done yet, other than fight murderous pirates and rebels. Boy are they gonna be pissed….
Zoltan: imagine Q’s questioning humanity, with more zen feel. These guys are the spiritual folk of the galaxy. Except that one you can meet that’s insane.
Mantis: everything Verac said but worse. The Hunt is religion, Prey is bountiful, Violence is inevitable.
Engi: everything Verac said, just Data/robot style nerds. If machine use bot.
Rockman: eat rocks and collect scrap, also pirates
Slugs: the Ferengi, love to force deals, love ambush’s more. I’m with Verac on them, they’re worse than the Bugs. Mostly cause they attack in nebulas, where half your systems might be off.
Those weird metal guys: Verac already said.
Remember, someone screaming surrender doesn’t excuse shooting missiles at you till your half health, or killing most of your crew."
FTL: Faster Than Light,"Yo Verac, you got a discord server people can join?"
FTL: Faster Than Light,This thumbnail and spider appreciation reminds me of a certain Undertale animation and it’s a good one
FTL: Faster Than Light,also the star federation mod in starsector is a fantastic homage as it has a lot of the ships nd weapons in the hell that is the persian sector
FTL: Faster Than Light,"FTL: Sure, it's a decade old and has the literal grand scope plot line of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, but it's aged very well, runs on basically anything, and is a fantastic comfort game.
And after having beaten the game with EVERY ship layout, I don't seem to get bored of it. (on Easy, admittedly - some ship layouts like Slug B, Mantis C, and Stealth C are a major challenge)"
FTL: Faster Than Light,There is no Geneva in Space.
FTL: Faster Than Light,"FTL is hilariously grim when you realize ""Information that cannot be transferred wirelessly"" could be Federation-speak for *hostage*"
FTL: Faster Than Light,"As someone who just picked up the game, thank you so much for the weapon tiers at 16:08!  One of the first guns I picked up was a chain ion because it sounded cool and I did not know that Ion damage was so very bad"
FTL: Faster Than Light,"Just found this video on the feed, saw all the muffets, subscribed immediately, I would be FOOLISH not to follow a man with such FINE taste."
FTL: Faster Than Light,an event reveals the rebels as not liking the federation because non-humans have equal rights. so uh. actually the good guys?
FTL: Faster Than Light,Wanna review Subverse next ?
FTL: Faster Than Light,My Ipad2 has/d like 300-500 hours on this game...
FTL: Faster Than Light,"Great, now I am afraid of Slugs violating my An--!"
FTL: Faster Than Light,"I reached once the sector 8, and fight 2 times the boss, but 3third time I lose QWQ"
FTL: Faster Than Light,"pause button, if you want to turn a rts game in a turn-based strategy game"
FTL: Faster Than Light,this is the second time I've heard the word captain used so many times in a video. *Cough* Markiplier in Space *cough*
FTL: Faster Than Light,this reminds me alot of crying suns

FTL: Faster Than Light,CAN I GET A ROCK AND STONE?
FTL: Faster Than Light,"The first time I ever won this dang game, probably last year after playing since forever, was with that anti-bio beam! Why destroy a ship when I can just deactivate it and murder everyone inside from a safe distance?"
FTL: Faster Than Light,"Sseth, Toastoffire, Max0r, Verac, and Mandalore. The Holy Quintity."
FTL: Faster Than Light,"It's called ""human"" rights for a reason."
FTL: Faster Than Light,"Friendly Reminder that the Rebels are Human Supremicists. Ever wonder why You only see humans on Rebel ships?
also fellow Haaru Enjoyer."
FTL: Faster Than Light,alien spider mamas. Muffet approved
FTL: Faster Than Light,This video convinced to try FTL. I regret this decision.
FTL: Faster Than Light,Sseth is proud
FTL: Faster Than Light,"I got the game yesterday because of this video and i begin to value doors more and more every playthrough.
Your ship is on fire? Open the airlock and open the doors so that the fire dies out due to lack of air!
Intruders? Use doors!
The only problem with overusing airlocks and doors i find is that it's risky during combat as you are actively blocking off bits of your ship by opening an airlock. I was so overwhelmed with fire and intruders one time that after i destroyed the enemy ship which was causing the havoci airlocked the entirity of my ship ecxept for one room so all the aliens and fire go away"
FTL: Faster Than Light,Nah this mans editing is underrated 💯
FTL: Faster Than Light,High quality content. Thank you funny wolf(?) man
FTL: Faster Than Light,Muffet
FTL: Faster Than Light,"My favorite part of the video was when Verac said ""It's veracsplaining time"" and veracsplained all over those guys"
FTL: Faster Than Light,10/10 but the video should've been four hours longer
FTL: Faster Than Light,Veracsplaining this fills the game knowledge into my brain (This is the 3rd time watching and still counting and funny cultural images and it be funny if someone happen to put down the original artist of those art here)
FTL: Faster Than Light,"heh, giant spiders"
FTL: Faster Than Light,">roguelike-like
>it's not like games like rogue
>it's not like rogue"
FTL: Faster Than Light,Man is ftl that old now damn
FTL: Faster Than Light,"This video reminded me that pathway exist. It is heavily FTL influenced, I relly like the setting like ww2 africa indiana jones wannabe pulp fiction. Highly recommend."
FTL: Faster Than Light,"I really like the modding scene of this game
you can make female characters appear more in the game, because apparently that's a thing with a low chance of happening
or you can make so instead of the basic guns you can have weapons such as... uhhh... ion gatling gun? that is a strong one"
FTL: Faster Than Light,"you can also kill every single crew in the rebel flagship
only to then realize it has an automated fighting system and it's now unable to fix any damage at all :)"
FTL: Faster Than Light,"i really love this kinda videos, the commentary is kinda feral and chaotic, 
like beeing out with a friend in a bar that permanent calls out trouble 
and your r sittn there and just wait for the trouble to arrive with kinda exitment..."
FTL: Faster Than Light,I wish i was faster than light and also a mantis person
FTL: Faster Than Light,Quad flack 1 op
FTL: Faster Than Light,You should have REALLY tried out *FTL: Multiverse* its a complete overhaul of the original game with bunch more features
Firewatch,"This reviewer gets it. It's the power of an emotional connection told through storytelling, and this game really nails it. Games like these have the capability to tell a story we can relate to more than a high budget hollywood production can. And on that merit alone, it deserves all the praise it has received."
Firewatch,Awesome review Ryan! You nailed it!
Firewatch,The story is fictional but the NF exist
Firewatch,This is my favourite game ever
Firewatch,"Incredible game, one of the best And most enjoyable games I’ve played"
Firewatch,"Very disappointing game.  I’m normally into games that are a little different, but this did absolutely nothing for me.  There’s a little bit of a contrived plot going on, but not even that is answered.  

Limited controls, forced movements, tiny map, no real plot… Not sure how this game got such high ratings."
Firewatch,"Firewatch, the game where you run faster going zig-zagging diagonally rather than straight ahead."
Firewatch,"Nice review, just wanted to rebuttal a small critique you made at 1:10 about lack of wildlife potentially breaking the illusion. Having personally backpacked in the Wyoming wilderness for 3 months a few years ago it was crazy (almost weird) the lack of wildlife. Some birds, squirrels and some goats on the Plateaus there it was pretty much desolate of wildlife."
Firewatch,Who else became interested in this because they played the Stanley Parable?
Firewatch,Romance girl
Firewatch,Wow
Firewatch,breathedge and the subnauticas are better
Firewatch,Enjoyed the stylized look and the voice acting was done well but after the hype it was over quickly and no reason to replay
Firewatch,More like FlirtWatch 😂
Firewatch,The ending is sick idk what u lot are talking about
Firewatch,Looks boring
Firewatch,xbox game pass soon
Firewatch,"flashlight: they should update it, showing hand holding it, for more immersion."
Firewatch,This game is Never on sale!!! Its 5 years old why! I've always wanted to play but not full price
Firewatch,How many hours does it take to finish this game in the first blind play-through?
Firewatch,Don’t buy this game on PS4!! The stuttering is ridiculous and ruins the experience.
Firewatch,"No mention of the significant stuttering issues on PS4. Completely ruins immersion in a game, where that’s the whole idea... Useless review. Still a decent game though (that could have been great on PS4)"
Firewatch,that ending though reminds me of HER and LA LA LAND
Firewatch,Like Inside this game stays with you for a long time.
Firewatch,Yeah bro honestly 2016 is the beat year if all time. It really can’t get better.
Firewatch,This is the safest 10 I have ever given a game
Firewatch,anyone else find similar tone between firewatch and the vast of night?
Firewatch,I'm in love with Del
Firewatch,I saw not 1 fire tho
Firewatch,Im about to play through it again 😂 I do it about every year lol
Firewatch,10/10
Firewatch,I love this game and I am highly anticipating their new work!
Firewatch,If there’s any game where I could erase my memory and replay again for how the story had me GLUED it would be this game!
Firewatch,the game was amazing until the end mystery is solved. its a bit underwhelming.
Firewatch,"DO NOT buy this game. It's a bug fest that has bugs crippling it years after it was released. I suspect big reviewers were asked to keep quiet about this, because there's tons upon tons of reports that are ignored for four years now.
DO NOT BUY. This is garbage."
Firewatch,Best trailer of that year
Firewatch,"Anticlimactic...


Yeah, that's how life is.
That how the reality is."
Firewatch,Australia California and Oregon: seems legit
Firewatch,Romance girl.
Firewatch,Wow.
Firewatch,"I don't understand how one person can build his own fenced camp and surveillance, two people. All the while the guy has no reason to write reports on them. The ending makes no sense, that is not 'realism'."
Firewatch,"The purpose of the ending is to make you sad not disappointing. most people wanted what Delilah look like because she is a flirty, charismatic b*tch lol!"
Firewatch,One of the Best games of the decade
Firewatch,Telling us the ending is disappointing *is* a spoiler. Just don't touch it.
Firewatch,"just finished the game, it was am amazing, would highly reccomend"
Firewatch,"It is great game! But yes, I agree that the ending is a bit ... meh. Not a disappointing ending, but a bit anticlimatic. Also the game could be just a little bit longer. Regardsless, you should play it if you haven't. I wouldn't call it a ""walking simulator"". They is a lot to do, So,It is worth your cash!  Enjoy it! Games like this is SO rare."
Firewatch,This game made me realize what a scumbag I am.  I was willing to cheat on my wife with Delilah.  This was a great way to spend my shift at work tonight tho.
Firewatch,"I've seen many comments bashing the ending. For me, it was a perfect ending. If you have doubts about playing the game, don't.  Just play it. It will be worth it.

Spoilers below.

Not everything has to be supernatural, or a massive government conspiracy.  The theme of the game is guilt. Henry's guilt for abandoning Julia, Delilah's guilt about letting the kid be, and the father's guilt about his dead son. This game is masterful from start to finish. The story is as real as it gets."
Firewatch,best movie ive ever played
Firewatch,This game is on sale for $5.99 on the Nintendo eShop right now!!!
Firewatch,Who else is here because its 5 bucks on the eshop
Firewatch,The main character sounds like Andy Richter...
Firewatch,Review didn't really explain what kind of game this is.
Firewatch,"the anti climatic ending is realism tho. it was the henry and delilah overthinking things, the brian part was a punch in the gut tho"
Firewatch,The ending is actually amazing.
Firewatch,This game was a masterclass in writing!
Firewatch,"""Branching script""? Nothing you chose had any effect on the plot as a whole. You either tell Delihla that Julia was a prof at Yale or she stayed at home, you love your wife either way, unleass you decide that you like delihla better. Any changes are only comsmetic and dialog is just slightly diffrent based on your choices, but ulitmatly conveys the same meaning."
Firewatch,"""Writing is just head and shoulders over any other game I played"" but, but... it's just a long dialog and one o.k. mystery. There are games that have tens of plots like this in the whole game with better graphics and more enjoyable gameplay. I mean I'm awfull at witcher 3 but here it's just pull up a map, pull up a radio, go somewhere and pick something."
Firewatch,Has it been physical or is it just download?
Firewatch,It’s 2020 and I just bought it for 2.99 I’m not complaining only done the first chapter can’t wait to see how it pans out ! 🙂
Firewatch,It’s $6 on the PSN store at the moment!!
Firewatch,This game was pretty chill. Never got anywhere deep enough for me though. Ended before I felt like it really got into it.
Firewatch,In-game tip: Press Alt+F4 for help
Firewatch,"Man, I love this game"
Firewatch,"I played through this game two years ago, but recently been thinking about it. Came here to remind me why I should play it again."
Firewatch,I actually liked the simple ending and the fact that wasn't some russian invasion (because cold war era) or something like this going on.
Firewatch,Why am I watching this during a thunderstorm
Firewatch,great game but the ending was kinda sad ngl
Firewatch,Turt Rynolds is better
Firewatch,The ending is actually my favorite part. Just because it wasn't finished 😉
Firewatch,"3:25
Shelley Duvall does look a bit like a turtle."
Firewatch,"Some people call it a boring ""walking sim"" those are the kind of people that is blind to art, Beauty, feelings, everything. Its those people who sleeps with a Gun under the pillow. Its those people who hates, disrespects everything.
Its those people who prefer jennifer anniston.
This is one of the best Most atmospheric games ive played. And yeah its worth its price. Cause firewatch is proof that games as a medium is art. 10/10"
Firewatch,"What an annoying voice to listen, hope this guy have already fired"
Firewatch,Literally my only complaint is that it was over too quickly
Firewatch,It was ok. Delyla never show tiddy. Minus 5 point.
Firewatch,F
Firewatch,"This game looks so beautiful. I watched Jeff Favignano play it when I was 16, now I finally get to play it."
Firewatch,And I watch this again and again
Firewatch,I don’t know I’m in love with this game
Firewatch,"A really great game that subverts expectations of murderers and government conspiracy to something much less fantastical but much more grounded and real, which helps the message of facing your problems to really hit home and feel much more personal. Every character in the game is running away from something. Henry is running from facing his wife, Delilah is avoiding her boyfriend after the murder of his brother, and Ned is running from having to cope with his sons death. It’s a story that needs multiple playthroughs, and the ending is definitely not a bad thing. This game should be a 10/10"
Firewatch,Was that a Bible reference at the end...? Smh
Firewatch,my 2011 mac :'(
Firewatch,As much as no one will get this reference. This game just gives me straight up Agalloch and Wolves In The Throne Room vibes.
Firewatch,"Mass effect 3, Dragon age 3, and Fallout 4 and Firewatch. All had the same problem. Games with choices but don't even effect the ending."
Firewatch,"Oh,, the music.... Can't wait to play it again"
Firewatch,Whats the engine
Firewatch,The game up to the ending is a 8/10. The ending is a 0/10 because it completely ruins the story built up throughout the game.
Firewatch,"The beginning of this game inspired me to create a game, that is focusing on important life choices, and the inner dialogue that happens in all of us. Check out the demo: @t"
Firewatch,It's a game? I thought it was just some *wallpaper* (thanks IGN)
Firewatch,Anyone notice that this video has 666k views
Firewatch,SHOUTOUT TO NewFortniteYT
Firewatch,is it free?
Firewatch,Those accelerated adverbs of this review are misplaced. This walking simulator has atmospheric graphics and a casual story tot tell. I enjoyed the 4 hours gameplay yet it doesn't justify a full price tag nor is it a highlight in my gaming career. If the reviewer goes in overdrive mode for this game it makes one wonder what grades a game like SOMA would get then.
Firewatch,Bring this for IOS or android
Firewatch,"Jus finished this game in one playthrrough without watching any  videos before playing it. Great game!!! Delilah reminded me of  Samantha from ""Her"" for some reason.... Good game! Highly recommend."
Firewatch,Love it. Great storytelling. Immersive. Beautiful.
Firewatch,Does anyone else have e a problem with navigation? It seems as though you are walking through  a bunch of mud the entire time and you rubber band all of the time.
Firewatch,The journey is a hell of a lot better than the destination for this game. The ending was a bit disappointing.
Firewatch,Come to Switch!!
Firewatch,This game just got to me the characters are so believable
Firewatch,Who said I buy my games?
Firewatch,it's not really a game.
Firewatch,When I clicked this I didn't look at the age I'm just interested in the game and instantly was like whoa this sounds different it's cool to see how far they've come
Firewatch,"Your video def sold me on wanting to play this game , I love all types of games , and especially games that do things differently and I’m fine with just a narrative driven story and the art style seems immersive and appealing to me as well , I will def give this game a try and thanks for convincing me ! Great job 🙌"
Firewatch,Reminds me of the long dark more than anything.
Firewatch,"I think what you meant by ""New Deal Movement"" instead was the national park advertising paintings done in the 30s and 40s."
Firewatch,"Loved this game, tho I think it left something to be wanted, the story was great but I felt the ending lacked, in impact and resolution"
Firewatch,"""felt like Bioshock"" on what kinda stuff r u ?^^"
Firewatch,I finally was able to play it 6yrs from it like I was plan to do. Since it was on gamepass I gave it a try and wow in one setting I forgot about everything from reality and was great I haven’t felt this feeling since I was a teen. Especially the ending was interesting since you chose how the story plays out no clue if there actually a true ending but I was happy with my decision I made.
Firewatch,Screw it ima give it a try🤷🏾‍♂️
Firewatch,K.. sounds like what im looking for going to play it.. ill be back!... with an update haha 😄
Firewatch,buy? steamunlocked
Firewatch,"1) Stop watching this video
2) Play the damn game
3) Come back to this video and up-vote this comment

You're welcome"
Firewatch,Great game. It’s more of an interactive story so if you go into with that mindset it’s hard to be disappointed. $20 is well worth it.
Firewatch,Eeeuuuughhhhhh!!!! I just finished it….it was so so goood such a good story
Firewatch,"Honestly the ending doesn’t quite hit you until after you’ve given it some time to sink in. It will at first feel anti climactic…and then you start thinking about WHY and things start to click into place. 

Of course if they DONT click after you’ve thought about it, I’d recommend a second play through. This game has a LOT of dialogue and some interactions change ENTIRELY based on how you talk to delilah. So its worth a second look regardless. But still! The story is very linear, but the experience can feel a little bit different each time if you’re willing to stop and smell the pines"
Firewatch,"Exactly what i was looking for, nice video"
Firewatch,I actually just started playing it because its on Xbox Game Pass.
Firewatch,Just played this game for the first time 3/29/22. Amazing game that makes me want more. I needed to stop and do other things but I was way too into this game and ended up finishing in one sitting. Wish there were more like it
Firewatch,"It's crazy how appealing ""only 4-5 hrs"" is when you get old haha."
Firewatch,took me 4 hours to hike from beginning to end.
Firewatch,"Only took about 5 hours to play through, I enjoyed it but wouldn’t play it again"
Firewatch,Right when this guy compared this walking simulator to BioShock I had to shut the video off. What. The. Fuck. 🤦‍♂️
Firewatch,this game is beautiful and a peaceful yet not peaceful vibe. such a rare vibe you get.
Firewatch,Playing this game for free in 2022 on game pass. Awesome game
Firewatch,So i just started playing this game for the first time… wow… all I can say is wow
Firewatch,This isn’t a game I’d spend money on.
Firewatch,Just played the game via gamepass. Very fun and highly recommended.
Firewatch,"I absolutely loved this game. I don’t want to spoil anything but the story/gameplay combo is so good. I was able to finish the game in one day (about 5-6hrs). If you looking for a good mystery/adventure game for cheap, then this is definitely worth your money."
Firewatch,This Game fucking Stucks Ass with it’s Shity lovestory
Firewatch,Gamepass!!
Firewatch,"So weird that this reminded you of Bioshock. I don't see that AT ALL, like not even a little bit.  Seems like such an odd comparison to me"
Firewatch,"to late, I aready bought the game infinite times"
Firewatch,Anyone know any similar games?
Firewatch,Absolutely going to buy this. Just wish more games had something other than white guy hands. :(
Firewatch,Its got like a long dark vibe i think?
Firewatch,I want them to make a prequel where you play as Delilah
Firewatch,Is it compatible with keyboard and mouse on console
Firewatch,"I saw Olly Moss in the credits as a 2D artist.. I haven’t done any research yet, but I’m guessing that’s THE Olly Moss??"
Firewatch,I LOVED THE PART WITH THE SPACESHIP!
Firewatch,This game is Never on sale!!! Its 5 years old why! I've always wanted to play but not full price
Firewatch,I just started playing and completed day 1. Love every second of it.
Firewatch,"I recently bought the game, and my god, I love it. Up there with Super Mario Galaxy (my favourite game of all time) for me."
Firewatch,"Knew nothing about this, stumbled upon it. I'm gonna get it. Sounds really interesting."
Firewatch,"Pacing , voice acting , theme , visuals were SO DAMN GOOD . I really loved the game ngl :D"
Firewatch,"The game hit different, great concept, intriguing, different, ominous, love it"
Firewatch,"Had not heard of this game... but now I'm going to download it, thanks!"
Firewatch,I wish I could forget this game....So that I could play it again with that same magic
Firewatch,Anyone else here because it's 5 bucks on steam rn
Firewatch,It’s also real easy to 100%
Firewatch,Not gonna lie when u get hit in the head I pissed myself a little
Firewatch,Just buy the game. It's that good.
Firewatch,Probably gonna but this game soon even though I’ve watched mostly complete play throughs and I still like it cause fire service is what I’m considering. Also by chance is there some sort of an endless mode?
Firewatch,It's boring.
Firewatch,"Played the game on PC but didn't get to finish it, liked it alot so I'm gonna play this on the ps4"
Firewatch,Just finished it. So much fun. Wish there was more games like this.
Firewatch,The frame rate is better on PC and I wish there was more to the story.
Firewatch,do not buy the game u can crack it
Firewatch,"Finally bought it and I can't stop repeating the first 3 days, because in fact there are only 11 and 3(?) are appairently half episodes with just dialogue."
Firewatch,There should be no before you buy for Firewatch! This game is BEAUTIFUL hands down
Firewatch,There is no combat or Bioshock/Doom like shooting? I’m sold.
Firewatch,I didn't hear anything that you were saying because I couldn't stop reading the subtitles.
Firewatch,"Before you buy this, don't. There's barely any gameplay in this. It's like a walking simulator. Just watch a gameplay if you're curious about the story I guess."
Firewatch,Game is good. But ending sucked. Ngl
Firewatch,Offline or online
Firewatch,"Bro I never thought in my hole life a game this good would be based in Wyoming, WYOMING that’s just crazy I love my my state but a amazing game being based in Wyoming makes me proud"
Firewatch,"Fuck this game, the ending was so disappointed, the mysteries hook you and make you wanna know more, just to make them resolve in such a bland way."
Firewatch,Forest brynes
Firewatch,Fucking realistic game. I hated the game's ending.
Firewatch,This game is on sale for $5.99 on the Nintendo eShop right now!!!
Firewatch,"I got it on my switch to help me cope and it's just, absolutely stunning,   im going to get my mom to play it, because she would love it."
Firewatch,"I completed this game in 1 day, its so beatiful, and good voice acts"
Firewatch,There is no before you buy... buy just thr f*cking game
Firewatch,Got this game on the xbox store for 6 bucks no regrets
Firewatch,Fantastic game. I'm in the final 10 minutes of it now. One of the best I've ever played.
Firewatch,"Don't watch the video. Don't question it, Buy The Game."
Firewatch,One of my fav games
Firewatch,So every copy of this game is like $80 to $100 guess I'll never play
Firewatch,I loved this game.
Firewatch,A programmer on the game worked on BioShock 2 apperently
Firewatch,"So do you eat, survive and sleep or is it just discovery and exploration/rpg"
Firewatch,"I finally got around to finishing the game not realizing when I stopped last time I was already on day 79... It is in my top 5 most enjoyable games I've ever played, for sure. If you haven't played it yet, I 100% recommend it to everyone."
Firewatch,"Amazing game, i took it on sale for 6€(?) And you get a free dlc  (audio commentary) ! 
Really immersive, great story, good graphic / unstable frame rate, questionable ending"
Firewatch,"Man, I really hope my refund gets approved."
Firewatch,It's heavily discounted on the PlayStation store at the moment
Firewatch,This was really helpful! Looking forward to playing
Firewatch,"LOOOOL ""worried she hurt your feelings you split a burger""

One week later you are julias boyfriend
 LOOOL"
Firewatch,Okey I’ll buy it
Firewatch,3 years late and it's still an amazing game. Lol I've already played through it 5 times and am liking it more and more. Love ya Campo Santo!
Firewatch,"Bioshock?  What?  I honestly don't understand that comparison.  Unless you mean how you interact with Atlas, I guess that makes sense.  As far as tone goes... I say nay."
Firewatch,They shoul make part 2
Firewatch,"Fun Fact: NO HUMANS (Except you) appear in Firewatch. The creators of the game make you feel as you are all isolated, and only with a walkie talkie, you have to defend yourself.

The music is also scary."
Firewatch,I was running strong 60 on ultra
Firewatch,Watching this 3 years later after finally getting my hands on this game. Such a amazing experience! Thanks Andrew for recommending this!
Firewatch,This game is really good. I recommend it.
Firewatch,"I've just followed thru :-(  I thought it was just a fart, I think my GF is going to leave me"
Firewatch,I already finished the game but I wanted to watch anyway cause I love y’alls vids
Firewatch,They need to make a firewatch 2
Firewatch,I feel like firewatch is one of those games if it ever goes on sale I'll buy
Firewatch,"I got this one 0n sale for 7 bucks. If I had paid 20, I would've been pissed off. Anticlimactic ending."
Blasphemous,What about the music?!
Blasphemous,Not memorable? Sheesh.
Blasphemous,Bro this dude know nothing! This game is a gem
Blasphemous,"No a memorable game!? Im about 3 hours in or so, and it's definitely bloody memorable"
Blasphemous,This game is work of the divel
Blasphemous,This game is focking awesome
Blasphemous,One of the worst level designs I've seen in a while.
Blasphemous,"This guys saying the parry window is way too big and takes away the skill

While also somehow complaining about prayer not casting fast enough (isnt that the whole point lol, trading opening with more damage), beside theres literally bead for faster casting or even gives you i-frames during casting.

But of course the reviewer wouldnt have any idea since there is no way they actually manage to find the bead, that takes way too many skill for them"
Blasphemous,This review is a 2/10
Blasphemous,"Now, 3 years later, we get a sequel. Curious what IGN will give it, as this one was a solid 9.."
Blasphemous,"This is a 10/10 game, you blasphemous."
Blasphemous,"""not memorable"" Blasphemous not memorable, really??? wtf lol"
Blasphemous,IGN is garbage
Blasphemous,'Rely on memorization' like all games where some techniques is required.
Blasphemous,Not a memorable one? The game is quite popular lol
Blasphemous,IGN must be joking.
Blasphemous,This is exactly why IGN has become a joke
Blasphemous,Why does this game remind me of berserk
Blasphemous,"Rated too high. All praise you hear is from the mega fans. Game doesn't compare to it's competition. Interesting art work, other than that it's hot garbage."
Blasphemous,Do yourself a favour and ignore this review. Available for cheap cheap on the eshop for another few days.
Blasphemous,No mention of the awe inspiring story and fantastic OST? This guy is still a top reviewer for the most popular game reviewing channel on the planet?! To crank out half baked first impressions on a game he clearly just sped ran. Embarrassing.
Blasphemous,IGN really butchered this game.
Blasphemous,This is prob one of my fav games
Blasphemous,Forgot to talk about the incredible soundtrack
Blasphemous,this guy is a moron
Blasphemous,"if you're thinking about getting it, do it. It's Castlevania + Dark Souls, just with a dark religious theme based on Spanish folklore. Beautiful"
Blasphemous,"To right your wrongs for this blasphemous critic, you need to do penitence with future silence"
Blasphemous,Bloodborne vibes but 2D imagine this in 3D damn horrifying
Blasphemous,a four minute review for a game like this is outright blasphemy.
Blasphemous,"""A horrendous review, with no relevance to speak of"" Review score: 1/10"
Blasphemous,"This reviewer does realize his job is not to try and point out every subjectively perceived “flaw” right IGN? He’s supposed to be reporting on slow inputs, lag, bugs, not mitigate the efforts of a beautiful project. You’re a very disgraceful lot"
Blasphemous,Bloodstained is an awesome Metroidvania game
Blasphemous,There is no other game like this game tbh it hits different.
Blasphemous,"This game deserves way more than a 7, you give much worse games higher scores"
Blasphemous,"This game is just amazing! If you haven't bought it yet, then go do it. You won't be disappointed."
Blasphemous,Forgot how much of a joke ign is
Blasphemous,"IGN with lazy Pokémon game: “10/10! Best in the series!”

IGN with unique indie game with stunning visuals: “7/10, not memorable, too hard”"
Blasphemous,Best indie game ever
Blasphemous,this game is hard but more often its just tedious and trial and error its not even skill its so annoying this game came out in 2020 and you can't swing the sword while you move like what lol idk this game is dope kinda but its just such a chore to play its not fun traveling to one spot to die then take 5 minutes each time to get back to the spot its really annoying
Blasphemous,"Honestly most people in this comment section are being very biased, this game is a clear 7."
Blasphemous,This game is way better than dar souls and elder ring
Blasphemous,Go from playing Hollow Knight to this and Blasphemous barely becomes a 5/10
Blasphemous,If this was something like a darksouls 2d demake or smth they would have given it a 10
Blasphemous,Ign are boujie
Blasphemous,Mortal kombat
Blasphemous,Not a memorable one?  SMH
Blasphemous,This game is creepy and made by a sick mind. Bosses are insane too.
Blasphemous,IGN opinions don't matter in the slightest they are literally the worst when it comes to anything gaming related
Blasphemous,"IGN fire this dude, his hot take was garbage."
Blasphemous,"You come right back and apologize, IGN. Come back and be ashamed, for what you have done is pure blasphemy."
Blasphemous,Its funny that this dude criticized the game for making the player memorize the enemies attack patterns in a genre where one of their main thing is memorizing attack patterns and level layouts xD
Blasphemous,Oh my gosh! You have to meteorite enemy tells and animations to dispatch them more efficiently as you essentially the combat system! What is this? Some sort of... ACTION game! Say it ain't so!
Blasphemous,You can tell he didn't get far.
Blasphemous,this game was 8 minimum at release. Now  a solid 9. It is second to none in the metroidvania genre right on par with hollow knight. 90%  steam rating.
Blasphemous,IGN is awful
Blasphemous,"Lmao, seeing this video has reminded me once again that game journalists have absolutely no right to review games lmao."
Blasphemous,Kind of looks like Valfaris but with added holy theme to it.
Blasphemous,"7...7?! What's that, the number of brain cells you had whilst grading the game?! This is easily one of the best Metroidvania games out there"
Blasphemous,this is a 9 or 10
Blasphemous,"Ign: gave it a 7
Also ign: put this game one the top 10 metriodvanias"
Blasphemous,Imagine they make this game as non platform game just like Darksouls and elden ring lol maybe in the future
Blasphemous,"Comment 1000, great game."
Blasphemous,Bosses are kinda spammy.  Probably why the game was $6 on the Nintendo store
Blasphemous,This sits comfortably in my Top 10 games of ALL TIME
Blasphemous,Can u guys make it for adroid too just like blood stain
Blasphemous,What game console is this on
Blasphemous,"Backtracking in a metroidvania is like jumping in a Mario game. Yet another inaccurate, unreliable review from IGN. :/"
Blasphemous,Backtracking? You know you're playing a Metroidvania right?
Blasphemous,"Love that they recognize the game as a Metroidvania but then knock the backtracking. Like yeah... that's the genre bro.

Also: the miracles are some of the most powerful attacks in the game and are meant to be used tactically to make difficult encounters slightly easier. The charge is long but can be reduced with items and many of the attacks will one-shot the mobs, and typically from a distance.

This game is easily an 8.5/10 for me, and I've been playing Metroidvanias for the last 20 years."
Blasphemous,It is a really great game. Hopefully there will be more coming.
Blasphemous,This game is better than SoTN. I’d say Hollow Knight is it’s only contender.
Blasphemous,lame review. This game is BADASS.
Blasphemous,"""callous religious imagery,"" ""attacks that keep you stagnant long enough to get hit again,"" learn what words mean, plz"
Blasphemous,I'm not sure this can even be called a metroidvania since there's no real ability gating and you die from falling into pits?
Blasphemous,Soulless bugman reviewer
Blasphemous,The person who reviewed this game is obviously in bed with the Catholic church.
Blasphemous,this game is addicting
Blasphemous,Just ignore everything that this reviews says and go look for another video. IGN reviews = sponsored reviews
Blasphemous,These the guys that gave pokemon sword a 9
Blasphemous,"Your issue was it was too easy? Remember, there's normies that might wanna play this game too 👋"
Blasphemous,LOL @ giving this a 7
Blasphemous,This review is wrong.
Blasphemous,">Says playing on switch
>2:24 What
If anyone want actual decent review go watch nerrel video discussing the game in question. IGN is really garbage."
Blasphemous,This is stephen a smiths favourite video game
Blasphemous,its a 9 hands down
Blasphemous,Ugh wish this was on the vita
Blasphemous,"To this day, with every patch the game keeps getting better and better, plus the free DLC to make a whole experience, IMO this game is a SOLID 9 but in my heart is a 10/10"
Blasphemous,Why the heck is this game 5.4 GB large?
Blasphemous,"Come on, 7?. This game is easily a 10. You didn't even mention the music which is a masterpiece."
Blasphemous,You can see a pattern here in the comments
Blasphemous,So disrespectful to Jesus. And no one should come at me…why do ppl only come at Christianity and no other religion (tht u also DONT believe in). Why not make fun of them. Hollywood makes fun of Christianity….watch and see what happens.
Blasphemous,The Penitent One should be added to Smash Bros
Blasphemous,"Please fire the degens doing reviews over there, since they’ve clearly overwhelmed the department at this point"
Blasphemous,"IGN acts like they never played a souls game before. Most people are still pissed about this review in Steam and for a rightful reason. This game is literally souls like, these qualities are genre defining traits."
Blasphemous,"Blasphemous gets a 7/10
*For twisted are the ways of the grievous miracle...*"
Blasphemous,"This feels pretty nitpicky tbh, like you could’ve just said that the combat is repetitive which isn’t entirely wrong. AND HE GAVE IT A 7, shat on it for hours"
Blasphemous,this review is a great example why people laugh at IGN reviews.
Blasphemous,Buckethead what happened to you???
Blasphemous,this Game has turned out to be a classic one by now. Shame on u IGN.
Blasphemous,what even is this review. just finished it and it was amazing. one of the best games ive played in recent memory.
Blasphemous,"Thanks for bringing this artful game into my life. What a joy. Blastphemous 2, lets fucking go bois."
Blasphemous,Patience is your greatest ally.
Blasphemous,"came here from the blasphemous 2 vid and ended up playing through 1 and got all the dlc and man, what a game. can't wait for 2"
Blasphemous,The sequel has been announced
Blasphemous,Cannot wait for the sequel!! great review!!
Blasphemous,Kindred spirits this blade and I
Blasphemous,Merry 420 everyone. A day to remind the world of peace love and relaxation with family and friends. From the year 2023
Blasphemous,"there´s gonna be a secuel, and it looks AWESOMETACULAR too"
Blasphemous,"This game is only good because of the style and lore. The actual game play imo is garbage. Nothing feels smooth, it forces you to play like a little bitch. Hit boxes feel weird, the dodge timing feels off., parrying doesn’t feel with it. Overall I’d give it like a 4/10."
Blasphemous,"This game is hard? Hollow Knight and Dark Souls say hello.
Though I'll admit Crisanta kicked my ass on my true ending playthrough, which I revelled in."
Blasphemous,"Short but sweet: Carrion.
A 16-bit sidescrolling powertrip gorefest and loveletter to The Thing with quite possibly the smoothest, most elegant controls you've experienced in a long time."
Blasphemous,"The art and concepts of the game are a breath of fresh air. The difficulty level is definitely dark souls and that's OK. but there is a bigger problem here -- there is too little character development in this game! you collect all kinds of items that are tabbed into all types of items, but your abilities and powers grow very little. I have about two dozen of these Quest items and I am very unsure what to do with them. i've been using a walk-through guide and I'm still finding very little use for these quest items. it's a major let down when you beat a boss character only to be rewarded with... another quest item that has no use. there are rosary bead perks and some other equipable powers but they just don't help you very much overall."
Blasphemous,People really watch an entire video game review where its 95% just this guys fricken face. Like what kind of a video is this? This guy must really love himself. Trash
Blasphemous,Jermeys gotta play dark souls/elden ring
Blasphemous,A review I can trust
Blasphemous,"Played it last month and omfg I'm in love, got all the endings, played all the FREE DLC, now I feel empty until the sequel hits next year. 💜
Hell yes to the Blood Omen comparison."
Blasphemous,"I beat all the bosses without healing, it was painful especially on NG+2"
Blasphemous,That's vague review! the majority of the video is a stupid guy talking obvious things about the game! the worst is if this guy is going to read my comment is going to tell why I am wrong and that would be a week argument.
Blasphemous,"I'm not sure i can put in the effort on this one... but ill give it a try. I downloaded it before I watched this review, and it looks awesome, but I'm a little worried about the challenge level. I also think it might be too creepy... the hero martyr guy is creepy, that helmet messes with me!"
Blasphemous,WTF is up with the ladders FUCK
Blasphemous,Lol he calls PC a console
Blasphemous,GOG Just tweeted about this game being on sale so I wanted to see a review for it to go along with the user reviews and I am glad I seen this video! Just subscribed and purchased the game!
Blasphemous,This is my favorite game of all time.
Blasphemous,Good call on blood omen. This definitely has that kind of vibe. I love it and we need more stuff like this!
Blasphemous,"This guy: 6:11


Gellot: Are you challenging me?"
Blasphemous,"Got the kill all bosses without healing trophy and holy fuck, I’ve never been so proud of getting a trophy before in my life. Do it if your still playing"
Blasphemous,"Was on the fence about getting this game, glad you did a review my dude. As soon as you compared it to the first time you played Legacy of Kain, I was sold lol. That is a series I adore and would go back and play with all the wonky ass controls and shit graphics again lol"
Blasphemous,Lmfao! 🤣 I wonder how you'd like Ender Lilies: Quietus of Knights or Hollow Knight maybe the Ori games Ori and the Blind Forest and/or Ori and the Will of the Wisps
Blasphemous,u shud show gameplay when talking about the game
Blasphemous,"My favorite crushingly challenging game is probably Dark Souls. The first game just has this certain mood to it. No matter where you are, you feel so alone, even if there's other NPCs in the game. And it has really interesting lore. You pick up an item and it has a description that feeds you more information about the world. However, it is quite challenging, which makes me want to stop playing at times. But sooner or later, I find myself back in trying to uncover the game's secrets"
Blasphemous,Yesterday I finally started this game. I agree with this entire video 💯💯
Blasphemous,"Came to this video because they just announced the sequel, looks like they heard you Jeremy!"
Blasphemous,"Unpopular opinion: Hollow Knight is not the ""best"" metroidvania game."
Blasphemous,"I just brought Blasphemous today, I like  it so far. Hearing it's awesometactular (not sure I spelled that right) confirms that I made the right choice buying the game."
Blasphemous,Yeah!
Blasphemous,I played Blasphemous after playing the original Metroid. At least Blasphemous has a map!
Blasphemous,I liked and subscribed as soon as I heard the pun
Blasphemous,I hope when SIlksong comes out that Jeremy reviews it. So that means he might have long hair again when he reviews that.
Blasphemous,Why is this game so expensive???
Blasphemous,The last faith looks hype
Blasphemous,"filling your helmet with blood then wearing it, i m game"
Blasphemous,Over half way through my very first SOTN  playthrough and really enjoying it. got Bloodstained ROTN next. @jeremy have you played Bloodstained? review coming maybe if so??
Blasphemous,I wonder if he's played the nightmarish dlcs...
Blasphemous,How about another review of Blasphemous? it got 2 huge updates so... many things changed for the better
Blasphemous,"With C=64 games, we used to use graph paper to jot down pixel perfect maps."
Blasphemous,We need Jeremy to review Bloodborne.
Blasphemous,"Jeremy there's a Bloodstained x Blasphemous DLC for this game, let's get to it!"
Blasphemous,Yoo  jeremy have you tried the free updates they are pretty good
Blasphemous,This dude is my absolute favorite. I watched him for movie reviews. And now he is reviewing a game that I was interested in? Are you kidding me? And he likes it too! I'm sold. Jeremy jahns you're freaking Rock.
Blasphemous,Just started this. I needed a new fix after beating the other game I’d recommend-Metroid AM2R. It’s a fan made game but don’t let that put you off. It’s one of the greats.
Blasphemous,"Have you checked out the DLC yet? If not, I’m gonna say you definitely want to 100% your file before doing so, and for the penitences, your range attack will be your best friend, especially if you keep in mind that spell damage is the modifier for the ranged attack, not your sword modifier. I’m off on my third penitence  now, wish me luck on that whole “no healing flasks” part."
Blasphemous,Hey do a review of the stir of dawn DLC update
Blasphemous,More videogame reviews!!
Blasphemous,You should check out Salt and Sanctuary. Same sort of soul crushingly hard metroidvania with but loads of lore and style.
Blasphemous,"I'm just now starting this on PS5 while waiting for newer games. I have a love for Metroidvania games, I am absolutely loving this art/gameplay/lore, all of it. You really hit the nail on describing the relationship between the player and taking a dick shot from a new enemy lmao. Set aside from Castlevania game series, Hollow Knight is my newest favorite Metroidvania game, it is so beautiful along with the OST. The lore and theories on that.... Can't wait for the sequel!!!"
Blasphemous,I can't believe you brought up legacy of kain... I forgot all about that damn masterpiece
Blasphemous,"Agreed 1000% about the giant baby, I think that's the part that stuck with me the most when I first watched the trailer before it came out."
Blasphemous,😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠😠 This Is A Blasphemy Agianst Jesus Christ... The Bible Says If Anyone Blasphemy Agianst The Son Theres Forgiven But If Anyone Blasphemy Agianst The Holy Spirit Theres No Forgiven
Blasphemous,"If you love these vibes, read Berserk."
Blasphemous,"I just picked this up, had no idea Jeremy reviewed this. IM HOOKED"
Blasphemous,"Best Metroidvania games are probably still Super Metroid and Hollow Knight. Zero Mission is also mad underrated and has some of the best/most organic level design and smoothest mechanics I've ever seen in a game, but the difficulty is not particularly challenging.

Really looking forward to playing Blasphemous though, the game looks great"
Blasphemous,"Ah, my man Jeremy. 
I can always trust your reviews. If you gave a score like this to a game, I’d be a fool to not bench my initial concerns or pessimism. I think I’ll make the purchase after all. (Was concerned given the initial reception but after all the patches and free dlc, and this review, I think I’ll give it a go)"
Blasphemous,It's $10 on psn right now until 10/15 I think. I'm downloading it now hope it's great I trust Jeremy's reviews and I love metroidvania type games plus this is cheaper than a 6 pack!!
Blasphemous,i would totally watch a jeremy jahns lets play
Blasphemous,"The aesthetic reminds me more of Demons crest from the SNES. If you haven’t heard of Demons Crest, then you must play it if you are a fan of castlevania and mega man."
Blasphemous,Yeah I get the blood omen vibes. Very dark world
Blasphemous,Currently playing it and loving every crushing moment.
Blasphemous,Play hollow knight too
Blasphemous,They fixed the map in the free dlc.
Blasphemous,When are we getting a Cuphead review?
Blasphemous,"Blasphemous is definitely on my wish list. Especially since there is dlc coming. Gotta wrap up Hollow Knight first. Another great MetroidVania game, similar to Ori"
Blasphemous,No alcohol is required
Blasphemous,"La-Mulana 1 & 2 are the biggest, bestest, and most challenging Metroidvanias in existence."
Blasphemous,Shame this game doesnt have a spell that makes your attacks like the crissaegrim (chris-aye-grim) for a brief moment.
Blasphemous,The theme reminds me of Binding of Isaac.
Blasphemous,"Watch this video to see exactly how bad youtube stacks their liked videos. 13k likes, sure , guy"
Blasphemous,"no matter the game , movie, still make me laugh. love you man"
Blasphemous,"Also, consider playing the following Metroidvania and Soulslike:
- Iconoclasts
- Salt & Sanctuary
- Death's Gambit
- Owlboy
- Dark Devotion
- Mortal Shell
- Hollow Knight"
Blasphemous,I saw you for the first time and it was the last one. To many cuts and not funny jokes. I couldn't watch it constantly for more than 10 seconds. Thumb down.
Blasphemous,The dlc is better looking in some areas.. I want a secuel as well
Blasphemous,I just beat the game today for the first time. I loved it and this review.
Blasphemous,Def consider giving Hollow Knight a go! Similar gameplay and difficulty as Blasphemous with a captivating art style and score.
Blasphemous,"The free DLC is coming out on August 4th!
Also, another game I'd recommend is Hyper Light Drifter."
Blasphemous,For a sprite based game. Game kitchen made a very disturbing and creepy. i hope they could expand this universe even more and give us bigger game after blasphemous!!!!
Blasphemous,Jj there is going to be a new game plus in August
Blasphemous,Free DLC came out and it’s everything you asked for and more
Blasphemous,You wanna have a difficult time play horizon zero dawn on ultra hard that’s some bullshit lmfaooo
Blasphemous,Has Jeremy ever played the fromsoft games.
Blasphemous,You really went downhill content-wise huh
Blasphemous,This was the review that convinced me to buy it. I haven't been this addicted to a game in a long time. I can't get enough of it.
Blasphemous,Bring up the Kain series......instant subscribe.
Blasphemous,Dark Devotion is another great game if you like Blasphemous.
Blasphemous,"Jeremy, pleaaaassseee try hollow knight, I played through the entire game recently and it's one of my favorites of all time at this point, most games dont come close to hollow knights world building, lore, exploration, atmosphere, and boss fights, even the fighting is engaging even if it's simple"
Blasphemous,Please review Bloodborne. I just want you to experience it's glory and gush
Blasphemous,A game i didn't hear about I'm not into dark souls esc games besides Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order do you think I should try it out I never played castlevania either would it be right for me
Blasphemous,Just picked it up on switch for $12 digging it so far but I can tell the difficulty is gonna ramp up lol damn souls like games!!!
Blasphemous,"Pick your zone, stick your zone, discover your zone!"
Blasphemous,"Dodge, Duck, Dip, Slash, and Dodge."
Blasphemous,Im still annoyed blasphemous isnt available in New Zealand
Blasphemous,So it's a metroidsoulsvania game.
Super Hexagon,"Super Hexagon is one of those genre defining masterpieces
I hope your video blows up like it deserves"
Super Hexagon,why you are 81 subs only damn !!!??
Super Hexagon,"Are we just gonna ignore the fact that he TOOK HIS FLIPPING PANTS OF, SAT DOWN IN HIS CHAIR HALF NAKED, AND RAGED OVER A FLIPPIN' 2.5D GAME WITH A HEXAGON AND A TRIAGNLE?!?!"
Super Hexagon,I am glad I have the reflexes of a ninja mixed with a cat cross-bred with a robot-ninja-cat
Super Hexagon,Here in 2023 wishing there was a part 2 😂
Super Hexagon,"2023 fun fact: the music is STILL pretty good in Hexagon level, even though it's a HARDEST game."
Super Hexagon,1375 vid watched - If you add some music beat to somehow match movement that would be awsome game
Super Hexagon,"Dude, play the 3DS version, it’s way better"
Super Hexagon,Seizure warning! There isn't much flashing lights in this but if you are an epileptic like me then just be warned if you have photosensitive epilepsy.
Super Hexagon,currently obssesed with this game so i decided to come back and watch mark die over this
Super Hexagon,7:34 LMAO
Super Hexagon,"Oh boi~ I'm such a devil~ uhuhu~ 😈❤️

I recently passed the scratch game of super hexagon. In hexagoner in hyper mode. I'm very good in that game actually. But it took me a lot of time to get past though to hexagonest hyper mode. It gave me 60 seconds to pass point, line, triangle, square, pentagon and hexagon stage. Mastering it isn't easy, some people said that this game is spinning their brains are spinning. I have a tough mind to focus the walls and get through them like a master hexagon. Whoa... What a tough level... Hardestest... ._."
Super Hexagon,"Beat the game in 2-3 years, trust me I went thgough the same suffering g as playing the last final level level 6
Edit: it gets hard at ghe dnd bug that a vood sn I v once got beat fit"
Super Hexagon,1376 videos down
Super Hexagon,how does he get 22 seconds first try bruh i get like 7 seconds 50th try
Super Hexagon,Imagine being here in 2022
Super Hexagon,My eyes stop comprehending what I'm seeing quite a bit sooner than when Mark dies.
Super Hexagon,"14:32
Aw You Almost Beat The Level"
Super Hexagon,"10:40 Huh, didn't know Mark was an og JonTron viewer. Cool!"
Super Hexagon,Ragey
Super Hexagon,Imagine him playing hyper hexagonest as the first level
Super Hexagon,Why hello there travelers. Still watching old school Markimu?
Super Hexagon,What the hell I had no idea he played this game
Super Hexagon,69 seconds is my record
Super Hexagon,REAL GAMER HOWWW
Super Hexagon,Hey Markiplier You should try zero ranger that game is so damn hard not to mention a level at the end of the true ending in which if you die once the game restarts the first half is easy but the second half of the game is almost to hard to beat (took me 2 years to beat mostly because i gave up for a really long time)
Super Hexagon,surprised he didn't try arcade mode hyper hexagonest. that thing is nuts. makes the hard mode look easy.
Super Hexagon,"Little did he realize... Pogostuck, Getting over it..."
Super Hexagon,woah woah woah did i just enter a time machine
Super Hexagon,i have completed this game 100 times
Super Hexagon,You should give this another shot.
Super Hexagon,Last comment 1month ago wth
Super Hexagon,hello from the future it’s kind of a mess here
Super Hexagon,Man that would be a bad time to find out you have epilepsy
Super Hexagon,"7 years ago

Super Hexagon,When you play so much super hexagon you start hearing gay revolver instead of game over 😂
Super Hexagon,if only he knew
Super Hexagon,Super hexagon is a very confusing game. 😂
Super Hexagon,"wow, this game is 7 years old now. thats insane...."
Super Hexagon,If he keeps making excuses he'll never improve
Super Hexagon,Did I just die?
Super Hexagon,Laughs in pogostuck
Super Hexagon,Wasn't that inspired by Polybius?
Super Hexagon,"Honestly, 22 seconds on Mark's first try? That is awesome, but it's a little suspicious that there wasn't a tutorial for the first time. Either way, that's pretty good.

Now, who's working towards Hyper Hexagonest? 👍"
Super Hexagon,"markiplier: OMG OMG.... AHHH!
me: bruh i play it and basically its not that hard"
Super Hexagon,Who's watching in 2020 like if you watch lol
Super Hexagon,I HATE THIS GAME!!!!
Super Hexagon,"I completed all stages and it was pretty hard. 
Edit: Btw my first try was 5 secs"
Super Hexagon,"Mark: ‘You guys suggested when I asked you on Facebook’

Me: Holy fuck this is old"
Super Hexagon,Who else came here because of Chipzel?
Super Hexagon,"markiplier: THE HARDEST GAME EVER MADE!
Geometry dash: i'll show you what's hard"
Super Hexagon,im 2020
Super Hexagon,"Bruh it's not the game its YOU YOUR A NOOB!!! THATS WHY I COMPLETED HEXAGONER LINE SO EASE




BUT THE HYPER STAGES AND HEXAGONEST ARE HARDESTESTESTESTER"
Super Hexagon,"I dunno why, but I could see the music in this being remade on the Composer Island in My Singing Monsters. That is, if it can even be possible."
Super Hexagon,This is normal
Super Hexagon,Who's here in 2020! Like if you are!
Super Hexagon,apparently he cant stay calm.
Super Hexagon,All i know that the good cop bad cop script used the theme of the game
Super Hexagon,Sometimes I think that this is a fucking raging game
Super Hexagon,13:20
Super Hexagon,lol xd
Super Hexagon,Game Over.
Super Hexagon,"You should give this game another shot. Last time you went into total Zen Mode, 20/20/20/20 happened."
Super Hexagon,"This video kinda reminds me of dantdm to the scene, ""my brain is... """
Super Hexagon,"Hexagon: this is easy
Hexagoner: wait super hexagon isn’t easy
Hexagonest: holy shit my fingers"
Super Hexagon,"Markiplier relax, Just get the Hexagon, & something good will happen, Even if the <| Died after a min."
Super Hexagon,I DUNNO WHO DIS IS
Super Hexagon,I have gotten to hyper firat level and second
Super Hexagon,I can pass that level
Super Hexagon,"Mark: *complains about hexagon*




Hyper hexagonist: *I'm about to end this man's whole career*"
Super Hexagon,I'm honestly impressed that Mark went for 20 seconds on his first try.
Super Hexagon,Markiplier 2013 you feel like an epileptic squid on LSD also known as psychedelic magic acid
Super Hexagon,A psychedelic game like a triangle on LSD-acid
Super Hexagon,A can of LSD what???
Super Hexagon,Super hexagon is so confusing cause you have to move the triangle in the lines of the game.
Super Hexagon,Best video in 2019 ever! 😇
Super Hexagon,"""MotHer oF hUmp!""



Also you should play just shapes and beats, its similar to this in the way that its a rythm based game, but it has a story mode and its amazing! It has incredible music, and its very visualy appealing even though the art style is simplistic and the levels have an end to them."
Super Hexagon,i am 100 seconds on tat level
Super Hexagon,"(Markiplier) the hardest game




(Open Hexegon) HOLD MY DEVIANCE LEVEL..."
Super Hexagon,im just 8 years old and l all ready complete the game 😪
Super Hexagon,I remember the first time I played this game. It was like SUPER HARD to get to 10 seconds. I was so happy when I got 10 seconds. Now I got 79:44 Seconds

Super Hexagon,*2019?*
Super Hexagon,"You did brilliantly for someone who just picked up this game. 59 seconds after less than 15 minutes of playing - that's awesome! It took me hours until I mastered it!

I think this is one of those classic and eternal skillful games which will never get old. Sure, its application is very niche, but it sure is impressive showing off one's skills in Hardestestest - a neat party trick!

Also hello. Never commented on your vids, but I've been lurking. All the best"
Super Hexagon,"HE GOT 22s FIRST TRY?!
Me: 3s"
Super Hexagon,`hey mark if you ever play this again remember this use a mouse not a game pad there is more room for error with a mouse the best mouse i would recommend for it just because of the switches are light is Redragon M608 but thats just me
Super Hexagon,I wanted to see marks first vid ind it took me 5 minutes XD

Super Hexagon,EASY GAME
Super Hexagon,Hello from 2019 :) lmao I remember when this video was new.
Super Hexagon,it took you 15 minutes to pretty much beat hard? AND you're talking at the same time? man ur really good at this game
Super Hexagon,Took me some time
Super Hexagon,Hardest game ever in world
Super Hexagon,"Just came across this... wow, I love watching this game. It's like the old screensavers from the 90s, but with a little more acid thrown in."
Super Hexagon,2019??
Super Hexagon,1 SECOND FRON BEATING IT
Super Hexagon,"I've beaten Hexagon, lasted for a minute in Hyper, then went to Bonus.
I've also beaten Hexagoner, but haven't defeated Hyper.

But OVERSHOOTS IN HEXAGONEST"
Super Hexagon,I got 40 seconds on Hyper Hexagonest even though I am 13
Starbound,First comment in over a year 🍆
Starbound,Terraria otherworld
Starbound,People not realizing that the main dev was a former terraria sprite artist:
Starbound,This is basically terraria but you start in the space
Starbound,better terraria
Starbound,This game is so worth it
Starbound,Looks unpolished ripoff terraria
Starbound,"I'm still playing in 2021, anyone else??"
Starbound,guys. stop it.
Starbound,Space terraria lol
Starbound,Rtx terraria
Starbound,terraria knock off
Starbound,Looks like a straight terraria clone. Couldn’t they have done something to at least make it play/look a little different 🤔
Starbound,He doesn't even talk about how you can build your own colony like in Minecraft and build your own space colony ect
Starbound,Looks like terraria
Starbound,I wish they kept updating starbound.
Starbound,This is a ripoff of Terraria
Starbound,"I'd like to know, is it different from Terraria?"
Starbound,"Starbound is almost look like terraria,im not saying if its rippoff or spinoff"
Starbound,You can also catch the monsters like Pokemon
Starbound,starbound is the #1 most underrated game of our time
Starbound,"started playing terraria about a month ago. first playthrough, large map, master mode. I am currently at 250 hours and I've only beaten the destroyer in hardmode. i need a break and i think this game is might be that break for me."
Starbound,And how about the ps vita version?
Starbound,Spoiler warning!
Starbound,Basically Terraria mixed with no mans land
Starbound,UHHH I WISH THIS WAS ON PS4
Starbound,terraria better
Starbound,Sad that this game died :/
Starbound,"I saw the thumbnail and acctualy thought it was terraria, *terraria is better than this starbound game*"
Starbound,9.1 it has a little something for everyone
Starbound,"Thank you for spelling out very well what I would enjoy (the story and building) and what I would hate (trying, over and over, for the precise movements needed to get past a boss, and losing all my stuff when I die).  I'll be happy to watch someone else play, who's mastered the game."
Starbound,How did this get a better score then terraria
Starbound,"Why is everyone comparing no man sky with starbound? ""don't play NMS play this"" they are completely different games that happen to space themed. its like saying guys don't play Mario kart if you want to race play Forza horizon. Completely different types of games."
Starbound,Never heard of this game until Ross of game grumps tweeted he liked it more than terraria. Now I’m def gonna have to try this
Starbound,Ok...I'ma give this a shot...but it's my last dollaz you better be right about this
Starbound,"Still waiting for it to show on PS4.
Not holding my breath. Still hopeful!
However, til I hear something, letting this fall off my radar. 😞"
Starbound,Casual
Starbound,Why this appear when i search Terraria
Starbound,Starbound: a game that shoots for the stars and lands in cow manure
Starbound,Terrarias better
Starbound,Awesome video
Starbound,Can't believe I never heard of this. Seems like my kind of game.
Starbound,Starbound or Stardew Valley? idk if i want to do both
Starbound,Is this a sandbox game or an rpg?
Starbound,hey is this offline multiplayer?
Starbound,Better than Terraria
Starbound,"Song in the background is Galactic Magnetic by Eddy Pradelles you wont find the song on youtube.
These videos really need to start sourcing all there music."
Starbound,I want to get this game for soda and because it looks interesting.
Starbound,But can you drink soda?
Starbound,but like Terraria is better
Starbound,Does anyone know the name of the song used in this video ??
Starbound,This dude's voice and ign's/his video model of getting right into it then having a 2 second intro screen deserve an emmy. Thank you. Subscribed.
Starbound,So this is like a 2d Minecraft?
Starbound,I rate it a 7.8
Starbound,I really need this game on the switch
Starbound,Chicklefish is a gem
Starbound,Terraria’s better
Starbound,"Terrabound

Steraria"
Starbound,"typical ign
""this game is hard"""
Starbound,This is such a Terraria ripoff 😡
Starbound,Too many caves. 2.5/10 -IGN
Starbound,No starbound for PS4
Starbound,"""Diverse enemies and fighting styles""
Fighting styles:
- Charges at you full speed
- Charges at you full speed
- Charges at you full speed but with a sword or hammer
- Charges at you full speed
- Shoots with gun

Lets be honest, guys. Bosses are the only ones with diverse fighting techniques, and even their patterns repeat with slight changes. I love this game, but the combat system isn't it's best side..."
Starbound,Terraria got a 9.0 on IGN. This got a 9.1.
Starbound,Honestly I like Terraria better.
Starbound,"Can you morons stop with the Terraria vs Starbound?
They are made by the same creators








Do something much more smarter like:
Starbound vs Minecraft.
I'd like to see minecraft getting roasted"
Starbound,Yay! 9.1 on my favorite game! We need to get more people playing this...
Starbound,"PLAY STARBOUND AT STEAM.COM FOR $14.99. ONWARD, PROTECTORATE!"
Starbound,terraria 2
Starbound,So Terraria has magic and Starbound has science
Starbound,Times everything he said by 3x when you include atleast 50+ of the largest mods out there.
Starbound,it's really beautiful game but for me terraria will be still best 2d game ever
Starbound,"Guys, StarBound and Terraria are no alike. They are both the great."
Starbound,Mods just make the game much better
Starbound,"If you opted into casual mode, it disables item drop on death. Item drop on death in this game is very unnecessary and meant for only for those who want to sink in a tremendous amount of hours into this game."
Starbound,Anyone knows the song from the background music here? :'( I really like it!!
Starbound,Is this song on the soundtrack? Can't seem to find it!!
Starbound,I played this game years ago and just had a blast exploring. I think I should get back into this because I'm sure a lot of things have changed.
Starbound,"IGN, if Starbound is really a 9.1, I hope you rated Terraria a straight 10."
Starbound,"been playing this since nobody ever heard of it and everyone was super hype about no man's sky and I was like ""I already have starbound, why would I want no man's sky"""
Starbound,I'll buy when it's out on the switch
Starbound,"I was on the fence about this until I heard sentient robots stuck in a humorously medieval mindset.

Thanks to Chippy Gaming's play-through and IGN for helping me make up my mind.  Cheers!"
Starbound,"I love this game, but you didn't really highlight a lot of its main faults, even now almost 2 years later. The combat is fairly stale if you go melee, the bosses, though scripted, are far less engaging than Terraria, there are only 3 builds to ""experiment"" with. These are  minor issues in the grand scheme of things, as it really does most everything else almost perfectly, and the frackin universe mod really fixes a lot of my issues I had.

However, no matter how good  your PC is, even after beta, it has performance issues. The promised secure multiplayer servers never happened, so having a large world with large groups is impossible without disallowing mods. These are fairly large issues that is what I think prevented this game from gaining traction and surpassing Terraria in popularity."
Starbound,the main menu music is so... mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Starbound,"It's 2018 and starbound is getting better and expanding by the day, if you still haven't checked it out now's a good time!"
Starbound,Anyone here from PBG Hardcore because they didn't know what it is lol
Starbound,Anyone here from PBG Hardcore because they didn't know what it is lol
Starbound,Why can’t people say that both star bound and terraria are amazing games.
Starbound,"Firtst of all, the music is the best music, that's not a suggestion.  Second of all don't play survival mode, play casual, because survival ruins the game."
Starbound,"I love thia game, it's so beautifull, it has a great story and it gave me a unique experiance. People say it's a game that copied terraria, but it's completly original...      If you can, play it."
Starbound,"Yeah I don't know why they made survival mode the default, either. I almost never play it."
Starbound,"This, is how you make open world games a story"
Starbound,"801 hours in starbound!







i have no life"
Starbound,Looks like a terraria ripoff
Starbound,The mods are a big plus to talk about
Starbound,When is it going to be on xbox tho
Starbound,God damn game ripoffs
Starbound,"Wow, Zelda, Megaman and Minecraft comparisons..."
Starbound,Sounds like terraria..
Starbound,a copy of terraria XD
Starbound,You should play it now while you wait for Starfield
Starbound,"Judging based on ""an hour of enjoyment for every $1 spent"" is something I've heard on occasion, but have never agreed with. What about an amazing, short experience? That'd fail by this metric."
Starbound,terraria copy
Starbound,it is a fun game worth to check out if you can get it on sale.
Starbound,solid review!
Starbound,"Bought this game when it was early access years ago, just got a steam deck. Had a blast with some friends might be time to go back."
Starbound,What consoles is this on? I only see this on pc!
Starbound,"I really enjoy this game , but for your sanity , disable droping inventory upon death , you die a lot in this game , not from monster , but from yourself"
Starbound,Its free...
Starbound,Space Terraria
Starbound,Hey i forgot what is this is it a star empire terraria?
Starbound,With over 2 000 hours in this game I say NO! The game is really bland without hundreds of mods and the mods themselves are all very bland too and just add whats already been added by a billion other mods.
Starbound,"The devs abandoned the game and moved onto other games, which ended up being mediocre, or negatively reviewed. They should have stuck with starbound to make it more optimized and enjoyable."
Starbound,"I absolutely loved this game when it was first released, even though things went a bit south development wise at the end there I should go back to play this game again. To mess around and get some nostalgia as well as get some mods to play with :)."
Starbound,It really is just terraria but possibly better
Starbound,"Clear and concise. Been looking for something to satisfy the Terraria sweet tooth as of late. I tried this back in 2017 but quit because there was no way to PAUSE the game!! Also, the lack of automap when underground was a big disappointment. But I'm gonna give Starbound another shot now that they DID fix the single player pause, apparently. Another biggish complaint is that the game has had zero updates since 2019 and seems to be abandoned, or perhaps finished? Thanks again for a great review!"
Starbound,How do you get this game to play so smoothly every time I play I get stuttering the hud is clipping into each other and slow down wen in village or enemies on screen and delay button input I want to like this game but it’s pushing me away 😩
Starbound,"Could somebody explain why so many people say that the developers killed Starbound? I just don´t get it and its making me kind of sad. I think Starbound is even better than Terraria but thats just my opinion. Theres just so much stuff you can do and pretty much everything is fun. I played is for nearly 400 hours now and there still is so much to do. I love the graphics, the story and the creatures. Best game for me"
Starbound,"i bought this back in 2014 and its still one of my top 10 games. i always go back every year. but i still wish they had the old mob sounds rather than just the generic ""boop"" for everything"
Starbound,"I love this game. I finished the main storyline and continue to play it. I've been playing it for years and am still really enjoying myself. This game is like a pixel version of No Man's Sky with more fun features. One of my favorite aspects of the game is the building.

Alongside progressing through the main storyline I made it a point to first hunt down a planet that I really liked the biome and aesthetics of. I did this all for the purpose of claiming it as my own. Then I proceeded to build on it. Building requires resources so my casual gaming entails me jumping from one planet to another to gather resources I need to renovate, build, and expand my base which I've built on my claimed planet. One of the things I'm most proud of that I built is an underground tunnel that runs the entire length of my planet. I keep hover bikes down there as well so I can just zoom through. The long term plan is use the tunnel/hi-way to connect it to other buildings I put up.

I guess you could say I play this game like Minecraft or Lego wherein I'm continuously building. There are still so many things I want to build and implement on my planet. To name a few; a functioning farm, underground storage warehouse, underground armory, museum, and maybe a library.

I think it's also worth mentioning that I still play this game in its stock vanilla form (no mods)."
Starbound,"I would very much recommend starbound very beautiful and chill game, I personally like survivor mode I’ve played casual for a thousand hours or less on my dads pc but k is I’m starting my own adventures on my pc, it’s very peaceful and is really fun i do wish they added more stuff like new features or legendary stuff and i overall love the game the music is a 10/10 if you like piano, I’ve been introducing my friend to it and he likes it. And it has a very very very variety of stuff"
Starbound,"I'm a huge fan of Terraria, and even though I never had anyone to play with, I played it twice from start to ""finish""; I bought Starbound expecting it to be just like Terraria, but with more content, oh boii, how wrong I was...

To be honest I think I am at fault; I play alone, I didn't even search about the game other than ""oh, nice, another game from Terraria's creators"" and I played so little of it to make sense of what I've seen; that being said, I f-ing hate this game.... While Terraria feels like an exploration game where you have the whole world at your dispose to be explored, Starbound feels so overwhelming and tiny. I know it has so much to offer, but it feels like devs. threw everything they got at you in the first couple minutes of the game, so I feel anxious about everything.

Anyways, maybe someday I'll play it, I'd love to, and your video made me a bit hopeful about it, but in the meantime, I still hate it hahaha."
Starbound,"The game can be really fun or really annoying to begin with, just depends on if you get a gun or not on your first planet."
Starbound,you forgot to mention that you can settle up on a planet you like and build base with a farms and homes for npc that join you and give you quests and stuff..
Starbound,"For those that have Game Pass for PC, it's on there too"
Starbound,Terraria meet stardew valley
Starbound,"As huge veteran that saw the pile of debates that happened around it, I'll say that the modding community took the games their own.

there is a truckload of content made by fans, although I advised to stay away from niche communities, espescially in discord.

it's a fun experience that can last forever if you love exploration and building, but you have to know what you're in for"
Starbound,Terraria is miles better than Starbound. (Obviously these 2 games are different in their own way) but if you're into RP Starbound is the way to go
Starbound,Just buy Terraria.
Starbound,Why no CC?
Starbound,"Starbound has been one of my favorite games growing up. I’d always play it in my free time. It’s new updates got the best of me like the mechs, or the bounty hunter update. If only I could play this game with friends."
Starbound,"Been playing it a lot for the last 3 weeks, around 60 hours in a bit more than 3 weeks, I love this game. Overall with my older characters I have almost 100 hours on Steam and I really love this game. Starbound is one of my favorite game simply because it’s fun and has plenty of things to do and I haven’t even finished the main quest or started building a colony or tweaking my ship, nor a space station and many more... And I haven’t even started modding the game yet, I’m happy because I know still have dozens of hours to come on this game."
Starbound,"You should only buy it if you time travel back to 2017. The game is dead, and there are way better options on the market as of 2022. The modding community hasn’t carried the game enough to warrant a purchase, and the overall gameplay is somewhat poor. My only enjoyment came from building grand bases (And the building system is inferior to other popular games of the same genre like terraria and minecraft). The exploration and survival elements of the game are pretty piss poor. The only semi exciting thing to find is a dungeon, which is usually just a hallway filled with traps and then a treasure room. No replayability factor as the bad story stays the same, along with everything else, or thousands of unique items to collect like terraria has. 

TDLR; Skip it. Better options on the market and the game is dead."
Starbound,"If you ingore the story and play with mods, then yes it's worth it sadly the story was a bust."
Starbound,It's not for consoles yet
Starbound,"I love starbound I have 1,082 hours on it."
Starbound,yes you should
Starbound,since when has it been on consoles?
Starbound,"Just picked this up for the first time, with about a dozen mods, including frackin universe and shell guard. Addicted."
Starbound,"This game is bad compared to Terraria. In Terraria you have to beat the bosses to progress further in the game. You do the same in Starbound. How ever, in Starboud you reach these points in very short intervals, and when you do, its like hitting a wall in full flight!
In Terraria it takes much longer, and it feels very soft so to speak. You can do so much stuff before you come to the point where you notice, i guess i need higher tier material now... While in Starbound you suddenly can't do $hit anymore. And the fcking game balance is tied to that, and is completely broken on top of it.
The boss fights aren't funny either. They are a chore. Its all about sequence waiting. And combat is bad. Thank god we have a stamina bar, because that improves everything. Who doesn't like to watch a green bar fill up, before you can act agian... on top of all the broken game balance $hit. Like getting one shotted from far outside of the screen.

At the same time in Terraria, i have the choice between several combat styles. Melee, ranged or Magic. And what about the ""robots"" you can drive in Starbound? Sounds fun right? Too bad they are useless.

This is a game about digging. And what can't you do, so very often? You can't dig. Because reasons. A game with so much potential, yet so limited and restricted in literally every aspect this game throws at you. Also the User Interface fcking sucks donkey balls! Who ever designed this crap should be castrated!"
Starbound,This game is boring af
Starbound,"I have 600 hours in this game, for a 15$ pricetag I'd say that's pretty worth it"
Starbound,"I couldnt get used to the floaty controls in this game, it felt downright slippery for a side scrolling game. Also like most I wasnt a fan at  all of the story mode, so I ended up not playing it much. I'm sure it's a great game with mods, vanilla game just was a let down after playing Terraria for so long, my expectations were high after hearing people hype Starbound up as the next Terraria."
Starbound,The story mode always make me stop playing
Starbound,Isn't this just a reskinned terraria?
Starbound,"Brilliant game, still one of my favorites. Atmosphere, music, graphics, gameplay and setting are stellar. The forced tier progression is very much avoidable with mods, and mods in general greatly enhance and expand the game. I always skip the storyline entirely on new playthroughs. It was lots of fun the first time, but obviously gets stale. With some modding you can do whatever you want. Great review.
For the more experienced players, I also recommend trying out hardcore mode!"
Starbound,"Lol NO. 

The developers are scum and the game was abandoned."
Starbound,They should just give the game to a better team. Chucklefish abandoned it and it's a real shame. It's one of the best space-themed games I've ever played.
Starbound,24 hours? Pfft I only have 180 and that doesn’t even seem like a lot
Starbound,No idea tf is this but is it space terraria
Starbound,Anyone got this game working on the Steam Deck yet?
Starbound,"4$ as of now on steam, will be getting it! Looks fun"
Starbound,"It's an ok game, but after the drama from the devs and publisher. (Broken promises, and allegations)

I just can't play the game unmodded, sure get the game it can be fun. But don't get your hopes up, it will get boring real fast. (Lot's of repetition, and unbalanced procedural generation)

I played a lot of sandbox, I like to grind. But Starbound vanilla now is just not great. (And it's my opinion but alpha shows so much potential, but now wasted on a broken mess of a game of starbound)"
Starbound,"I bought this, was planning on buying stardew valley, which was part of the chucklefish and friends pack, I bought everything for like 95% off or somethin

And it had starbound, didnt regret the decision, pretty cheap for me"
Starbound,"Im so sad to admit that the games turned its tail due to purely nostalgia alone, I loved the games atmosphere and lore building between species as well as the music, even though the fighting elements isnt all that stellar, imposing a non negotiable lame lore on our character that ties in to progressing in the game was the worse decision they could make"
Starbound,It now costs $3.00 on steam
Starbound,The mods are what really take it to a whole other level
Starbound,I always take my time setting up a Home to be like real home. I always rush the base in Terraria. Starbound has a better base building experience. My rice farms are always easy food lol. Then I'll mix it up by making Risotto while never even having it in real life.
Starbound,This game would be a banger on Android
Starbound,as much as the story line failed the game is very much redeemed by mods such as fracking universe.
Starbound,"They stole so, so much money from their investors and backers it's insane. They had to run like two-three separate crowdfunding operations because their previous ones kept not being delivered upon and then what did they spend the money on - a new office and an office dog? Absolute scam."
Starbound,Looks like a terraria ripoff
Starbound,"Played it first when I was 8 or 9yo
Playing it again today as a 15yo and hearing the Chucklefish laugh and the beautiful soundtracks which i havent heard in years makes me shatter in tears

Such a great game with a great community
Thank you Starbound for making my childhood
I will never forget you
You always made me happy and you still do

Thank you."
Starbound,"There's a mod to straight up make the story optional or to cut it out of the game completely. FrackinUniverse is the real story, but you may argue that now instead of a space archeologist, you become a lab rat chasing crafting recipes and resources for those recipes."
Starbound,"I love this game with all my heart, but I have to put this disclaimer here. Performance can vary and or drop significantly. It is a known issue, I myself know little about what to do, but there are many who have found ways to improve it."
Starbound,Great video! I've been perusing articles talking about games similar to Subnautica and this one kept popping up. Looks right up my alley and seems to be a little less on the crafting side and more on action and exploration versus Terraria which seemed to be more on the crafting side. Should I play the vanilla game before adding mods?
Starbound,"24h lol... i've played 450h+ since early access. I've seen what this game was and what it become. The early versions even thought lack of content, where more fun and more sandbox play.... at the end they added a lot of useless features and force you to do the main quest to progress. Its is sad. I still play a little time from time for nostalgia, also the OST still awesome and chilin... but overrall, its and ok game."
Starbound,Learn boss movements? Nah bro i got 500 bandages
Starbound,"If you think the eyeball biome is horrifying, have fun with Atropus worlds from Frackin' Universe."
Starbound,"Sorry mate, there's nothing more pretentious than using the royal ""we."""
Starbound,"Even if the game is worth it, I would say Don't Buy It, after what the people in charge did to their developers, I don't think they deserve the money.
Here's a video detailing what happened if you are interested:
https://youtu.be/2i2_BUffRmM"
Starbound,Console? The game is only available on PC.
Starbound,"Well it's obviously am Not gonna buy it.





Am just download it for free with "" steam unlocked ""💪😎🧠"
Starbound,terraria bruh
Starbound,Wow I must have sucked at the game I beat it is 135 hours 😂
Starbound,Terraria but 10+
Starbound,Just bought the game. It’s amazing. You don’t even have to go crazy with mods. The base game has PLENTY to explore and do.
Starbound,"i am so sad, because i don't have any friend who wan't to play with my in starbound"
Starbound,"I've been playing this game for 4 months , beat Vanilla then continue play FU Mod , experimented with item network , build some bases abandoned it then build another  untill i reached understanding how item network works and efficient placement each lab's tool , storage and wiring , recently I created crystal farm collected around 20 million pixel finally bought Mega Capture Gun from Science Outpost , now I'm ready to end my journey. Basically lost interest after all those experience. Pretty fun and challenging also overwhelming. 

I'd say Vanilla still the best , just exploring planet after planet build base full with decorative, without overthinking about item network and farming."
Starbound,Just get Terraria.
Starbound,"I'll save you guys 8 minutes. Yes, you should buy it."
Starbound,"I mean, I bought the game yesterday since it was on sale. I think I am gonna enjoy it."
Starbound,Thanks for your video. What is your opinion about multiplayer (especially co-op building and exploring) in Starbound?
Starbound,It isn’t available on consoles
Starbound,"hate to break it to you, but you dont drop weapon or armor on death, thats most likely a mod that you have implemented. you do drop quite a bit of items though."
Starbound,"I loved this game when it was first released, but, come on, it is and always has been largely a Terraria knock off.  IMHO it started off somewhat better than Terraria, but has gotten worse with updates."
Starbound,Most mods are multiplayer compatible which i love about this game!
Starbound,Been playing this game about 8 months now. My favorite game of all time. Don’t understand all the hate
Starbound,i got this game when i was like 9 or 10 years old and im replaying it now lol
Starbound,I still play this with mods
Starbound,"$15? today it is ~$0.80 for me, no discount. final price"
Starbound,"If you are wanting to play Starbound to build bases and just explore repetitive biomes and planets, yes its a good game to play, if you want to play for the survivability and lore, no its not the game for you. Starbound managed to be better in the early Betas than it currently is today, it had a lot more weapon and mob varieties, more biomes and dungeon types which later got scrapped.

Some Biomes in the game are currently literally unexplorable as the game its self glitches and when you come close enough for those zones to load it instantly forces you back to your ship. In some cases this glitched biome is right at the arrival area of the planet which causes you to be unable to teleport down."
Starbound,Terraria 2.0 💀
Starbound,ACTUALLY UR WRONG. IT'S NOT ON CONSOLES. THEY SAID IT WOULD BE 4 YEARS BUT IT'S BEEN ABANDONED 4 BOTH PC & CONSOLE.
Starbound,I remember the announcement for what would basically be a space themed terraria and was so excited for the prerelease
Starbound,I love the personality of every species in the game
Starbound,"Minor complaint, but you didn't have to show or even mention the ""eyeball biome"" and you did. As someone who hasnt played the game that would have been a big shock to see for the first time but now it won't be. Unfortunate."
Starbound,YAYAYAYAYAY STARBOUND ISNT DED
Starbound,Id buy it for $30.  The gameplay is fun and the exploration is enjoyable.  Can we not forget the music?  The music is beautiful.  This game is an indie masterpiece.
Starbound,Haha jokes on you i got it for free!
Death's Door,"Looks like a great game, but what's with all the spoilers!? 😔 I seriously regret watching this video, and that shouldn't be the case for a review.."
Death's Door,Bro using the big words ‘melancholy
Death's Door,"Looks quite generic, not seeing how this is a 9."
Death's Door,"Heh, heh.  You said ""im'PECK'able."" Heh."
Death's Door,"Really hope Acid Nerve makes another zelda-like of this quality!!

Maybe sooner then 6 years thou."
Death's Door,Great video man and the game looks cool :]
Death's Door,boring and generic 4/10
Death's Door,"This game is awesome, 5/5 if you like Zelda I'm pretty sure you're going to like this game!"
Death's Door,AAA should have nothing to do with the budget. Because if you were to describe what a AAA title should have then this game would check all the boxes. This game is great. 10/10
Death's Door,My fav indie game since Hades
Death's Door,Whoa. Does the over dubbing of this occasionally make this one guy sound like two different narrators? Weird.
Death's Door,"game two game one rocket beans tv real madrid tyzak, strobel, bell, chiara, reichelt, falla"
Death's Door,"Fall guys led me here. never knew about this game but it looks interesting,I might get it"
Death's Door,"The worst part of this game is the slow movement. The maps are gigantic and towards the end, backtracking becomes so annoying."
Death's Door,Freed from his mortal coil
Death's Door,9.5/10
Death's Door,"Wish someone would make a game with these visuals, but without all the combat and needing to ""charge your magic"". It would be targeting a lot of us who want a nice game like this but are not into the whole Zelda/Mana/etc thing. <3 Do I keep it on my wishlist or not?"
Death's Door,CLASSIC
Death's Door,Grade A game :) worth a play
Death's Door,"great game, frustrating puzzles. an example i'd like to pull out is the frozen canyon puzzle.
its timed, so you'll have to try to be as fast as possible. thing is, your on ice and can fall off at any given moment.
its slippery too, and the 'checkpoints' are in my opinion, the worst. sometimes, it just brings right back to the start,
even if you didnt run out of hp. it would be nice if you could just go back from where you fell from so that it wont be so frustrating to go back to the start, and go the way only to fall off the ice and get teleported to the beginning."
Death's Door,INCREDIBLE GAME!. It has the souls of SNES classics within it. Many thanks to the developers and to Game Pass!
Death's Door,"Took me a long 22 hours to finish this game 100% 

Worth every minute. Beautiful, beautiful game. It will test your patience at times but keep at it, the end is extremely satisfying."
Death's Door,looks fun reminds me of skylanders in some way
Death's Door,What are more games like deaths door
Death's Door,Boring game
Death's Door,more games like this?
Death's Door,Love this review
Death's Door,"Any similar, cheap indie games guys?"
Death's Door,"No health bar for the bosses! Why does no one talk about this? It's not a feature, it's lazy development."
Death's Door,It's now on game pass everyone 😁
Death's Door,"Game pass ,yeeeeess"
Death's Door,Now on gamepass.
Death's Door,"Looks enjoyable.
One day when we will struggle to buy the next RTX Card and we gone recognice, we dont need one to have fun."
Death's Door,This game has one of the best soundtracks of recent memory. Absolutely phenomenal
Death's Door,"Amazing game, much much better than the so called AAA games."
Death's Door,"jogo bem fds, baza uns cod warzone"
Death's Door,"Reminds me of hyper light drifter, Will definitely check it out"
Death's Door,"THIS GAME HAS THE MOST AMAZING SOUNDTRACK EVER, RIGHT BESIDE CHRONO TRIGGER"
Death's Door,I’m sold!
Death's Door,Is this game like dark souls at all?
Death's Door,Well written review.
Death's Door,"Great game, fluid combat"
Death's Door,You can play it now on switch
Death's Door,تونس
Death's Door,This looks absolutely stunning.
Death's Door,It challenged him in “all the right ways”
Death's Door,This look beautiful
Death's Door,So happy this is finally coming to Switch!!
Death's Door,Meh doesn’t look great to me.
Death's Door,Preordered it for PS4 and can't wait to play it.
Death's Door,this reminds of monument valley
Death's Door,Is this the same makes from bastion ????
Death's Door,Wow...it's beautiful.
Death's Door,What’s reply value like
Death's Door,"urgh zelda style, be an open world game"
Death's Door,Anyone else here after the state of play trailer?
Death's Door,"You mic is terrible. You sound like you are talking into cup. How do you not notice this? Couldn't watch this, sheesh."
Death's Door,"Just finished the game 100%, worth every penny"
Death's Door,Game is fire
Death's Door,So it's hyper light drifter with a different art style?
Death's Door,Would like for Switch plis 😢
Death's Door,This game is fantasic
Death's Door,This is a sequel to titan souls
Death's Door,One of the BEST games of this year
Death's Door,"Altho a nice game, it's not really pleasant to restart a battle from  a distant save point. I've always hated this kind of save systems and they are not respectful for gamers who play occasionally with limited time. Just make it possible to at least replay a (gates close behind you) battle, instead of backtracking the whole bit.

This is way to time consuming and backtracking isn't really the nicest part of the game."
Death's Door,Looks like one of the ducks from the kurzgesagt videos.
Death's Door,steam deck pls
Death's Door,So basically it's a prettier less cryptic version of Hyperlight Drifter
Death's Door,This game beats E3 this year
Death's Door,Didnt mention the music. Music is AMAZING!
Death's Door,Loved this damn game.  Check it out!
Death's Door,"Best game I’ve played in the past 5yrs, and really not happy gonna end soon. If you like Zelda or my all time favorite Super Medtronic then this should be for you 😁😁"
Death's Door,Looks like a more refined hyper light drifter.
Death's Door,A seemingly perfect game for the Switch… that’s not available on the Switch. 😕
Death's Door,This or the ascend?
Death's Door,Thx you for making new ppl know this underrated game
Death's Door,this is just the better version of minecraft dungeons tbh
Death's Door,There is beauty in an ending 😌
Death's Door,Worth every penny 👍🏻
Death's Door,"Hoping this'll eventually come to Game Pass, then i'll play through there"
Death's Door,So is this basically a 3D Hollow Knight?
Death's Door,A perfect game for my steam deck
Death's Door,Go Xbox go!
Death's Door,Zelda meets dark souls= deaths door
Death's Door,It's the best 20 dollar game ever better than alot of triple As out there and only 20 bucks
Death's Door,"The audio sounds like you guys went back and added in certain lines afterwards, you can totally tell when his voice audio quality suddenly gets more clear"
Death's Door,WHY THE HELL IS THIS ONLY ON XBOX AND PC
Death's Door,Everyone say BarZig BarZig
Death's Door,New legend is born.  Another great intro into metroidvania arena
Death's Door,Does this game have cross play between Xbox and PC? Thanks.
Death's Door,just imagine playing this on the Steam Deck. 🤩
Death's Door,"This game desperately needs accessibility features. Come on guys, this stuff should be standard at this point."
Death's Door,"Reminds me of a darker, quieter Bastion"
Death's Door,"I’ll wait for it on Gamepass, but looks fun."
Death's Door,3:38 Spirited Away anyone?
Death's Door,"No Switch release, no buy."
Death's Door,It's a perfect game for a Steam Deck!
Death's Door,Sleeper of the year and momentary GOTY for me.
Death's Door,Hopefully this ends up on GamePass.  Looks dope!
Death's Door,Gorgeous. Beautiful. Majestic.
Death's Door,I get tunic vibes
Death's Door,8:29 and then thre's betty's theme
Death's Door,A crow wtf
Death's Door,Not enough lovely people so it's a 4 out of 10 for the review and a 7.5 out of 10 for the game 👍😎
Death's Door,"Just got it today, OMG this game is AMAZING"
Death's Door,Just wanted to say I just finished Death's Door last weekend I really enjoyed it! Such a good game :)
Death's Door,The art style alone makes me wanna play this game
Death's Door,This looks really good.
Death's Door,Why can't top down Zelda be this cool and challenging? Sad
Death's Door,"I had played deaths door on the switch before. Took me a few sittings to get to the urn witch and i never coninued after that because I had stuff come up and then I sold my switch. Sat down to play it on my xbox series S yesterday and it felt like a completely different game, I enjoyed it much more on the xbox."
Death's Door,No English Captions?
Death's Door,"I’ve watched a couple videos on this game. And that castle boss - the boss that’s a damn castle - always takes my breath away. 
I think I really should go back and complete Hades before I pick up this game, however."
Death's Door,Comparing this crap to zelda? O_o
Death's Door,This game is a masterpiece! I am glad my Xbox gamepass made me come across it. Wow!
Death's Door,"Try not to speak for everyone because that was not a good way to start this video at all. Just because a clone of an original game looks ""bad"" because of the same design and gameply and doesn't ""capture what this game can originally do"" doesn't mean everyone will be a sheep and automatically hate it. Some will like it some won't. It's simple. Implementing new ideas to a game isn't easy since another company could be using the same idea without knowing. For example I hate Dark Souls games a lot, but they all play the exact same with only just a few new things for each installment which the fans don't mind. How many 2D Super Mario games were made from the last to now that were exactly the same, but introduce a few new stuff? A lot. As long as a game is fun to the player then it literally doesn't matter how ""bad"" or good it is. Anyway I already have this game on the Playstation and it's a fun one."
Death's Door,"*explains the level design* 
Oh, so it’s dark souls"
Death's Door,Unfortunately I find it’s plays more like Dark souls than Zelda and I can not stand Dark souls. Nintendo really need to implement a refund system.
Death's Door,"I've been stung HARD this year by games which all have in common isometric camera-angles: I wish I had researched Hades just a BIT harder before buying it to have known how the whole game is really just a SUPER grind; 3D World was like a taking an open-top tour-bus ride in a city like London but on the wettest day of the year; and Link's Awakening--Remake just sucked, HAAAAARD. BUT, this one does look pretty good and I'm not traumatised enough by isometric camera-angles just YET to forsake all games made with them. Cheers for the preview!"
Death's Door,Pretty overrated imo.
Death's Door,Should I buy Death's Door or Raji? Anyone?
Death's Door,"It looks more like Hades that Zelda, even in the mechanic"
Death's Door,You kept repeating it brings nothing new so many times like the majority of games in recent year did anything new in the first place. The only game that actually may have done new things in recent memory is botw.
Death's Door,“in which to plant it in” ya dont need the second in
Death's Door,What's this Souls game they mentioned?  I'm intrigued.
Death's Door,amazing game this is a must play
Death's Door,"Sometimes a game doesn’t have to be “new”, it just has to be good."
Death's Door,But when will physical copies be available?
Death's Door,"""That's kafkaesque, yo"""
Death's Door,"Don't get it, critics don't like Baldo, but like this one? meh"
Death's Door,"There are many things they got wrong with this game
- no map
- health plants are often far away
- doesn't seem to be anyway to block the enemies hits so your just a sponge till you die
- if you die you start back at the door
- no difficulty levels, it's just difficult

It's just a very frustrating game that could have been a classic"
Death's Door,YouTube=ads YouTube=ads YouTube=ads YouTube=ads
Death's Door,"The first thing you get to fight in the game is a boss and it's too difficult to avoid and you only have low health so no chance, avoid this game"
Death's Door,"“This game really makes you feel like a bird zelda dark soul”
-10/10, IGN"
Death's Door,My fave game this year. I might double dip on the Switch!
Death's Door,I really don’t like this obsession with “Insert Term” - Like to describe literally every game.
Death's Door,If Diablo and zelda had a baby.
Death's Door,I’ve been waiting for its port since release. A game for Zelda and Souls fans? I’m definitely not missing this!
Death's Door,Why do they strip games of colour? 🤮
Death's Door,"Really want a physical copy of this, it looks so good."
Death's Door,More Zion Personal Thoughts Please 2021!
Death's Door,Just picked it up. 10/10 Could not put it down.
Death's Door,"Would have got it on Switch but it was half the cost on GoG and can make use of 165fps, pure butter. But it should be stellar on Swich, Unity is well optimised."
Death's Door,"Looks cool, you have a good point on being Jaded( it can happen with a lot of Genres)"
Death's Door,Happy this came to other platforms. Definitely a hidden gem of this year.
Death's Door,It looks like Oninaki
Death's Door,Not enough color. Seems drab.
Death's Door,Can’t wait for this game.
Death's Door,Want.. way too much in my backlog
Death's Door,"It's really good 😎👍 played it on XBox 
Just pre-ordered the physical special edition"
Death's Door,I always knew this would come to switch
Death's Door,"It looks pretty drab and ugly looking, could do with more colours"
Death's Door,POTHEAD
Death's Door,"The only problem that i find is that where i live (Colombia) the game is way more cheaper on steam, the games on switch are such so expensive (including the indies if we compare them to the steam version)"
Death's Door,"zion, the most boring of the 3.."
Death's Door,"Really enjoyed this one :) I hope their earlier game, Titan Souls, gets on switch too!"
Death's Door,Oh my god the moving castle boss. just look at it.
Death's Door,now every game is “zelda-like” 🙄
Death's Door,death door is really good worth on switch.
Death's Door,Zelda like .... WTF?
Death's Door,When an ispirication game is good is really good
Death's Door,Just ordered a physical copy from Special Reserve! I’m can’t wait!
Death's Door,The frame rate looks like it's all over the place in the footage. I'll have to try the game on something other than the Switch.
Death's Door,"You say it's Zelda like, but the isometric camera angle is giving me Diablo vibes."
Death's Door,"I have it on Xbox, great game."
Death's Door,"Puts ""must play"" in the thumbnail and has ""is it worth it"" in the title.... I somehow think I know your answer haha"
Death's Door,"yes its worth it very beautiful game with enchanting soundtrack 
and very detailed"
Death's Door,Yessss it came to switch
Death's Door,"I want to wait until the physical, but I might not be able to get it until April so I'm considering double dipping"
Death's Door,"I can never finish these type of indie games because I get bored and play something else. They just feel empty and copy-pasted. I prefer the lower budget indie games to be short and sweet, like Toree 3D or A Short Hike. Just my opinion."
Death's Door,I've got a physical copy ordered. 👍
Death's Door,"im gonna buy it someday, but ive bought and have SOOO many games on my backlog, i gotta relax"
Death's Door,You guys -murdered- this game review about a crow. Teehee.
Death's Door,"I have all the standard games for switch (Oddesey, Zelda etc), but pretty much just played dead cells for about 200hours😅"
Death's Door,"Just bought it yesterday and playing it rn. Had $7 in my coins so I said screw it, the game looks good."
Death's Door,"Truly a masterpiece, I've played on xbox but if they release a physical edition later I'll definitively gonna buy it again"
Death's Door,"I haven't played this game, I don't know what it is about, but i kinda wish you can turn off the blood splatter, I don't have anything against blood, hell, I'm an MD, and im totally used to play violent games, but idk, there's something about the blood here that makes me feel like it doesn't belong, I think that I'd enjoy it more if I could turn it off."
Death's Door,Glad y’all liked this so much. I bought it a few days ago. So much fun. And while it may not be anything new. There’s more than enough there and enough uniqueness to keep things exciting
Death's Door,"I'm waiting for Life's Door instead, this game is too dark for me."
Death's Door,I love how many unique games are still releasing on the switch
Death's Door,Second
Limbo,"This, for me, is a well done review, short, objective and concise."
Limbo,"Just beat this game on the Switch - it was enjoyable, if not terribly challenging. Sure, you die a lot, but once something kills you the first time, it’s pretty clear what you need to do next. Only a handful of situations require precise timing. So yeah- the main thing the game does right is not overstaying its welcome. 

And the end to this game does not belong anywhere on a list of best game endings. It’s one of the most abrupt and meaningless endings I’ve ever experienced."
Limbo,Limbo is one of my absolutely favorite and stunning video games ever too!
Limbo,Just got it for free with some switch points. It was great especially the first half
Limbo,Clever puzzles??? Limbo????
Limbo,Ten thousand ways to kill a boy!! … great game by the way 👍
Limbo,"This is a must play game if you like 2d platformers! Suspense, dark, puzzles!"
Limbo,Loved this game!
Limbo,PagMan
Limbo,Little nightmares and Hallow knights are far better in my opinion
Limbo,"2 dollars on switch now !! Buy it , it’s a masterpiece. Just finished it it in 6 hours, it was worth every second !"
Limbo,"This is just like an ""Out of This world"" reboot"
Limbo,"For 3,49€ in microsoft store now! Thanx for the great review!!!"
Limbo,this is little nightmares i swear
Limbo,Back then when IGN has a common sense for reviews
Limbo,This is German Expressionism not film noir
Limbo,"Don’t let the short length distract you : cons, short?????"
Limbo,"1:47
“I like ya cut g”"
Limbo,Back when IGN knew what they were doing *sigh*
Limbo,"I just got it free on epic games, its awesome"
Limbo,Free on epic at the moment.
Limbo,Who just downloaded inside for free on Xbox and loved it and now are here
Limbo,platformer with spiders.
Limbo,2019? Who came here after inside
Limbo,2019 anyone?
Limbo,Back when games was masterpiece
Limbo,"I like these types of games but many tend to have a lack of a story or are just a little too short. That's why I like Valiant hearts since it just played with your emotions. As well as an awesome art style, pacing and gameplay variation."
Limbo,Just bought the limbo/inside bundle for 5 dollars
Limbo,Approximately how long is limbo?
Limbo,Best games......
Limbo,"This game is great, I'm usually not a fan of platformers let alone puzzle games but limbo hooked me from the first level it's truly amazing"
Limbo,I don't which game I died more in Bloodborne or Limbo.
Limbo,this game was a masterpiece
Limbo,"after playing ""Inside"" I can't wait for their next game."
Limbo,"The game does not avoid being frustrating.  I don't enjoy trying puzzles over and over until I get them right.  I prefer studying my surroundings and figuring it out on the first try.  Unfortunately, Limbo puts you in plenty of situations where you are under time pressure and will die if you don't figure the puzzle out on first glance.  But I guess that's just my preference clashing with the game design..."
Limbo,I want to lim bo program
Limbo,is it worth 11$
Limbo,does anyone know what the background music is?
Limbo,After seeing a giant spider I expected more creepy monsters but that's just it. I enjoyed the game but lack of monsters and the ending kinda disappointed me.
Limbo,"Who came here after ""inside"" game"
Limbo,Spider
Limbo,me
Limbo,I think it was the perfect length for what was in it. There wasn't a heavy plot to carry it any longer and with this type of gameplay it's very linear so you can't really keep people's attention for any longer than the game's length to be honest. Definitely deserves its score though and hopefully Inside can fill the story and game mechanics gap that Limbo forgivably lacked somewhat.
Limbo,currently this game is free on steam!!!
Limbo,LIMBO si free until tomorow
Limbo,"the cutsences is what make the game longer or other gamplay, can you imegn how short ff7 will be without the turn based combat ( sorry for my bad english)"
Limbo,"The story is about a boy who doesn't understand why he is in limbo, and why his sister died. Next time actually read the game description."
Limbo,"He says that it being short isn't too bad and then lowers the score because of it? I'm happy with the length, I probably wouldn't fully play it if it was over 10 hours"
Limbo,It's free on Xbox now
Limbo,"Just finish the game.

Cons: too short

Pros: everything else"
Limbo,I'm not playing this game for one solid reason.......the spider
Limbo,"This game is currently 3$ on the play station store, should i get it"
Limbo,"try LITTLE WHEEL game on miniclip.com its the story of a robot n its similar to this game , its a very nice game"
Limbo,"playing the demo , really enjoying it , I might buy the full ps4 version also ..."
Limbo,Not a fan of all the anti-gravity stuff in the last third of the game.
Limbo,this game sucks
Limbo,I m waiting for Inside
Limbo,People are sayin it only took them about 2-3 hours to complete. As an official dumbass I can confirm the game actually takes about 5-6 hours to complete.
Limbo,free on psn plus atm
Limbo,"My record is just over an hour, but first time through its probably 3-4 hours not 5-6, and neither of those times would be short for a 2D platformer"
Limbo,I don't think 5-6 hours is short for an indie side scroller.
Limbo,1:47 ouch that looks like it hurts
Limbo,What is the name of the music that is being played in the beginning of the game? 
Limbo,It's like a David Lynch film!
Limbo,if u liked this game I would recommend playing Heart of Darkness on ps1 it's even better 
Limbo,This is IGN's 26th favorite modern game
Limbo,This game plus the weeknd
Limbo,This song +the weeknd
Limbo,"When I got that spider, i was playing in the dark, with headphones. Scared the living shit outta me."
Limbo,which is better? limbo or lone survivor?
Limbo,5-6 hr ? liar
Limbo,Free on ps vita for ps plus members!
Limbo,Another shitty indie game that's over hyped. Will never download a single one of the things. Cant even believe these are for some considered GOTY
Limbo,"it started out strong with a good horror atmosphere and enemies but then halfway through.. drops the enemies/horror and replaces it with annoying trial and error puzzles. this game is NOT a 9, more like a 6 ."
Limbo,"A 6 hour game that is good from beginning to finish is better than a longer game that overstays its welcome. Smartest thing I've ever heard from IGN. I'm downloading this now, but good review."
Limbo,$3.75 for PS Plus members. Definitely buying it!
Limbo,"""It's one of my favorite games, ever."" 9.0 Um, ok. lol."
Limbo,"wtf? You stated that it is okay that the game is short, yet you listed it in the cons of the final verdict."
Limbo,iOS $1.99 totally worth it haha!
Limbo,and its is again!
Limbo,"Ign is a fucking tool to rate games, its wasnt short or long it was a perfect amount of time, and if it was short what would you expect a $15 games length would be?"
Limbo,Or you can just download it for free.
Limbo,"Limbo Steam code whoever gets it first.
ECHHP-V2WGZ-QXLJ8"
Limbo,On the Humble Bundle 9 NOW!
Limbo,On the Humble Bundle 9 NOW!
Limbo,On the Humble Bundle 9 NOW!
Limbo,Now you know how it feels to be a PC user with the last of us and GTA 5.
Limbo,5 dollars in humblebundle  +9 games 
Limbo,HUMBLE BUNDLE
Limbo,I have a 50 % coupon for it :D
Limbo,I wish they would release it in physical disc form though for the ps3.
Limbo,he said he would rather play an amazing short game rather than play a not very good long game not that it was good that it was short
Limbo,"I want a Limbo 2 as much as I want an Inception 2, but neither of those are likely. If they do happen though, that would be great."
Limbo,"One of the greatest indie games EVER made, period."
Limbo,Free on Piratebay forever
Limbo,"reminds me of machinarium , def worth buying "
Limbo,Nope
Limbo,It's on ios now
Limbo,any difference on getting xbla vs ios version?
Limbo,This is free on xboxlive right now
Limbo,One of the best iOS games I’ve ever played honestly. I love the dark theme of it and the puzzles are sometimes challenging.
Limbo,"I agree with most everything said in this video- by modern standards, the game is fine, but not that great.

As an aside, I don’t understand the love for the ending of this game- it was incredibly abrupt and seemingly meaningless."
Limbo,i really want to get the game now!
Limbo,"Wow, I never thought about Inside being in the same universe as Limbo, let alone being a prequel to it. This changes everything"
Limbo,Great video! This game is awesome!
Superhot VR,Super hot: is amazing! It’s one of the most innovative shooters I’ve played in years!
Superhot VR,They make it look so easy 😂
Superhot VR,game is definitly not a 9/10
Superhot VR,Every single one of these VR games look like garbage.
Superhot VR,"I really want to buy the game but I heard its kind of a short game...
Thoughts?"
Superhot VR,Perfect if you want commit a school shooting. Great training.
Superhot VR,When I play this game it make me think the enemies  that i shoot and tab are my family.
Superhot VR,It really makes you FEEL like your feel like a superhero
Superhot VR,"My favourite part of superhot is when there's three enemies, one with a gun, and you shoot the gun guy, grab his gun as it goes towards you, and shoot the two remaining guys at once."
Superhot VR,I’d adore this game if it wasn’t so goddamn hard
Superhot VR,How much is it
Superhot VR,my mom will not buy me vr headset
Superhot VR,i feel like super hot vr was way too short.
Superhot VR,Superhot is the most innovative shooter I've played in years!
Superhot VR,Super hot is the most innovative shooter I’ve played in years
Superhot VR,It’s best on the quest. Play it there
Superhot VR,It’s the most innovative shooter I’ve played in years!
Superhot VR,"Superhot is the most innovative shooter I've played in years! You guys definitely should try it, whether or not it's VR doesn't matter, but it's available on practically every platform!"
Superhot VR,"Vï,4úş,"
Superhot VR,The quest makes this game amazing
Superhot VR,1:04 I flinched. Am I the only one? lol
Superhot VR,"Psvr is probably the worst port, it had terrible tracking and probably made everyone think it was just the camera's position"
Superhot VR,wouldnt call it a 9
Superhot VR,ninjas usually don't shoot your face off
Superhot VR,"played this for the first time at my friend's house yesterday, felt like John Wick in the Matrix"
Superhot VR,Eagerly waiting ps5 Vr headset. Never experienced vr.
Superhot VR,"Superhot pc: 7.5
Superhot VR: 9.0
Does VR really make that much of a difference"
Superhot VR,Played this on Oculus Quest this week. It is brilliant!
Superhot VR,Thinking of getting a PS4 with this. Never had a console before. (Apart from wii).
Superhot VR,Best $16 ive ever spent on a summer sale!
Superhot VR,"no crossbuy, no thanks."
Superhot VR,"I bought this game not knowing move controllers were needed and I can't even play it. 

Of course Dan didn't mention that in his video review."
Superhot VR,Short case scenario for whoever just went to the comments it is only positive comment
Superhot VR,"nobody ever fully mentions the story, wonder why..."
Superhot VR,How is this lower than fortnite?
Superhot VR,This game makes me feel like James Bond lol
Superhot VR,My favorite thing to do is hide behind crates hahaha
Superhot VR,Soo... Whats you're conclusion?
Superhot VR,I think Sony have made some improvements with hand tracking etc since this game was released. I played it on a friends PSVR about a year ago and it was troublesome. I now have VR myself however and the tracking seems way better than back then. Firmware/software updates etc?
Superhot VR,"Didn't know you can block bullets with weapons, thanks 😄"
Superhot VR,O SO NORMAL SUPER HOT GETS A 7.5 !? REALLY
Superhot VR,woah ign gave a vr game higher than 5? game informer's vr scoring scale goes from 1-5 out of 10.
Superhot VR,the way my psvr is set up makes it easy for it to keep track of the controllers so this game works for me
Superhot VR,"SuperHOT- Not VR 7.5
SuperHOT- With VR 9.0"
Superhot VR,Good review i give it about the same score
Superhot VR,On PSVR is not that good
Superhot VR,like skyrim with guns
Superhot VR,In my opinion super hot works better in vr
Superhot VR,I think this game should get 10/10. Its so awesome!
Superhot VR,Robo Recall
Superhot VR,I'm shocked!!!IGN actually gave a PSVR game some love???..about time
Superhot VR,Seriously sick vr game buy it
Superhot VR,How do u get ign?
Superhot VR,Where are the pros and cons?
Superhot VR,More PSVR content
Superhot VR,"This is one of my fav VR game, and game period. Amazing experience."
Superhot VR,"People still care about VR? The 1000 dollar gimmick that can't even provide better gaming experiences than iOS? lol. Maybe for racing or flying sims. Aside from that, it's quite the overpriced trash."
Superhot VR,PSVR seems to be a shit😏
Superhot VR,This comment is going to get likes for no reason.
Superhot VR,"high reviews everywhere, but i really cannot appreciate the game by just looking at it. the whitish graphic is a turn off for me."
Superhot VR,Totally not late
Superhot VR,"""unfair deaths"", please IGN, review the game itself and don't blame it for errors the players committed."
Superhot VR,"1:31
I think your VR might be busted because for me it's fine."
Superhot VR,"Love this game, straight up badass simulator. More VR content please IGN!"
Superhot VR,"https://soundcloud.com/robbythebest

You won't be disappointed."
Superhot VR,"Thank you Dan! We appreciate the VR love! This is easily my favorite VR game, and I know I'm not alone there!"
Superhot VR,"everything was great


till PlayStation VR"
Superhot VR,Ign step your game up with vr reviews. There's so many vr games out there that are great and you guys slack showing them some love.
Superhot VR,"Most Fun Game I've ever played! 
SUPERHOT IS SUPERFUN!!"
Superhot VR,This is awesome on the vive
Superhot VR,its too short which makes it a ripoff unless theirs a massive sale
Superhot VR,WOW IGN has actually realized that awesome VR Games are there. Nice Review thx
Superhot VR,Too much white
Superhot VR,This game is really more like a 7. The PSVR tracking for this is really terrible. Sony really needs to release an updated camera that can move and auto-focus. It surely couldn't cost that much to do. That kind of tech was in the original Kinect after all.
Superhot VR,Lohg
Superhot VR,Spot on review! Thanks IGN people for giving us some love
Superhot VR,"That would be a wicked vr game, ""slo' motion ninja hero"""
Superhot VR,"Superhot VR is the killer app for VR we've all been waiting for, its freaking amazing!"
Superhot VR,9.0. It sounded more like a 5.0. This game looks awesome.
Superhot VR,IGN plz slow down keep it down to like 5-7 types of vids too many vids just kinda bog me down I have considered unsubscribing but don't really want to
Superhot VR,"To be fair super hot VR is pretty much what VR is made for, and it's what they need to carry on going for if they want virtual reality to stay popular"
Superhot VR,Wow they didn't even talk about the other game modes you get :S
Superhot VR,Love that they are starting to cover VR more. Probably figured with the recent Oculus price drop more people were jumping in.
Superhot VR,lol psvr makes me wanna throw up
Superhot VR,"Look at all these brokes kids pretending they've tried VR. For VR owners, we know you're lying. We demo VR to ours friends and we understand how much of a game changer it is. We've seen the real reactions."
Superhot VR,Finally a good Vr game!!
Superhot VR,ridiculously late
Superhot VR,This came out like 6 months ago.
Superhot VR,These reviews are hilariously short
Superhot VR,"The score is 4 


Thank me later"
Superhot VR,hahaha these comments are toxic just like ign
Superhot VR,damn. shouldve waited because a patch nist dropped that improved pro performance and added a chaperone system and better load times
Superhot VR,I was about to go to pc gaming then went to ps4 gaming and got a vr..... wow I wish I went to pc after all the problems I had with my PS4 and the bad tracking on vr
Superhot VR,"Куплинов (КуплиНео, Куплитан Америка, Кама Купля) уже прошел😊😊😊"
Superhot VR,SWEET DOLLA TEA FROM McDONALD'S
Superhot VR,Is it free
Superhot VR,"Thumbs up your doing some great VR reviews lately IGN. Many people hold off from vr because they think ""there are no good games"". So some mass media coverage could definitly help to boost this awesome medium a bit quicker into the mainstream ;)

PS: Robo Recall or DIno Frontier Next? ;)"
Superhot VR,you are JUST reviewing it?
Superhot VR,SONG AT 0:16 PLEASE
Superhot VR,Screw your 30 second ads IGN.
Superhot VR,"SONNY. JIM. SONNY. JIM. SONNY. JIM. SONNY. JIM.

My man Gggman is on a roll, boys"
Superhot VR,Getting shot right between the eyes freaks me out. Literally makes me scream ahhh
Superhot VR,Yeah this game makes you SUPER HOT
Superhot VR,The most innovative shooter I've played in years
Superhot VR,"Fuck, I was down as soon as you said you could deflect bullets with cleavers."
Superhot VR,I played this at my friend’s house once and never played the regular version again.
Superhot VR,"I found this game infuriating
It has hitboxes for the player larger than goddamn steve from minecraft."
Superhot VR,You in your underwear some would say thats.........Super Hot
Superhot VR,Just by any chance. When you was talking about how un-interesting the story actually  is and people over bloating the whole meta analysis. Where you taking a stab at GiantBomb?
Superhot VR,"""i know you don't want the mental image of me standing around in my underwear"" 
who would not want that"
Superhot VR,"Wow, games like this make me want to get a Rift. Interesting how we're getting to an age where you play video games to burn calories. ""I gotta go lose some weight, time to go play some video games.""
...full circle gentleman (and women), full circle."
Superhot VR,"Loving this game! Superhot is right though, my Oculus is soaking wet after 30 mins..."
Superhot VR,"Great review, what program did you use to record a game play video from a rift?"
Superhot VR,I headbutted my desk when playing this.
Superhot VR,"re: 7:08 comment, this game is why i bought an oculus, I was such a big fan of the original I wanted to play the VR version. So it at least drew one person onto the platform."
Superhot VR,I spent too long trying to make your cursor move with my mouse.
Superhot VR,"This game looks interesting in that there seems to be more strategy required than your typical VR wave shooter. Interesting that it doesn't seem like there's really any background music either, which will make the experience different than others. I think I'll definitely be picking this up in the next couple of weeks."
Superhot VR,i actually did buy a rift mostly for this game...
Superhot VR,when max payne takes LSD
Superhot VR,"Wow, I was never interested in this game before, but with the VR version, it seems like it has reached its potential, like it was meant for VR."
Superhot VR,But you are disabled in this version...
Superhot VR,"looks cool af, but they could add a lot more content"
Superhot VR,Did you try Serious Sam VR?
Superhot VR,"""...so keep that sudo-intellectual analysis crap for Kotaku or Polygon.""  :D sooo that's done. © Sonny Jim"
Superhot VR,another great video review Gggmanlives
Superhot VR,Is he using oculus rift or ps vr
Superhot VR,Yeah but can you aim gangsta style?
Superhot VR,I uninstalled this game after a few hours of play as I was never able to get used to its slow-motion mechanic. For me the way it works in games like Max Payne makes more sense.
Superhot VR,Can you please review Armed and dangerous or Stubbs the Zombie :D
Superhot VR,Who said we don't want to think about you in your underwear.
Superhot VR,hey Gggman will u ever review vietcong 2?
Superhot VR,Ever thought of reviewing the rest of the Halo series?
Superhot VR,"Jimmy Son, you need to reduce your daily intake of Foster's, kangaroo meat and ostrich eggs if you're sweating profusely while playing this game!"
Superhot VR,"Bayonetta. Released yesterday on Steam. Please do a video on it. Same story as Bulletstorm, but done right. It's a 2010 game's first pc release, that costs 20$ now (digital deluxe edition for that price till april 25) by Platinum, who said to PC gamer ""if it were up to us, we’d port all of our games to PC, but it all depends on the publishers"" (and everybody wants Vanquish). So maximum coverage for bringing great games to pc platform :D"
Superhot VR,"Agreed fully, this game and VR were destined to be together."
Superhot VR,"Loving your VR videos my man, SuperHot is absolutely my go-to VR demo game; friends love it so much I basically need to rip it away from them. Definitely the type of game where you take off your headset and realize it's been 6 hours and all of your muscles are aching."
Superhot VR,i bouth an oculus just for this game 😂
Superhot VR,lol. kotaku and polygon
Superhot VR,can u do resident evil 4 pls
Superhot VR,Wow this might very well be the first game utilizing VR potential.
Superhot VR,Can you do that cool thing from the matrix?
Superhot VR,"I went to the Super Hot studio when I was collaborating on animation with students at Lodz film school since it was developed by alumni and they were impressed I knew this game.
Although we didn't have too much time to check out Superhot VR, we did get our first taste of VR in this studio."
Superhot VR,"Between this and Robo Recall...

<puts on fake neckbeard>
IT'S VIRTUAL TIME."
Superhot VR,3:40 was by far the best footage that was some shit straight outta action movie
Superhot VR,At least you're getting some exercise!
Superhot VR,haven't been here for awhile
Superhot VR,"Ugh, I cringed when you said ""safe space."" I know you meant differently, but that phrase is forever ruined for me."
Superhot VR,Nice roast of kotacu and polygon
Superhot VR,Wait so the VR version doesn't have the assault rifle?
Superhot VR,So you broke TWO controllers playing VR?
Superhot VR,Sonny Jim how many uploads can you do in a week! Jeebus Christ!
Superhot VR,"I know you're internet isn't the best, but do you ever play Overwatch?"
Superhot VR,Now I just want to see you do a review of Johnny Walker Red Label.
Superhot VR,New Vr Android Game for Google cardboard https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thunderofaction.helicopter_race
Superhot VR,John Wick the game!
Superhot VR,"""or from Lagavulin back to Jonny Walker"" lulz."
Superhot VR,Hope they release it on the vive soon...
Superhot VR,"Holy fucking shit. This is the reason for VR right here. I've wanted to try horror games and such, but this looks like the fucking holy grail of a VR experience. The shit you pulled off legitimately blew me away and got me giddy thinking about trying anything I can. Like THAT is what I want to do in a shooter like this. Really wanted to try Superhot before, but fuck this is just beyond a doubt the best version and I've never played either. Too bad I have no VR"
Superhot VR,7:35 Legawhat?
Superhot VR,GGGman is on a roll with the reviews
Superhot VR,>:( NO VIVE SUPPORT! although im a huge gun nut! (being murican and all) So its not all bad since the vive has Hotdogs Horseshoes and Hand Grenades!!!!
Superhot VR,man this is what could be the true game of the matrix movie  with VR you are neo
Superhot VR,Review swords with sauce alpha
Superhot VR,Superhot 2 : Even hotter
Superhot VR,SUPER HOT. Best played naked with the curtains open.
Superhot VR,"Loving your VR reviews, really made me want to buy one. Maybe in 8 years..."
Superhot VR,"Try Compound VR, its got an awesome art style"
Superhot VR,"Shit, the gameplay looks like something out of a trailer, and that's a good thing. Shame I don't got a rift or a powerful enough computer, or I would totally get this game, and robo recall."
Superhot VR,I'm so happy that I was the first man on earth to watch this video.
Superhot VR,Do you have a Vive?
Superhot VR,"1:25 dare I say the ""ShiD Pa Town"" XD"
Superhot VR,"Good job man,  I love your content so much! Really well made and fun."
Superhot VR,Now THIS is what could convince me to invest in VR... after robbing several banks to get the money.
Superhot VR,"Damn, you got skills, Sonny Jim."
Superhot VR,The ABSOLUTE FUCKING MADMAN IS AT IT AGAIN
Superhot VR,I preffer VHS over soulless bluray
Superhot VR,"Too much moving, eh lads"
Superhot VR,I put my cursor over yours. I've been inside you now.
Superhot VR,The story in this was pretentious garbage. Needed many more levels and editing tools.
Superhot VR,I played around with my GearVR and nearly threw up a kidney. How's the nausea/headache for you?
Superhot VR,"I enjoyed the video my dude, just try to keep that mouse cursor off the screen in your future videos."
Superhot VR,"Man so many new videos, I love it!"
Superhot VR,I wish I could rent a VR set from blockbuster for the one ore two cars it really shines for.
Superhot VR,I want the image of you in your underwear anyday.
Superhot VR,Still waiting for a tank war like game on VR.
Superhot VR,A Matrix VR game by these guys would be great
Superhot VR,Idk what but could you try to do some reviews on some older games if you have times. There my favorate
Superhot VR,"Damn you've been posting all week, are you going to do first encounter VR"
Superhot VR,"And they don't stop coming, and they don't stop coming"
Superhot VR,Lagavulin? The super hottest scotch there is. Nice.
Superhot VR,The first VR game that actually got my interest
Superhot VR,So... a Matrix Simulator turned into an even better Matrix Simulator.
Superhot VR,The only VR game piques my interest so far.
Superhot VR,Nice Lagavulin shout out. Shit is delicious.
Superhot VR,this review is hilarious as sheeeit. Nice vid dude
Superhot VR,"So when's the Serious Sam VR review? The First and Second Encounter though, probably not Last Hope."
Superhot VR,Great video! Thanks for being awesome.
Superhot VR,"The original game is super overrated. This version seems to be better, if nothing else because your hitbox is smaller and  the weapons now fly towards you, instead of a random direction like the prequel."
Superhot VR,Are you going to review Arizona Sunshine?
Superhot VR,"just watching VR gameplay makes me feel motion sick, hate to think what it feels like actually using one, I really want to try one though but im poor :("
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Something tell’s me GmanLives hates Pewdiepie, Yamimash, Jacksepticeye and Markiplier."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,I played alien isolation which I absolutely loved. Was recommended this game and currently about half way through the first. Awesome so far
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Replayed again recently....... Overhyped not at all scary overrated shite.... Unbelievable how much praise it gets... Sound design is good.... Erm yeah sheep fodder game
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"I've just finished it yesterday, and right now, sitting in a bright office, with people all around... hearing the sounds of Amnesia in this video almost gave me an anxiety attack.
10/10, brilliant game!"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"It actually has four enemy type 
Grunt brute kaernak and shadow"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Amnesia was the game that inspired me want a better computer.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Graphics straight out of 90's. Look at those not so round barrels etc made out of 8 polygons LOL.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,the scariest part for me when you got a low sanity and you look at that adult picture and its turns to Satan
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,the Reverb sound make the game the scariest game ever
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Frankly., if you do watch shithead 'let's play'-ers on You Tube you deserve to get amnesia spolt."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,The game actually reminds me of skyrim but you can’t kill the enemies :)
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"I got bored a few hours in, I think its a bit more scary than Penumbra but I found those games were a bit more entertaining for me, eventually ill get to play it again, SOMA is also on my list but I have a big backlog."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,The scariest game ever made
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Finally got the balls to beat this game.... holy shit was it horrifying. The things Daniel did goddamn
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Frictional games and amnesia suck ass. Who coded this game engine, some 15 years old intern who was making coffee on frictional games offices. In general frictional games, amnesia and game engine suck ass."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Ptsd fuel
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"I don't understand, like yeah the game is damn scary, i can attest, but so scary that you actually scream?....like, out loud? at most you'd go AH FUCK! out loud or panic and hit escape and gtfo but scream? why? ...How? seriously How do you do that? i don't get it."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Just got it for like 2.99 on xbox store and Soma.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"but the puzzles weren't that easy dude, for example, the elevator and the machine room, the prisons maze,  the cell, and the damn window that has to be shattered, I was frustrated until I found it!!"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Im 23 and my gf is 20, what are the chances were both scared shitless playing this in the dark sippin wine"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Just finished replaying the game yesterday. Good god, even now that I know every inch of the game like the back of my hand, it STILL manages to get me. That's how much of a masterpiece this horror game is. Eagerly looking forward to Amnesia: Rebirth."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"1:05. It IS called ""short term memory loss dark descent"", that's what amnesia is."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"This game would have been a lot better if the monster actually always existed, and hunted you down the entire game instead of just lamely popping up and despawning at certain points. Like had real AI and could not be predicted where it was or what it was doing."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"This is an eternal classic game, I always went back into the game and fucked around with the monster, yes monster not monster's, you DO encounter two others but they are level specific, and the point he didn't touch on was how fantastic they set the game up, what I mean is that they hold your hand just long enough for you to fully get how to deal with the game so it isn't too difficult or confusing too fast, and the game is BIG also, tons of areas where you're scarily creeping around balancing sanity and your OWN sanity by carefully looking around and marking potential hiding spots, there isn't a huge replay factor but you can have your own fun messing around, plus there are different story endings but they don't require you to start the whole game over which is nice, the biggest point he missed is that anybody whose a gamer can play this, it can be done by anybody similar to mario64 it has hard spots but not frustrating parts which is a huge difference :) don't forget to sit your girlfriend down and have her play too, and your mom and sisters and all other friends because you really get sucked into it so you can watch their actions it can be pretty funny, never give them too many clues! <3"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,amnesia will prove that jumpscares are the  shitiest method to scare the player and a game can be scary as hell wtihout jumpscares.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,I really wish this game scared me as it did to others =\
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,This game is free on epic games right now
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTtT47QQ-8M&t=361s
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"I'm having performance issues... my gpu is at 50% on the highest core and my gpu is a gtx 1060 6gb, overclocked. I don't know how to fix it. Anybody has had such a problem?"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,You have same voice as Jarrod's tech and other Australian YouTubers
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Fun Fact: American McGee was one of the designers for this game, Quake 1 and 2, Doom 1 and 2, and was the creator for the Alice and the Grimm series."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"""A horribly depressing and dark gameworld where you uncover this sinister and cruel backstory while you become more and more immersed in your surroundings""
Umm this is a pretty good description of my life actually..."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Still one of the best first person horror game. This, Outlast, Alien Isolation and Fear"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"There's only one part that got me so bad, I started laughing. It's a part many have experienced, where you're in the prison, and you hear the monster, and you get scared and try to hide in one of the cells. You open the door, enter, close it behind you, just to find out the monster was in the same cell which you just entered the entire time. Lol. 😅"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Thought: You should play one of these scary games with your gf while she makes fun of you for being a 6 foot man-child XD
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"This game looks pretty awesome
However, that bright, pale light when you've discovered something or executed an action is pretty annoying, especially if I'm going to play in a dark room."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"I hate theze type of games where your a complete cowered who doesnt try and defend themselves, when i would bludgeon everything that made a peep"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Just replayed the game and IMO there is no other horror game that compares to Amnesia TDD it is so much like being trapped in a nightmare you just feel so exposed and vulnerable. Nothing examplifies this as the choir main hall for some  reason my graphics were off and more blurry and I could not see anything and I had to navigate by sound. Also this area the mechanics are different the monster does not despawn it patrols until you pass it like in the sewer. Not many horror movies or games gets to me these days but running around in that area not seeing anything just hearing those groans..........It got to me !!! A masterpiece
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"I always loved this game, when i was younger i watched pewdiepie play this (custom stories)"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,The most hard part for me to complete was the Prision Stage Damn i get lost Like 9 times in that part.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,The most hard part for me to complete was the Prision Stage Damn i get lost Like 9 times in that part.

Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"There's actually 2 enemy types if we don't include the Kaernk (That water fucker).  The Gatherer types are the Grunts (the weirdos with the fucked up mouth that can twoshot you) and the Brutes (the fuckers that have their head split down the center and instead of a claw they attack you with a blade, these can easily oneshot you if they get a crit on you)."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Daniel's voice actor was my chemistry teacher in highschool.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"This is my favorite horror game to date. It's creepy and eerie thanks to the sounds and lighting. It has some jump scares but doesn't rely on them, making it a good horror experience."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Shit head let’s players 
XD XD
Savage truths spoken"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"I heard of this a game a few times but was never really interested. But yesterday I saw it on sale so I was like eh I’ll try it out, so far I’ve played only about an hour of it (I’m at the part right before you go to the wine cellar, no spoilers please I know next to nothing about the game because I didn’t watch any of those keys plays) but so far it’s pretty amazing, I’m loving it"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Thx bro for doing a review of a game that people watch before they play the game and you include important story details. Nothing wrong here.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"just finished it and i'm rather disappointed. it is not a bad game, actually the first half of the game is very well made. but it is not scarier than any other horror game i played so far. and the second half of the game just drags. i got the impression that the focus of the game shifted from actually trying to scare you to just solving some way to cryptic puzzles and lame annoying fetch quests. You spend the last four or five hours of the game just running around like an idiot, looking for the little item or switch you missed and it just can't maintain a scary atmosphere because of that. Unfortunately the atmosphere is the only thing that this game has really going for it, because the gameplay mechanics are really simple and when you do encounter enemies, the stealth system is way to shallow to be exciting.

i have to say i found games like F.E.A.R., Dead Space or System Shock 2 much more creepy. It's not that they were actually scarier than this, but overall they managed to maintain a much more unsettling atmosphere than Amnesia in my opinion.

Many people say that A Machine for Pigs is inferior to the Dark Descent. I liked AMFP much more than TDD, because it has less and easier puzzles, no annoying superficial inventory management and is much shorter and streamlined, so you can actually focus on the atmosphere the whole game through. Further, that game is really creepy and disturbing at times. Its plot is ten times more interesting than that of TDD, and it relies more on the „subconcious“ psychological horror, in contrast to TDD which has that classic „frankenstein dracula monster movie vibe“ to it. so in comparison, AMFP is much more effective as a horror game. and on top, it has better voice acting too."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Does anyone hear “amnesier” every time he says amnesia?
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,I strongly believe that this is the best horror game ever created. No contest.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Just tried this in cinematic mode on my PSVR... One of the scariest things I've ever done.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Gorgeous at TOYMS
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,don't you just hate it when popular youtubers tend to ruin a game experience before playing it.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Where's that song in the intro from?
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Actually Amnesia has 4 types of enemies, 3 of which function the same anyways, also when your sanity is low, Daniel (the player) starts saying things which makes it easier for enemies to find you."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,The sound effects in this game=porn lol!!!
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Glad they got rid of the combat in this one. Penumbra is great, Amnesia is  un-believably good."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"This game is worth playing because of its legacy as well as it’s overall quality. It pretty much launched the Let’s Play genre into the mainstream by propelling PewDiePie’s career as a YouTuber. Being a retarded pewdiepie worshipping 11 year old at the time I remember my first time playing amnesia and how scared I was to enter the next room. I never got around to finishing the main story until maybe 2014, until then I played and even tried to create custom stories. I’m actually still waiting on the release of a custom story I’ve been following for years called “The Hands resist Him”, probably not coming out tho, which is a shame since it was really far into development and looked amazing."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,A speedrun of this takes about 2 hours.  Maybe less depending on the ballsy level of the player.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"""Like an absolute bitch... Like an Absolute Bitch sunny Jim!"", Laughs, Likes and subscribes."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"...Like an absolute bitch, sonny jim!"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Instead of making me want to play amnesia again I now want to play call of cthulhu again lol
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Apparently this game is supposed to be scary but It doesn’t scare me, that’s not me trying to sound tough or something but the ai was really easy to mess with. If you don’t want to know how stop reading because this ruined the game for me. Just wait, or throw yourself at the monster and get yourself killed once, they will disappear after that because of what I presume to be a bug. But the game was incredibly atmospheric and I loved it regardless, the best part for me was the last third of the game."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Admittedly, I should've shied away from any videos of this masterpiece on YouTube. I did enjoy watching people playing the game, but it ended up spoiling the experience. Plus, all that information on the Amnesia Wiki (while helpfully informative) also helped to spoil the experience. That's all my fault, however. I still ended up thoroughly enjoying my 11 playthroughs of this game, and it actually managed to give me nightmares. On my latest playthrough, it actually took me _two weeks_ to gain up the courage to replay the ""Choir: Main Hall"" area. Those 8-or-so Servant Brutes were genuinely terrifying to me."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,That was an excellent game but honestly it kind of stopped being scary about a third through the game once you learned all its gimmicks.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"There are actually two different enemy types not counting the water monster.  The sewn up cadavers mentioned in the video are Grunts, but there are also Brutes.  Brutes are more ominous sounding, and you can hear them dragging their metal arm across the ground when they're searching for you."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Who raised the gamma to max?
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Just got the Amnesia collection (3 games) on PS4 for free! These games are free until next month on the playstation store. 30$ value for free. Awesome.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Great review. Great game.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,awesome video! still watching it in 2017 =) found this one btw https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-7m2_8TJcQ which i thought was copied from you .
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"I didn't enjoy this game and it became soon a frustrating ride. The many irritating elements are for example the maze like maps, the backtracking, the difficult puzzles (e.g. totally oversaw a hatch in the roof; steam engine which needs the broken unmarked pipes on the ground) and the wandering monster. The oil lamb is a nice gimmick but limits the exploration. In the end it was not worth my time and money. The same company also made SOMA which I loved, probably because it's less horror, direction and puzzles are more clear and it has a fantastic story."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Oh dear my name is Daniel
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Would you kindly not use God's Name in vain in your videos? It's sinful and offensive. Thank you.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Too bad another game hasn't been able to recapture this type of horror besides P.T.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Where's that music in the intro from?
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"I love alien isolation, outlast and slender the arrival, dead space, stalker, half life, but i can't say the same for Amnesia ggmanlives sorry to say but this isn't as scary as some players say.
Too much poltergeist stuff happends in the early game, and im not a big fan of puzzles.
I got till the invisible monster at water level where you can't stay in water too long.

I made it at the last door only to see that the damn door needs a key to unlock, nearly dead no health potions im done with this game, not even once i was scared in this game. 
The sanity thing sounds good on paper but in gameplay it sucks you need to say in light for a few minutes to regain it, and that just brakes the game for me.

I know im not far in the game but if jumpscares are the only scarry part of the game then count me out ,there are other horror games like dead space that uses jump scares but at least it has a decent story and lots of gameplay mechanics.
Outlast is better in every way ,the comparison is fair cus outlast too is a idie develper.
Its more scary, more fun to play, better story, better graphics.

I really wanted to like Amnesia Dark Decent, but when you finish a long puzzle and the final door requires a key to unlock with not much life left and a monster that kills you in 2-3 hits when life is full, its just more annoying that ever.
It fails to introduce that walking corpse the first time it appear it was so short i couln't see what the hell it looks like ,barely seen him a few seconds then it disappeared.

Very disappointed for ""the scariest game ever made"""
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"I love how you say shit.

SHIEET.

someone make a compilation of it."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"thief the metal age is scary

amnesia i feel was a let down,"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"SUCH a fucking awesome review compared to every other one currently on youtube. Bravo! Although I kind of wish I didn't know the iron maiden was gonna suddenly open, cause I don't think it added a lot to the video and it took away (a little) from the gameplay."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Dogman lives? Oh no!
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Good Review! This and Machine for Pigs is being released on PS4 now, so its nice to get an opinion on the game!"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Eternal Darkness had the best sanity/Insanity effects. It made you lose your mind for real.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"""imagine her response when she realized it was a 6 foot tall manchild screaming at a videogame."""
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Too bad Amnesia inadvertently caused the thing I hate the most in this world.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"like an absolute bitch"""
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Amnesia sucks ass,though.
You should play the penumbra series."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Best horror game I have played 10/10
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"This game is overhyped and overrated. It's crazy that such a piece of mediocrity is hyped so fucking much til this very day. Amnesia is like Thief Deadly shadows without everything good. Story is kindergarten-level simple, there are no characters, barely any gameplay, levels are linear and small, zero replay value, and no music. Fuck frictional games and fuck their half-assed copy-paste oh so scary walking sim games"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"I played this game because a friend of mine wanted to watch it but was too afraid to play it.
I remember this one time that the monster showed at the top of a stair case and Instead of being quiet and calm I paniced and started running thinking I could find a door to shut in front of it or something.
Here was the kicker: I never saw the monster up close before because I was always diligent at hiding, so when I finally turned around while (in my mind, knowing how good I was at multiplayer shooters) changing to running backwards, all I saw was a deformed creature eating my face.

We both screamed quite loud.
My Ex-GF could never handle horror well. If she ever wants me back, Ill tell her ok if she can finish Amnesia, on a single sit, on VR :D.

Btw, Tried outlast?"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Damn, I really wish I had discovered your channel earlier.  Your reviews really are top-notch."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"will you review Silent Hill 2? (aka one of the best horror games ever)
or at least, SOMA (also by Frictional games)"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Wo Daniel!
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"loved this game, but did not finish it :)"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"The best ingredient for a horror game is paranoia and Amnesia constantly feeds you that stuff. It creeps you out from the inside and builds upon that fear of the unknown, remember paranoia is key to longevity."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,fuck what people say this game is childhood. best horror game
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Yeah, I really can't stand those shit headed Let's Players on youtube, annoying as hell. Not because it's utterly pointless, unoriginal and total spoiler fest but because they flood youtube with their crappy videos and you have to sift through all that crap when you're searching for a real review..."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,you have to review Eternal Darkness for the gamecube!!!
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"What do you think about the sequel, A machine for Pigs. To me it was a disappointment..."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"The entire time while I was playing this game, I got a familiar feeling that reminded me of Bioshock for some reason. Something about the art design just reminds me of rapture."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,I no like scare-wee games
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"I thought the grunt was a horrifying creature, as it used to be  person but that is what Alexander turned them into."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"This was the first horror game I ever played. I thought the monster designs were creepy because I had never seen anything like them before. Btw, they aren’t just zombies, they are actually alive. If you listen closely to the sounds the Grunt makes when he hears you, it kinda sounds like he’s saying things like “What?” “Who’s there?” and “Where you at?” And the backstory of the Grunts and Brutes is pretty f***ed up and unsettling because they were normal humans before Alexander changed them to what you see them as in the game."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,What kind of a psychopath plays any game without headphones
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,I love this game. A masterpiece in its own right.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"glad  someone play xb ver, wait for rebirth"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Nice intro
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,I like amnesia
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Ah yes, a horribly disfigured and mutilated person shambling about searching for SOMETHING to kill, who finds you and chases you, moving faster than you can and with no hope to reason with it and can easily overpowerer you, is 'derpy' and 'not scary'. Just like The Joker, a deranged terrorist who has murdered people plunged an entire city into chaos, is not the least bit scary because he wears clown makeup and calls himself 'Joker'.

Deciding something 'isn't scary' because you think it looks silly is honestly a pretty stupid thought process. Who cares how it looks if it can tear you limb from limb and has every intention to do so? I think hippopotami look pretty derpy, doesn't make the thought of being attacked by one any less scary."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"I think that the intentional vaugeness is a result of the games Lovecraftian angle. It's the ""fear the unknown and some things you can't truly comprehend or they would drive you mad"" thing."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,i thought the monster was pretty horrific haha
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Great video Jirard. If you enjoyed Amnesia then I highly recommend SOMA. It's made by the same dev's and I'm not really sure why but for some reason it sort of went completely under the radar. Where Amnesia blew up and became a huge trend on Youtube, SOMA went mainly unnoticed. Yet, when comparing the two, I would say SOMA is the best game they ever made. 

Amnesia is probably the scariest, but SOMA's story, immersion and setting is unbelievably good. You should definitely give it a try."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,I liked this video 1:23 seconds in. Love the intro hahahaha! What a classic!
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Isn't it funny that Amnesia is an unforgettable game?
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"3 endings, not enough research done."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"I thought they were about to sit down around the fire and say ""I'm very proud of this community."""
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"So, this was the video I watched just as YouTube deleted the thumbs down button"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,i loved the are u afraid of the dark feeling
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Bro that intro was so fucking genius, had me dying when you said “may I?”"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"I liked my time with this game, I played a little of it and was kinda engrossed in the scares and the story but man... the ""insanity"" effects and the motion blur really made it hard to continue and I had to put it down. I have some bad motion sickness and whatever this game is doing triggers it something awful and made a little barfy. That and the samey environments meant me spending more time in the dark with more intense effects and yeah I had to put it down for good. Nothing against the game, it's a solid 4/5 and I respect what it's doing/done for horror gaming, I'm just old and my eyes suck lol."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Great video. I just I installed Amnesia myself. Got all three games to play through October. 

Also, what is that game at 2:15 ?"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,the Reverb sound make the game the scariest game ever
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Bonus points for who got the ""are you afraid of the dark"" reference."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"was this game by any means inspired by theresia from nds?
I mean, the premise is similar."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,In the flooded cellar chase I used two boxes to swim boat-ride on by
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"I agree with Jirard on the design of Grunt, he is definitely the derpiest derp that has ever derped."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"I'm genuinely impressed you completed Amnesia the Dark Descent, a game that I've been too terrified to finish, I raise a glass in your honor!"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Ah man, you gotta love all those crumbling stone rooms."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Homeboy sounds like the male child from fallout three, I cannot get the image of squirrel out of my head when he was talking"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"I really gotta finish amnesia, I made myself a promise that I'd play it all the way through because, FUN FACT, I've never beaten a horror game before.


And I call myself a gamer."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Thank you for the laughs good video
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"YES! I couldn't watch the thing for years but I did and now this water monster is here, I'm done XD"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,lmfao anyone else get are you afraid of the dark vibes from the intro? nice homage imo
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,I wanna see jirard fight that kid
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Good video but you forgot this is a indie game with no resources to polish it.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,I think I hurt a little inside when he dissed the designs for the gatherers. I thought they were some of the coolest looking monsters ever when I first played amnesia.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"I offer to the *Midnight Society,* a tale of a handsome man, who spent his life wallowing in the darkest deepest pits of pixel hell. His large beard wasn't just a magnificent display of his facial hair, but also a reflection of his soul and how dark his hobby quickly became a rabid obsession. Time went on, and as he slowly lost his sanity...the murders began.
This is the *Tale of the Bearded Masochist .*"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Do Alice madness returns also little nightmares 2
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"21. Wine Cellar: Much like the refinery, it's dark and this is another sneak peek at the Gatherer enemy. The reason it's higher is because this is your first glimpse of one. I was expecting to see this thing at some point in the game and when I caught a glimpse of the creature, well, let's just say I no longer felt remotely comfortable exploring the rest of the place. Of course it actually despawns and then you're free to move about the cabin. Being this early in the game, I did not realize that.

22. Guest Room: The guest room subverted my expectations greatly. I quickly came to the conclusion that like the study, this small area was harmless. A little safe haven of sorts. It actually serves as an introduction to the Gatherer and a tutorial on how to hide from it. Granted, the game warns you and gives you time to hop in a cabinet and close the doors asap, but it was pretty frightening knowing that it was in the same room with me. I also wasn't sure if they could open cabinets. I will forever remember this room as the one that served up a false sense of security.

23. Sewers: The sewers are plenty well lit, thank God! Even so, there are quite a few baddies in this one area. They are also fairly well obscured by the natural mist in the air. On top of this, you have the end of this section where you pretty much have to run for it to get by the Brute. Not the scariest area in the game, but one with plenty of actual danger.

Areas That Are Deeply Disturbing And Scary:

24. Morgue: Besides being a generally unpleasant place to be, filled with dead bodies, this area is kind enough to have a monster waiting in your path when you go to leave. The area is small and doesn't feature any good places to hide. At least parts of it are not as dark as it could be, unlike some other areas still to come...

25. Transept: The transept has no enemies, even though I was expecting them. However, what you do get is a deep understanding of the true extent of Alexander's evil and what a horrible monster Daniel actually is. Torturing and murdering people to save himself? Sorry bud, there's no redemption in the hell you're headed for! By this point, the game was getting grizzly. Sure, you never actually see any gore per se, but hearing the cries of the victims, along with vivid descriptions of their individual experiences is nothing short of disturbing. Seeing the torture devices and the imaginitive ways to kill a person is just sickening. Sad thing is, most, if not all of these methods have been used in the past by real people. I lost a chunk of my faith in humanity exploring this horrid place. I do like that spiral staircase though.

26. Choir: My feelings towards the choir are much the same as with the transept. More disgusting methods of torture. This ranks slightly higher though because it also has the threat of multiple monsters lurking around. The area is wide open though, and as creepy as the red fog looks, it's also bright enough that you don't have to use your lantern. This makes it much harder for enemies to spot you. Still, it's definitely a foreboding place you don't want to explore, but must.

27. Storage: I was surprised at the pacing of the game in terms of unleashing it's main threat upon me, the player. By this point I'd had a few brief glimpses of the Gatherers, but the game really takes it's time before forcing you to have to contend with one. That all changes in the storage! The first thing I immediately noticed was just how much darker everything was. The laboratory and wine cellar, hell even the refinery were dark. Not like the storage...pitch black. I sensed upon entering that this would be my first real encounter with a Gatherer. Sure enough, I get a glimpse of one. Then it seemingly despawns into oblivion and I think to myself that might be the last I see of it. Ya know, like in the earlier areas. The game sent me into a small panic when I went to leave and had one of those damn things blocking my exit. It got my heart racing pretty good as I bolted in the opposite direction, entered a room, closed the door and hid behind a few barrels. Next thing I know, the door gets broken down. Then I had the joy of trying to sneak out of there. The storage is the first real taste of terror in this game.

28. Prison (Northern Block): Though both sections of the prison are pretty equally terrifying, I'm putting the second section lower simply based on the fact that it's more of what I've already been introduced to in the first section of the prison. For the list, I'm pretty much counting both sections as one area.

29. Prison (Southern Block): Without a doubt the most terrifying part of the game. Carefully reserved for the game's mid point, the prison is horrible. I could barely bring myself to go in as I approached this jet black hall filled with the harrowing cries of it's empty cells. The place is as dark as the game gets and features multiple Gatherers. The layout is confusing and labyrinthine. I got lost over and over while trying to figure out what to do. There is a shortage of good hiding spots. I even went through the trouble of lighting many of the torches in the area and when I thought I was going to finally be able to navigate the maze, guess what...a gust of wind suddenly blows through and turns out all the lights! I'm back in pure pitch black...again. This was easily the most uncomfortable area of the game for me to traverse and I couldn't get out fast enough!"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"11. Entrance Hall: The first hub area. It didn't take long to realize this served as a connecting hub and would therefore be devoid of any real danger. Still, this is very early in the game and I was on edge with what to expect.  Some of the corruption and sanity effects that would occur between areas of this hub were pretty jarring this early on.

12. Chancel: This place just seemed interesting and cool rather than scary. Still, it had a couple of surprise moments including when you get taken by a gang of gatherers and an appearence of one just before going through the portal.

13. Study: I feel like in retrospect the Study is one of my favorite areas of the game. Hopping across ledges and getting a good look at the outside was great. I hung around long enough to get the sense that this was an enemy free zone, which it is. Still, it had more subtle ways of inflicting unease. The notes about Alexander's experiments chopping up doggies and getting to see the remnants of that...was fairly disturbing. Plus there is always sanity effects. It was weird to suddenly see a group of butchered pig bodies hanging from hooks that weren't there a moment ago. My eyes had to do a double take.

14. Laboratory: This place is dark. It was the first area in the game I explored that was this dark. I kept expecting something...but no, it's just dark.

15. Nave: It's dark and yes, Agrippa's husk is creepy, but the area acts as the final hub of the game and is therefore, safe from monsters. Thing is, it doesn't have that same welcoming presence the other hubs have, and so I didn't know it was one. The atmosphere is not inviting and I fully expected more Gatherers to appear at any moment as I explored. For this reason, the nave ranks as high as it does.

Areas That Are Kinda Scary:

16. Cellar Archives: The kaern (I know I just mispelled that) wasn't really scary to me. It was, however, a viable threat. One I died to several times before learning what I could and couldn't get away with. More of a challenge than anything actually scary. Still, it was the first actual threat that I had to face to progress.

17. Cells: The cell area itself is completely safe, so long as you don't linger for an eternity. The only part that's at all scary is when the Shadow chases you through that long corridor. Still, it's a simple matter of just running straight to the end. Not that terrifying.

18. Archive Tunnels: Another keep running scenario. This time around though you need to actually turn and shut the doors behind you.

19. Archives: This is another very early location. I remember the sanity effects getting bumped up at this point. A jump scare involving a gust of wind, or maybe a door suddenly opening. Stuff like that. The moment I mostly remember from this area, however, occurs as you're leaving and hear the distinct, loud groan of a nearby monster. Turns out there isn't actually anything there (I don't think), but that didn't stop me from running and hiding!

20. Refinery: The area is dark and you get a glimpse of a gatherer. It's uncomfortable to be sure, but as long as you stay out of sight it will despawn, leaving only the darkness to contend with."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"I just finished Amnesia: The Dark Descent only a couple of hours ago for the first time and I gotta say, it's pretty terrifying overall. Here are each of the areas of Castle Brennenburg ranked from least to most terrifying. I will be judging based on a combination of actual threats and scares found in a particular section combined with my thoughts and perceptions upon reaching each new area. SPOILERS AHEAD!!! Here's my list: 


Areas That Are Not Scary At All:

01. Choir Entrance: Literally a short hallway with no threats of any kind.

02. Orb Chamber: Since this game has no combat, I knew Alexander would not be a threat and finally faced him with absolutely no sense of dread.

03. Cistern Entrance: A safe hub world with overhead light that was a welcome respite from the previous area.

04. Control Room: I figured out pretty quickly that this was much like the earlier machine area and an enemy free zone. There's enough natural lighting, even if it's a bit dim, to see what you're doing, allowing you to spare resources.

05. Machine Room: I walked into this area with a slight sense of unease but after lingering for a while trying to solve it's puzzles, I realized it was totally safe. It's fairly lit up as well.


Areas That Could Be Scary:

06. Inner Sanctum - This barely counts. I am nearing the end of the game and I can tell I'm moments from Alexander. The possibility existed that the game might try to throw a final scare my way, but it turned out not to be the case.

07. Cistern: The only thing that really concerned me at all was the possibility that I might run into one of those invisible water creatures. In spite of all the water, not one appeared.

08. Back Hall: A lovely safe haven with calming music and a good sense of overall ambience. The only things keeping this from being further down the list is the corruption effects once you get the elevator working, as well as that creepy ass fountain.

09. Rainy Hall: When I started up the game I knew it was only a matter of time before some crazy stuff came my way.  Then again, I was also fairly certain it wouldn't happen at the beginning of the game. Still, on a first playthrough, getting used to the sanity effects and warping walls is enough to provide a sense of insecurity. I love how when you find the note to yourself asking you to kill Alexander, so many thoughts flood your head about why you would do such an atrocious thing. Eventually, However, you learn all about mister Alexander and realize just how much he deserves to die!

10. Old Archives: This second area of the game gets a slight leg up over it's preceding area on the fact that I was expecting some shit at some point, and this was the next area that might have it."

Amnesia: The Dark Descent,you forgot the 4th ending
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Great video! I only played the story once and I almost beat it a second but prison is awful for me. I get scared very easily
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Yes yes yes! Finally someone agreeing that this game is not that great. If only people could start seeing that about Xenoblade Chronicles. Unimpressed.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,This guy goes so deep into everything. It makes the reviews better.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Which is scarier - Amnesia or Outlast?
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,she said the thing!
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,I loved this game haven't seen it for a while
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Scary Games to Play in the Dark
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Okay real talk the skit elements of this video really reminded me of 4-5 years ago when I first found your channel Jirard. The creativity, funny ass content of it; and all still being relevant to the game you're commenting on? Brilliant work again my man."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Why is Old Man Jirard hanging out with the kids so damn funny? 😂
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Such a fun game to beat. Completing it seems like a stressful hell. It’s a really good game but I think you guys need to start enjoying your games!!!! Completing them is so so boring.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,What was the game at 2:15 please help
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Play Terraria
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,The opener reminds me of when I try talking video games with my middle school students XD
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,It would be cool if you did Hollow Knight
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Great review. Also would've enjoyed more interesting cutscenes. Shame they didn't have the funding for it.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"That opening, omg.  Contender for best Completionist Halloween video."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Forgettable horror. Arguably the most boring game I've played in the past 30 years...
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Sorry i just came here for him to roast him 🤣😂
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,O nice video
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Just a ""did you know"", but that water monster is just a plain textureless ball with opacity set to 0, so yeah, we were all afraid of a seethrough jumping balloon :p"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,rdr2 pls 😁
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,15: 33 I laughed so hard at that. XD
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Came here for the meeting of the midnight society. Stayed because, ""Scawey!"""
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"I live for the day when you will complete Star Ocean 4 The Last Hope on the 360, I don't know a single person who ever made it"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Can you please complete obey me one master to rule them all with wolfychu, seikyuu and robin form anime American? 💗😇🌸"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"So even though it's not an excuse, Amnesia was an indie game, which is part of its character, it lacks in certain elements but it's still an incredible underdog story. The creators ran out of money multiple times but pulled it together by the end.

Also, the loading screen flavour-text and real life characters isn't pointless, it's worldbuilding, giving more to Daniel's existence outside of what we see. The game also focuses on real-life history, politics and geography all the time, adding a few real characters just helps with that. Sure it doesn't add a massive amount, but it doesn't take anything away.

Lastly; Ignoring the fact you skipped over another creature design, a much freakier one at that. I think the monsters look great, them being mutilated, grotesque figures really adds mystery as to their existence. It also helps add to the supernatural elements of the game. They're not just humans, and they're not just monsters, they're humanoid ""things"", they could've been human once, but were somehow transformed. THAT is scary to me."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Jirad you should complete Costume quest and costume quest 2
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Thats odd... i would have thought that you completed the witcher 3... huh...
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Complete Lost In Vivo
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,*”wut da dizile”*
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,#goozy
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,This review is Huge Plays
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Submitted for the approval of the Midnight Society, I call this story, ⁕throws powder⁕ 🔥 , “The Tale... of the Amnesiac Resurrection”"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,that's wiggity wiggity wack
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,can you do left 4 dead 2 last stand
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,It’s been several years Jirard. I am still waiting for that Jak 3 video. Please.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,If I had a request than my requested is that the the completionist must completed and conquer  soul sacrifices for ps vita it a fan request
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Loved this episode man and thank for honestly critiquing it. The live action bits were very fun and entertaining to watch :D
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Tossing the Gfuel on the fire was funnier than it had any right to be, now to watch the episode lol"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Okay I admit it, I laughed WAY too hard at ""Shut up, kid! YOU'RE old!"""
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Jirard would be that grandfather who goes off on disrespectful kids. That campfire scene was just golden. 

“Shut up kid!YOU’RE old!”"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,But beardman...
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"@Jirard, Idk if you play large open works games but I have a game recommendation. Cyberpunk 2077. I think it’ll be a long project but I would love to see that game be completed."
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,I loved this skit XD
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Carrion is short but it would still be cool to see a mini episode on it
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Is the water monster a fish? I always interpreted the splashing as its footsteps
Hyper Light Drifter,When you come back after realising they created an entirely new language which has been deciphered and translated.
Hyper Light Drifter,"Hyper Light Drifter is a perfect example of ""Show, don't tell"""
Hyper Light Drifter,IGN be consistent on what they do and dont like for 2 seconds challenge (impossible)
Hyper Light Drifter,Hyper light goes 3D with 2023 hyper light breaker so cool
Hyper Light Drifter,This game is an abstract story telling game. That's the whole point...
Hyper Light Drifter,what was so confusing about the story? world has got this corruption taking over the world and our main characters mind and by defeating the 4 evil sages he achieves a cleansing
Hyper Light Drifter,"lol it says a lot about our MCU canonized culture when a story that is up for interpretation and makes you think you own thoughts is seen as a drawback. 

It's poetic."
Hyper Light Drifter,Jesus Christ loves you so much so love him
Hyper Light Drifter,This review sounds like he doesnt even like playing video games with these back hand takes
Hyper Light Drifter,For me its a 9.5.
Hyper Light Drifter,"For any lone time traveler looking for the title of the music track in the background, it's ""Silver and Gold"" by Wally Gagel & Xandy Barry. The authors of this reviews didn't even credit them."
Hyper Light Drifter,"Thumbs down on this one. Inaccurate review and, though an option, an opinion on the wrong side of history."
Hyper Light Drifter,"When IGN says 'should' negatively, you know the game is amazing"
Hyper Light Drifter,Has music like moonlighter
Hyper Light Drifter,This game is darksoulbornevania meets limbozelda clone
Hyper Light Drifter,Every single game is a masterpiece according to the comments of game reviews 🙄
Hyper Light Drifter,Lazy story telling.
Hyper Light Drifter,"Im surprised the gameplay isn't a con, because it absolutely blows imo"
Hyper Light Drifter,Light Drifter look my channel name😐
Hyper Light Drifter,"One of the reasons why dislikes should be back. Pretty awful review, game was a solid 9/10 in my book. The story is up to interpolation, and if you really want to know what it is, you can do research. Imagine somebody taking points of Hollow Knight because they couldn't understand the story."
Hyper Light Drifter,This is proof that you people HATE indie games
Hyper Light Drifter,What is the point of giving something a 7.6 lmao
Hyper Light Drifter,This is the most ridiculous “review” This guy needs games to hold his hand
Hyper Light Drifter,This review is journalistic malpractice
Hyper Light Drifter,7.6? Really???? Anyone else feel like giving a game a 7.6 is a hilarious figure? Just give it the 8.
Hyper Light Drifter,Yeah you one of those huh. 7/10 because you had to think lmao
Hyper Light Drifter,Imagine not understanding how abstract can make something better? LOL
Hyper Light Drifter,7.6 omegalul
Hyper Light Drifter,My man gave Twin Peaks s3 a 2/5 Letterboxd review because he had to make up a theory
Hyper Light Drifter,"are the dislikes the people who hate the game or the people that are pissed that he used ""abstract storytelling"" as a con?"
Hyper Light Drifter,7.6/10 It ain't Call of Duty
Hyper Light Drifter,"“Need to think to understand the story”? Bro... we are the ones who need to think, to understand IGN reviews nowadays xD"
Hyper Light Drifter,Another clueless IGN review. Thanks for nothing.
Hyper Light Drifter,Creator of the game has heart disease and is supposed to depict his struggles with dealing with the disease and mortality
Hyper Light Drifter,"""Don't make me use my brain....""
- IGN"
Hyper Light Drifter,"""7.6/10 not a glorified cutscene simulator"""
Hyper Light Drifter,this game is underrated
Hyper Light Drifter,You can just tell it was Disasterpeace who did the OST.
Hyper Light Drifter,Please ignore this review and go buy the game this second. I can guarantee you that you will not regret it.
Hyper Light Drifter,What a joke.
Hyper Light Drifter,Can this reviewer please share which games he would award a 9 or 10?
Hyper Light Drifter,"""It was a great game but I no understand it""

-IGN"
Hyper Light Drifter,"One of my favorite games I’ve ever played, beautiful world and soundtrack, simple combat system, some bosses were challenging in my play through. The creator of this game has a heart condition, they have a vice episode on him and this game, overall makes the game sort of melancholy but also beautiful - I’m happy he made this game and that he got to see it completed."
Hyper Light Drifter,abstract storytelling is a negative lmfao IGN and its dumb staff are a joke.
Hyper Light Drifter,Perhaps IGN should choose appropriate game critics to review games of a specific genre and style. That way the score will be an accurate reflection of the games true value.
Hyper Light Drifter,"wow man, made my life...
nice one, subscribed...keep'em comin..."
Hyper Light Drifter,i LOVE the exploration!
Hyper Light Drifter,"Whenever I get bummed out about You guys, I go back to the original ‘Skate’ review"
Hyper Light Drifter,You know what other games use abstract storytelling? The entire Soulsborne series. And most of those games were given nines by IGN :/
Hyper Light Drifter,IGN has a way of really dumping on games you want to like
Hyper Light Drifter,darksouls before darksouls
Hyper Light Drifter,What son is playing in the background? I like!
Hyper Light Drifter,Hides too many pieces of important story details?  Dude are you dumb?
Hyper Light Drifter,Abstract storytelling a con? someone really needs to stop being a critic right away
Hyper Light Drifter,2D furi?
Hyper Light Drifter,Ign being awful example 10047923th
Hyper Light Drifter,Of course IGN reviewers aren’t smart enough to understand anything without it being spelled out for them
Hyper Light Drifter,Why'd they let a this cupcake review this game? 😒
Hyper Light Drifter,what is the name of the music at 0:28
Hyper Light Drifter,"“I’ve never played a metroidvania 7.6/10”
-IGN"
Hyper Light Drifter,what a garbage review.
Hyper Light Drifter,"Considering this was developed by a guy who was literally dying of a heart disease and wanted to complete it before he passed on, I'd give it a ten out of ten. Sorry it made your brain hurt because it had no words."
Hyper Light Drifter,"Oh, so because you didn't want to use your imagination to think about why some things might be, suddenly it's not a great game? I think you must really like basic hand holding stuff."
Hyper Light Drifter,"Is this game a roguelike, similar to gungeon or is it  just one adventure?"
Hyper Light Drifter,"watch guys, when elden ring comes out, those exact cons here are going to be pros in their elden ring's review this year"
Hyper Light Drifter,What a ridiculous review. I rate this review 4.5/10
Hyper Light Drifter,What a sad excuse for a review.
Hyper Light Drifter,I betcha 100% they’d be complaining about the story holding your hand
Hyper Light Drifter,"i love how IGN calls ""abstract storytelling"" a flaw but they actually let A PLAGARIZED DEAD CELLS REVIEW SLIDE FOR A WEEK!!"
Hyper Light Drifter,Hyper light blaster (enter the gungeon)
Hyper Light Drifter,Who else came here because it's free?
Hyper Light Drifter,Epic Games
Hyper Light Drifter,AND YOU CAN GET IT FREE ON EPIC LAUNCHER ON 27TH LOL
Hyper Light Drifter,It will be free tomorrow on epic games
Hyper Light Drifter,Have you tried using your brain?
Hyper Light Drifter,"just wow, ign. what an awful review.  highly regret watching this review"
Hyper Light Drifter,in what timeline is abstract storytelling a flaw
Hyper Light Drifter,This game speaks to the heart. Obviously the reviewer has no heart
Hyper Light Drifter,I came here to look at the comments rather than the actual video. They have the real review
Hyper Light Drifter,"Game too hard, too complex, me no like

7/10"
Hyper Light Drifter,A great game. Subpar review.
Hyper Light Drifter,7.6/10 “The game doesn’t play itself” - IGN
Hyper Light Drifter,Can anyone tell me the name of the background music that plays at around 0.27? I am in love with it
Hyper Light Drifter,Nope. This is nitpicking and biased. I win. Bye.
Hyper Light Drifter,I completely agree with this review. The exploration was so frustrating I put the game down after 3 hours.
Hyper Light Drifter,"It's free on epicgames right now, time to play this game XD"
Hyper Light Drifter,If you guys dont know right now you can download and play this game for free on the Epic Games Launcher. It will be free for this week only. I downloaded the game today and i love it!
Hyper Light Drifter,So you couldn't understand the story?.....wonderful review...stop playing computer games  and watch some cartoons.
Hyper Light Drifter,Where is Narita Boy??
Hyper Light Drifter,Game is at least an 8. WTF is with .4? lol
Hyper Light Drifter,lol I like how he like. Ugh.. Abstract not American thous thou not American.. OMG.. Who ever wrote this must have gotten tired of INDIE games lol... Abstract is made for a reason to make gamers come up with their own opinion guy..I am sorry you got to do a Mario 64 and discover places if you want to look as well.
Hyper Light Drifter,Haven't played this game yet but it looks like it could be a cool mobile game
Hyper Light Drifter,this game is free rn now on epic game launcher
Hyper Light Drifter,This went free on epic games just now
Hyper Light Drifter,"There're people who support IGN, can you believe it?"
Hyper Light Drifter,Why am i watching a IGN review?
Hyper Light Drifter,Talk about completely missing the point of the entire narrative. It's art-over-dialogue is designed to be interpretative. And you're here not being able to read between the lines. Sounds like a 9/10
Hyper Light Drifter,"terrible review the ""abstract storytelling"" used in the game is on purpose to let the player think and enjoy the game. It gets players wondering what has happened."
Hyper Light Drifter,The guy who made it has a heart problem that will eventually kill him but you didn't get the story....
Hyper Light Drifter,disliked before i even watched it :)
Hyper Light Drifter,Difficulty is lessened by forgiving save mechanics. If your stuck on a boss you don't need to beat the difficult section before him to fight him again. You get free retries
Hyper Light Drifter,"Hyper light drifter was to short. World to simple. Enemies and challenges start feeling very similar half way through 

Personally I don't like pixel art or the story presentation.

 Vastly prefer hollow knight. Looks better, characters with dialog and stories  you participate in. Hollownest is like 3 times the size of hpl world"
Hyper Light Drifter,Play Unsighted dude
Hyper Light Drifter,PLAYING THE GUITAR IS DIFFICULT FOR ME.
Hyper Light Drifter,10/10 review
Hyper Light Drifter,ive been inlove w this game since i played it at 2016-7 and man... i still go back
Hyper Light Drifter,"This game is a masterpiece. I'm currently playing through it and picking up on all of those minute details and the ways the story is told to the audience without saying anything at all. The use of imagery is both subtle and striking, and don't get me started on the music. My god it is brilliant."
Hyper Light Drifter,"it's beautiful aesthetically, both the music and the graphics/art, and the nonverbal communication and presentation is cool, but the gameplay is a bit repetitive after a while and the navigation of the dungeons can be a bit confusing in terms of knowing where you've been because so much of the areas look samey. the first playthrough is good but it's not a game i want to return to (i tried recently). i would have preferred some puzzles too--seems like zelda clones either do all action or all puzzles and rarely nail the right mix."
Hyper Light Drifter,This is how much you know about the lore at the very beginning of the game:
Hyper Light Drifter,Certainly my favorite game.
Hyper Light Drifter,I think I'm the only one who doesn't like this game lol
Hyper Light Drifter,That scene where the music picks up and you see the corpse of the giant robot on the mountainside. I had to pause my game and take a screenshot. That's been my phone background for years now. I didn't even realize it was about to become my all time favorite game yet.
Hyper Light Drifter,I'm sincerely grateful to Heart Machine for making it. Gave me such a good feeling.
Hyper Light Drifter,i like your jokes great entertaining video
Hyper Light Drifter,It made me so uncomfortable when you dropped your guitar
Hyper Light Drifter,"How am I only just now watching the best critique of my favourite game??
Stellar job, Matt. Thanks very much."
Hyper Light Drifter,This is one of my favourite videos ever about one of my favourite video games ever. Just... absolutely fantastic.
Hyper Light Drifter,One of my fav games of all time
Hyper Light Drifter,Very nice man. You got another subscriber. Your analysis is exactly right.
Hyper Light Drifter,Start making critiques on video games your voice is crazy good you’ll hit a milli subs in no time
Hyper Light Drifter,I miss your videos
Hyper Light Drifter,Nice video
Hyper Light Drifter,"People need to buy this game! GIVE THE DEVELOPER HEARTMACHINE YOUR MONEY, MORTALS!!!"
Hyper Light Drifter,"i've been saying HLD is my favorite game since about 2017. It still is. Absolutely a master-freaking-piece. in so, so, so, so many ways. I've replayed it about 7 or 8 times now and it's still almost overwhelming to sink my teeth into. I've done all the achievements, the switch dlc, all that stuff, and I still feel like it's the best game i've played. It's my favorite."
Hyper Light Drifter,What about 800 dash challenge?
Hyper Light Drifter,The promo video for this game is a work art. Game is pretty good too
Hyper Light Drifter,What an incredible video Matt. Hats off to you. ♥️
Hyper Light Drifter,Cheers!
Hyper Light Drifter,"Have been thinking about playing this. It was free on the EGS a while back and looks interesting. Just finished Jotun and enjoyed it and felt this might be similar. Looks a little too Dark Souls for my taste. And yeah, I don’t care how you try to slice it, Dark Souls, while great in atmosphere, was not a good game. It was beatable so long as you don’t mind using a faq or doing the same thing over and over again just to ‘git gud’. I’d rather practice guitar thanks"
Hyper Light Drifter,"I am so glad that I didn't let this game slip by, I'm playing it now, its just incredible."
Hyper Light Drifter,"“You can do it in whatever order you fancy.”
South area: am I a joke to you?"
Hyper Light Drifter,my problem with this game isn't the difficulty it's knowing where the heck to go
Hyper Light Drifter,This game has the best video game soundtrack of all time and the visuals are fuckin beautiful. If I saw a really really good anime of this I would literally cry and feel so fulfilled.
Hyper Light Drifter,I’m in agreement.
Hyper Light Drifter,"I loved that there was good gushing over this game ... because that’s how much I loved it, too"
Hyper Light Drifter,"no game that has been out less than 5 years should even mention being the ""best ever"". fucking nerds and sensationalism. everything is the new best."
Hyper Light Drifter,"""... but the timing of this is.... impossible, but then it becomes less impossible until you can finally just... do it?""


I love that line so much. It explains why I love games like this so much. I fell in love with Hollow Knight for the same reason. I'm gonna need to play this..."
Hyper Light Drifter,"Replace ""hyper light drifter"" with ""hollow knight"" it aplies perfectly to it"
Hyper Light Drifter,"And here i am in 2019, wondering how i could sleep on this game. Totally missed it!"
Hyper Light Drifter,"Hyper Light Drifter is what i like to call my ""Depression game"", i usually play it whenever im feeling my lowest point of insignificance and hopelessness. The incredible soundtrack and colorful visuals combined with the sheer difficulty help remind me that even though there are times you struggle with making progress, you do find moments of piece and quiet before and after you make it through what seems like a daunting challenge"
Hyper Light Drifter,I want to play that game on Nintendo Switch. But is so hard to buy it. =(
Hyper Light Drifter,"""is playing the guitar difficult?"" *mildly discordant plucking* ""...no!""
I've seen this video countless times, and that joke makes me laugh every time"
Hyper Light Drifter,I thought dark souls was actually pretty easy because I went in with every boss fight calm and collective and just wrecked the only struggle I had was Sen's fortress which is a B.S area but great game had fun but I had a harder time with DS3
Hyper Light Drifter,One minute in talking about dark souls...fuck off.....please fuck off
Hyper Light Drifter,"You nailed it. You nailed everything about it, especially the soundtrack. I don’t call this game’s soundtrack my favorite of all time lightly. Beyond just being astounding works in terms of sound design and music theory, the way they’re integrated into the emotional flow is breathtaking.

I think my personal favorite may be the drowned colossus in the east, the placid lilting of those airy chords giving way to the thick grinding bass like you can feel it making the lake vibrate under your feet. It’s unforgettable. This *game* is unforgettable."
Hyper Light Drifter,Incredible Video - Two Thumbs Up - Well Done - Immediately Downloaded It
Hyper Light Drifter,How can you call this TRASH the best game ever? Have you ever heard of Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen? That you can call the best RPG game ever created. The combat style from that game is EPIC!!!
Hyper Light Drifter,Man the chills at the end..
Hyper Light Drifter,I just wish more people talked about this game
Hyper Light Drifter,"You convinced me to buy it, so thank you."
Hyper Light Drifter,"He reads the main moral of the story of the Drifter as coming to terms with mortality and struggling to leave something behind  that is valuable. I see it more in line with a real search and desire for immortality, something I think we all have, and something that the drifter is able to find after his death in the after-life. I could say more about how his own dark enemies and the good works he does in the world tie in with this, but that may require my own video."
Hyper Light Drifter,Really good work on this vid. I enjoyed this game a lot.
Hyper Light Drifter,The chain dash gives me flashbacks of doing it 800 times in a row every run because I really like the purple armor.
Hyper Light Drifter,This is a really fantastic review.
Hyper Light Drifter,This video is just way too good.
Hyper Light Drifter,"There is more to learn about the story of HLD than people usually let on. It's just hidden behind visuals, not outright spoonfed to us through words, except the monoliths with the alien glyphs on them, which can be deciphered, and they reveal some important lore :)"
Hyper Light Drifter,"2 minutes in and the buttery smooth voice has sold me.



Also, I believe bloodborne is more dark souls than dark souls."
Hyper Light Drifter,"Who is this handsome fella with his pastel style and why have I never heard of him before?
Great video, you gained a sub"
Hyper Light Drifter,"Not to sound like a “nob”, but I suck at video games yet found HLD to be pretty easy. Only NG+ was particularly difficult. Outside of NG+, there was one boss at the game’s beginning that will probably give players trouble. Don’t get me wrong, the game is very enjoyable and worth a buy, but “difficult” is not how I would describe it. Additionally, I would argue that Dark Souls is perceived as difficult because many of the bosses and enemies (not to mention some of the set-up of the areas) encountered as the player progresses have abilities that are downright cheap whether you’re cautious or not. In fact, some of them are only a problem if you give them too much respect."
Hyper Light Drifter,This is great. Feel like a friend is telling me about a game I should play with a littler “YouTuber” thrown in. Been wanting to try this game out for a while now
Hyper Light Drifter,Awesome video review.  My Mother In Law passed away on Friday and her funeral was today.  That said your review was something I could relate to and it’s amazing that a video game can be so touching. I bought this game on PC and didn’t get very far but became interested again when I heard this game will be released on the Nintendo Switch this summer.  First time on this channel so I did sub and love that you didn’t ask for money or likes or anything else.  Thanks again.
Hyper Light Drifter,Thanks Matt :)
Hyper Light Drifter,26 years old and this one of the greatest games I have ever played in my life
Hyper Light Drifter,"A nob?  What the hell is a nob?.....Oh, noooooob.  Gotcha.  ;)"
Hyper Light Drifter,Wow. This is a great piece on HLD. Really should get around to replaying this one.
Hyper Light Drifter,you need pyre in your life. please look at pyre it's as beautiful as hyper light drifter but well it's a visual novel of sorts and all about running a fantasy sports team rather than actual hand-to-claw/hoof/scaly warped (talon????) combat
Hyper Light Drifter,The only thing holding this game back from being flawless are the goddamn fps drops
Hyper Light Drifter,"I think us 'Matts' have a propensity for delving, exploring, and maybe even probing into the intense feelings associated with our own existentialism and mortal brevity - what a nice soliloquy on that!"
Hyper Light Drifter,that wasn't really a funny joke
Hyper Light Drifter,"This was an amazing ""review"" of this wonderful game.
The moment you picked at the beginning, I literally felt the same.
You described it so well... I cannot even find the right words.

Good work."
Hyper Light Drifter,i was on the fence about this game. i am now sold
Hyper Light Drifter,"Man, I only just found these reviews and can't stop watching them. This guy delivers the most intelligent and engaging reviews i've heard for a long long time, absolutely brilliant. Great delivery, peppered with nice dry humour. His review of No Man's Sky is the best i've seen/listened to by a country mile. He should've worked for EDGE magazine back when it was great. Good job."
Hyper Light Drifter,"I won't be so exaggerating to the point that I'd deem it miles below Dark Souls in terms of difficulty. But to be frank, it's really not very difficult when compared to Dark Souls, especially after you acquire more skills and after you become familiar with enemies' attack patterns. Some people dislike Hyper Light Drifter because of either its difficulty in battling the enemies, or its 'convoluted' path-finding, neither of which I found problematic during my playthrough. It's a challenging game and an extremely well-crafted masterpiece imo. And to those who struggle with path-finding, you must not have played classic Tomb Raider games back in the 90's. For they are what hardcore gamers grew up with and they were not that hard even during that time, when people were first exposed to these kinds of games."
Hyper Light Drifter,"Anyone ever tell you that sometimes you sound like that bloke from portal 2? not just the accent either, sometimes your speech patterns and joke delivery remind me a lot of him"
Hyper Light Drifter,MATT LEES IS ADORABLE
Hyper Light Drifter,Great review.
Hyper Light Drifter,"So let me see if I got this right this game has a journey like narrative with a furi type battle system and the legend of Zelda esk world 
Did I get the comparison right or just kill me for comparing"
Hyper Light Drifter,"So I decided to get this game after watching this review. Just finished it five minutes ago, and I'm still crying deep inside... Talk about a gorgeous game. Just wanted to leave a quick thanks for pointing me towards this experience, which I've never seen the equal of in video games."
Hyper Light Drifter,Finally someone that really sees a game for what it is
Hyper Light Drifter,When can I have the That's a Funny Joke sound clip as my ringtone.
Hyper Light Drifter,"I bought the game because of this video, well I actually saw many others and heard quite a few people praising the game but this was the last drop :)
Cheers!"
Hyper Light Drifter,I love Matt Lees
Hyper Light Drifter,"never seen such analysation of soundtrack alone;
legendary vid,
thanks Matt"
Hyper Light Drifter,"15,000 views 70 comments and 1,000 likes... Something is off about this"
Hyper Light Drifter,"YES! The sound design caught me in the same way, it was excellently timed with player progression and visual leads. The art and sound direction is outstanding. 
The game is a work of art, NES-hard brutality to the player not withstanding."
Hyper Light Drifter,i got stuck.
Hyper Light Drifter,"I think I would have enjoyed this more if the difficulty stemmed from the boss battles or enemy design, but the performance was my main enemy! When it saved when I had 1 health point near a nest of enemies, or when the frame rate drops into the teens was when it was most difficult. The lack of polish here really hamstrung my experience, as did the placement of those keys you pull up. I should not need to hug the wall in every area 😡."
Hyper Light Drifter,"Thanks for this. My favorite game from last year. Some really thoughtful works coming from indies in the last few years.

This goes with Transistor."
Hyper Light Drifter,This game is SO. GREAT. Thank you for giving it some recognition
Hyper Light Drifter,One of the best games I've ever played.
Hyper Light Drifter,"Just gonna nitpick a bit.  Why'd you talk over that one bit where you're trying to show off the soundscape?  It pulls away from it.

Good video overall though, I'm probably gonna wind up picking up this game now"
Hyper Light Drifter,"ah gunstar heroes, one of my favourite games growing up"
Hyper Light Drifter,"have you guys played Continue9876543210? it's about a dying playersprite trying to stay alive a little bit longer in the netherworld where it's awaiting the trash collector. very much of a piece with Matt's comment at the end about Hyperlight being about being able to find some peace, although the playersprite's search for meaning makes me baaasically tremble and shake constantly with emotion in a way Hyperlight didn't."
Hyper Light Drifter,"""Thats a Thats a Thats a funny joke"" Love it every time. Not sure if its the usual ""bad"" joke before it or if its just that good on its own.
4:44 - really nice transition.
7:10 - a better one"
Hyper Light Drifter,I really liked the darker tracks in FEZ.  It was spooky and made me cautious and yet at the same time really excited that I might discover something amazing.  Kind of like what the character in that game was going through.
Hyper Light Drifter,"Sorry, no amount of awe in the tone of your voice can obscure that this is not that great of a game. I enjoyed it enough. Was worth getting on sale. Happens to be one of my favorite soundtracks of all time, also. But the game really fell short in many ways. The pacing of the game was awkward and I think they tried to make it seem like a nice open world experience to distract you from that. The placement of enemies was weird too. While we all get combat fatigue in a game, there were too many areas where I'm just standing there like, ""Where's all the stuff to kill?"" Which was a shame cause I actually thought the combat felt pretty satisfying."
Hyper Light Drifter,Got Shrouded in Sanity on sale. Nasty little bugger.
Hyper Light Drifter,"Great video really showing what makes video games special demonstrating what a huge impact it can have for the creator and players. the subtle lessons that unravel slowly giving that moment were an epiphany hits you what the game is really about leaves you with an impression that is truly unique in video games in my opinion. Just look at games like the beginners guide which is a more useful lesson in depression, self doubt and anxiety more than a 10 000 page study. And instead of reading the information realising it yourself is that much more personal and powerful. Sorry for a bit of a rant but it's just great to see any kind of media covering great content instead of the usual dull ign videos regurgitating rubbish. Keep up the great work"
Hyper Light Drifter,"Was that... a Gunstar Heroes reference at 1:04?

PROPS."
Hyper Light Drifter,Got deep in the end there for a moment.
Just Shapes & Beats,"Don't forget, we are giving away a free game each month for thoughtful comments and engaged subscribers!"
Just Shapes & Beats,This game is my type the review was important for me but I have an question. Is this an cartridge or a download?
Just Shapes & Beats,Dear god this game blew me away. I can feel the bass on my eyeballs.
Just Shapes & Beats,Is this on pc
Just Shapes & Beats,this game is absolutely incredible
Just Shapes & Beats,"well.. the controls ARE a little..... slow though lol. They don't react as quckly as they could lol

Reminds me of Beat Hazard"
Just Shapes & Beats,Cool
Just Shapes & Beats,How did I miss this review? I think I have this on the ps4 but never played. I see it is on sale on the eshop. Is this definite a buy for me. Perfect fit for the switch.
Just Shapes & Beats,I watched your review and decided to buy the game! Thanks for this on point review!
Just Shapes & Beats,You are a good youtuber i wish to get this free game at walmart
Just Shapes & Beats,Omg this game must be hard as hell
Just Shapes & Beats,"This looks great, never noticed it on the shop."
Just Shapes & Beats,Played this game earlier and have to say it’s pretty cool...your review was right on the money😎👍
Just Shapes & Beats,omgad how did i not see this im adding this i always sleep on rythim games XD
Just Shapes & Beats,"Really enjoyed your review, quite a soothing voice for such a hectic game! Really like the music in this, not much heard much about it, think it's been a bit over shadowed by e3 & Fortnite. Thanks for highlighting it"
Just Shapes & Beats,seems like a fun little game to play! You going to be reviewing fortnite on the switch now that it's out? ;)
Just Shapes & Beats,Great review I will definitely be picking this up as it has my kinda music.
Just Shapes & Beats,"Game: Geometry Dash

Wut?"
Just Shapes & Beats,Wow this game looks nuts! I can't keep up with all the good games coming out or I'd pick this up for sure! Maybe there will be a lull at some point but I'm not seeing one anytime soon. Great review!
Just Shapes & Beats,Kinda glad they delayed the release of this game as it gives me a chance to catch up on some other games like west of loathing and” ahem “Suicide guy...also really like the look of Icey (I see)...you haven’t done a review for this one but I might take a chance on it as it’s got some pretty positive reviews on other systems😀👍
Just Shapes & Beats,Awesome can’t wait to play this one...brilliant review dude....thought you would give it at least a 9 though😎👍
Just Shapes & Beats,"first! the music is so beautiful tho! but it’s too flashy, and the boss fight seemed cool"
Just Shapes & Beats,I Wana know how much it costs
Just Shapes & Beats,"Most s ranks were easy at least for me, but on pc. I’ll definitively pick this up on switch as well."
Just Shapes & Beats,"Oh come on! Its very easy! Just be careful with Termination Shock, Cool Friends and Fox"
Just Shapes & Beats,"I love the game, but I only have one complaint and that is that there is many cheeses (ex corners in end Cascade, right in lycanthropy when the ball things are moving around)"
Just Shapes & Beats,Where is my game on Nintendo switch?! I cannot find it! Did it get removed?!?!
Just Shapes & Beats,"I got all S ranks pretty easily, actually."
Just Shapes & Beats,"Wait til it's on sale for sure. This game is not worth 20. 

Some complaints, being knocked off course when hit in a game where delicate spacing is so important is unacceptable even when if it does give you invisibility.

The stages don't reward genuine reaction as much as they do memorizing each level. 

Boss battles having no checkpoints is unacceptable as they can go on for what feels like a long time."
Just Shapes & Beats,Great Review! Love the game on my switch :)
Just Shapes & Beats,Where's my credit card?
OxenFree,They always give these types of games to females to review.
OxenFree,If you're over 35: Avoid.
OxenFree,"Just got this for free on switch and I'm having such an awesome experience. Such a great game. If you're on the fence about it, buy it! Especially on this eShop sale for $2!"
OxenFree,This game is 2$ now 😳
OxenFree,1 euro on the eshop currently!
OxenFree,Intant purchase for $0.99 price woohoooo!
OxenFree,It's $.99 via PS Store right now.
OxenFree,Playing it for the first time now
OxenFree,For those interested on paranormal things instrumental transcommunication is a big part of the game
OxenFree,"Just came from the Nintendo Direct announcing a sequel. Never heard of this game somehow, but seems great!"
OxenFree,Yeah you’re here cus the sequel was announced... and now you want to check out this game..
OxenFree,Me at the end of indie world: huh neat
OxenFree,Some dialogues still ending hurting someone... then don’t choose one 😂😂 then alex wont talk.
OxenFree,Just bought it for $1 dollar.
OxenFree,Anyone else go to these review videos to read the comments and decide based on those whether to buy the game?
OxenFree,Definitely downloaded
OxenFree,"Playing through this now, and the long walks can get cumbersome but make for a scenic route. The background and atmosphere are really captivating and actually quite chilling at times. I did not expect to like it as much as I do."
OxenFree,Just finished my first playthrough. The story is very touching and I loved every minute of it. I'm probably going back through to explore dialogue options.
OxenFree,It really makes you feel like an oxenfree
OxenFree,"Hey guys!!! I would like you all to visit this new upcoming channel called "" FRACROCK"". Pls support this channel."
OxenFree,Music in this review?
OxenFree,I like oxenfree but it is a little overrated.
OxenFree,But does it make you feel like Batman?
OxenFree,"Can someone tell me if it’s scary/creepy, or not so much ?"
OxenFree,and dont forget..pretty boring too
OxenFree,"everytime you play the game, it's like a different kind of story."
OxenFree,"i got as far as ""Clarissa"" at the fire, but her character put me off... on xbox gold. i am curious whether you can ditch her or something.. she's just 'ugh'"
OxenFree,(8.2)9.5-_-@)🎑🎐🎐🎐🎑☑™🔱⚪®🔱™😃😶🎋🎁🎁🎁🎍🎈💝🎈🎊📷📻💿📀💿🔊12_(8)'🌉🌅🌉✈💺🚮🛃🉑✅❇🆚♋💠
OxenFree,It really makes you feel like a teenager
OxenFree,"Don’t play this game while high, at night, with the lights turned off and you listening to it through a headset! Other than that, this game is amazing!"
OxenFree,loved the game. agree with both negatives.
OxenFree,"this game is right up my alley. LOST Tv show, What remains of edith finch, the vanishing of ethan carter, Firewatch, Alan Wake, inside, limbo, alan wake's nightmare... freaking love games like these. You guys have more recommendations?"
OxenFree,I WANT A SEQUEL
OxenFree,10/10 for me
OxenFree,"A sublime, sweet game"
OxenFree,"I’m actually a big fan of the dialogue in this game. I think people focus too much on how “realistic” dialogue is when they should be focusing on how much it fits the tone of the game. If the dialogue was more realistic to how teenagers actually talk, quite frankly it would be a lot more boring."
OxenFree,right now it's free on the epic store if anyone is interested
OxenFree,"now free with the epic games launcher, ya'll better grab it quick!  and the next free game in two weeks will be  The Witness ;)"
OxenFree,You can now get it for free at epic games...
OxenFree,Came cause its free now
OxenFree,"Free on Epic Games guys, be sure to pick it up!(21/3/19)"
OxenFree,who else here cause of EPIC?
OxenFree,This game deserve an awards
OxenFree,Whose here because its free in epic games soon :3
OxenFree,"I'm 2 hours in... no gameplay, just story.
I love story, but I need *some* gameplay.  Please don't let me regret buying this"
OxenFree,Game would be even better if you had the chance to pick a guy in stead of playing as a girl with a guys name. Like I feel like it ruins the dialogue cuz i dont wanna answer as a girl. Naaa ming.
OxenFree,I just finished this game—twice—and it’s easily one of my favourite indie games of all time!
OxenFree,Should be made into a movie. The first time I played it it gave me chills a handful of times from the eerie things that occurred.
OxenFree,It looks fantastic for an indie game!
OxenFree,This game looks like Life Is Strange and Until Dawn combined
OxenFree,"*Greetings, 2016 People.*"
OxenFree,Is it on ps4?
OxenFree,"This game blew my mind man! I've played of about 4 times, and loved it more each time!!! Couldn't recommend it more, also the soundtrack is perfect"
OxenFree,"Did u even play this thing.
Do provide info on what ur playing"
OxenFree,Thanks for the video !
OxenFree,Possibly the slowest paced game I have ever played. Not for me
OxenFree,"They added a huge replayability factor with the timeline loop, it changes the whole game so having to walk everywhere really isn't so bad. Also neglected to mention the secrets littered throughout the island that alleviates the pace of long journeys. 

And to nitpick, you said for more on Oxenfree, stay with IGN or something, but this seems to be your only Oxenfree video"
OxenFree,*Sea of thieves non skippable ad*
OxenFree,0 outta 5 not enough Knack
OxenFree,If anyone doesn't know... playing the game a 2nd time has different stuff that happens.
OxenFree,"I really loved this game, even when I was screaming at 2am over it 😂 (I’m a huge chicken).  The story was really great and if you like mystery/sci-fi/phycological stuff then you’ll enjoy this. Or if you like reading, I’m a big book nerd and this was like watching a book in a way, except I got to choose bits of what would happen next"
OxenFree,"You want to know why this game is awesome, replaying the game makes it even more creepy and mind blowing"
OxenFree,looks very pretty
OxenFree,"* talks about oxenfree*
*not talks about the story only the dialogues*
yep, nothing's changed, it's still ign alright"
OxenFree,6 bucks for this? YES PLEASE! Don't play this at night...
OxenFree,"Average story, average horror"
OxenFree,frikking annoying with garbage unskippable ads well i will reload the page till i get a ad i can skip
OxenFree,For $5 very good game so far
OxenFree,Great little game feels A LOT like Life is Strange
OxenFree,"Yeah, I kinda liked -Oxenfree-"
OxenFree,"Really got into the story driven games like ""Life is strange"" just scored this on switch for $4.99 so I am hoping this will be remotely just as enjoyable."
OxenFree,Saw it on sale last week on switch for 5 bucks came for the review i loved it
OxenFree,"I disagree, the dialogue is actually very realistic, especially compared to other games"
OxenFree,This game was great
OxenFree,"Hello...? H-hellooooo! 

You- you can hear me, right?

Oh, nevermind, this is a letter.

Here, I need you. For a project. It's for..."
OxenFree,so much salt in the comments... let people enjoy things please. not every one of us like the same things
OxenFree,"ITS FREE ON GOG RN GUYS, GO GO GO"
OxenFree,THIS GAME IS FREE ON GOG AND LAYERS OF FEAR IS FREE ON HUMBLE BUNDLE
OxenFree,So is this game worth my 4 bucks or what?
OxenFree,Is no one gonna mention the soundtrack? The only reason why I can ever do homework
OxenFree,I'm here for the Switch version.
OxenFree,"so. on the horror forums suggested me to this game, looks like a great unique experience"
OxenFree,"8.2 for a ""game"" with no game play and listening to ideotic rambling throughout ..... Just because this reminds the reviewer of her own boring pointless past dose not mean this game is anywhere above a 4.1"
OxenFree,"Game yawn, review double yawn. Not a fun game"
OxenFree,"The game is great
And I agree the pacing is slow
But the story is awesome
So you play as Alex who chills with friends and a new step bro
Then u do some illuminati thing with a radio and then u do some things with ghosts that posses your friends and you go through time loops. 
It's legitimately scary with jump scares and disappearances 
(All based on a true story) 
And there's multiple endings as well"
OxenFree,This game deserves a WAY higher review score. At least a 9
OxenFree,"Ugh, your voice is like daggers into my soul!"
OxenFree,"I've been thinking about buying this game, but I do not know if it's better on my phone or my PS4? Any recommendation?"
OxenFree,the game is so unsettling and funky and deep and just emotionally moving that it stuck in my head for a long time. you need 6 hours and some emotional tolerance really :P
OxenFree,This game is prefection. But it and you'll get 15 hours of great story and fun. Buy this game. Now. /Is_leave_possible?
OxenFree,it was a really good game
OxenFree,In my opinion oxenfree is the best game I've ever played
OxenFree,Free with gold on xbox Sept 2017 :)
OxenFree,"Oh nice, another 2d walking simulator with absolutely no replay value. I'm throwing 💰 at my screen but nothing happening ecks deeeee 3=====D~~~~"
OxenFree,"This review really doesn't do the game justice. If you like games like The Walking Dead or Life Is Strange, you will love it. It has a very interesting story and an amazing ending. A great play for anyone who likes story-driven games."
OxenFree,I'm here because it's free on xbox live gold:)
OxenFree,its free this month with xbox gold
OxenFree,Question: Is the horror a serious horror or a light one
OxenFree,Who else here because of Games With Gold?
OxenFree,I love games like this it’s almost like playing a movie
OxenFree,Lol Im just a fan of the game and Im watching every video possible
OxenFree,"That was more of a description of the game, and not a review...nonetheless i enjoyed the vid!"
OxenFree,This game is GREAT !
OxenFree,Really? 1 minute reviews?
OxenFree,OLLY OLLY OXENFREE!
OxenFree,Of course anyone that is subscribed to GameSpot wouldn't give an indie game a second of attention.
OxenFree,"It's a great game, everyone into story driven experiences should not pass this up."
OxenFree,what's the name of the song playing in the background?
OxenFree,I have a feeling I'm going to love this game!
OxenFree,Boring....
OxenFree,fucking terrible music in the background
OxenFree,Theophany soundtrack
OxenFree,i thought it was ben ten
OxenFree,This art looks better than my ex wife.
OxenFree,"Endorsements and 8/10 from Alexa, who had the following personal top 5 best games list of 2015:

Abzu,THIS is what gaming should be about. not stoking anxiety
Abzu,Bro missed the whole point of the game.
Abzu,"This feels more immersive art experience or relaxation therapy than gaming. My speed, which means it might convince me to try this form of gaming at my age LOL."
Abzu,do u gotta buy it?
Abzu,This game helped me mentally.
Abzu,This reviewer is too demanding.
Abzu,Got this onsale for 6$ wow this is a very relaxing game with beautiful art.
Abzu,"This might be one of the worst reviews I've seen in a while,"
Abzu,Yippy-fochen-do
Abzu,What an exceptional piece of art. Must play.
Abzu,Cant beat it for 5bucks
Abzu,Boring but gorgeous is what the story of this game is.
Abzu,"Havent played Abzu, am stressing Sub Nautica but it's a very engrossing game. Onc eyou begin you cant stop. The best undersea game for me though is still the Ecco the Dolphin franchise. It's a shame that it didn't really go anywhere past the Genesis era."
Abzu,First subnactia now this
Abzu,The voice sounds like Steven Crowder if he was nice or calm ever.
Abzu,Didn’t anyone else find it scary in swampy green waters with fish like arapaima
Abzu,Abzu 8.4 and inside a 10.....both a 9 in my opinion
Abzu,Is it 60fps on Series X? Can't be that fluid if it's stuck at 30
Abzu,ive been on the hunt for hidden gem games and it brought me here!!! 👏🏾👏🏾💯 been collecting a lot of classick games lately
Abzu,"its free on ps4 for april 2021, if u get it now you can keep it for free :D"
Abzu,is this playable on PC? thanks
Abzu,Just finished the game because it was free and it was a very enjoyable game
Abzu,Who’s hear from play at home
Abzu,We now have a land version and its called Genshin Impact
Abzu,Short but great experience! The music and graphics made everything so nice
Abzu,Beautiful game
Abzu,4 years later
Abzu,The most beautiful game I've ever played
Abzu,Very boring
Abzu,:you're here checking the reviews because the game is free right now on PS Store
Abzu,Abzu is at least a 9 its a type of game which can help you recover from your depression
Abzu,This game was kind of disappointing after playing Journey. The visuals would have been much better if they enhanced the graphics a tad bit.
Abzu,PLAY AT HOME 🙌🙌🙌
Abzu,Strange game. Beautiful.  Haunting.  Ahhhh an underwater swimming simulator?   Ya but very mysterious and captivating. Very short but worth a playthrough . A true visual dream in the sea.
Abzu,"masterpiece of a game, had me in tears. IGN, sorry but you are ABZUlutely wrong about the score."
Abzu,Who Come here because Play At Home free game
Abzu,so u just swim that's it
Abzu,here after ps plus
Abzu,Who's here after play at home lol
Abzu,Who’s here when the game is going to be free
Abzu,Someone's a Dio fan..
Abzu,subnautica is better
Abzu,We know why your here
Abzu,"Whose here after knowing Abžu will be free as part of Play at Home Initiative. Coming this spring, starting March 25— 10 games will drop as free, so you may wanna check that out."
Abzu,Who came here after Play at Home free update?
Abzu,WhO iS hErE aFtEr iT'S BeEN anNoUnCeD foR fREe oN Ps4
Abzu,Play at home
Abzu,Who is here after it's free at playstation?
Abzu,Will be free on PSN March 25th
Abzu,A dolphin is not a fish.
Abzu,Grabbig a dolphin and saying you can move faster when you grab on to a fish...
Abzu,"bad video. 
Didnt say it had a little bit for everyone"
Abzu,1:15 Grassy Plateau from Subnautica
Abzu,This game is 90% off right now. Total steal.
Abzu,I thought I bought this. Accidentally bought Subnautica. 6/10 not a fun mistake
Abzu,This game is made for VR ... damn shame.
Abzu,this game is boring
Abzu,is this even a game?
Abzu,"Journey but underwater.

*NOICE*"
Abzu,Now it's free!
Abzu,anyone here before its free on epic games ?
Abzu,"Abzu is just so beautiful. Hoping they remaster this game.

HDR and raytracing will make it far prettier."
Abzu,Free on epic games next week
Abzu,Getting it for free next week on Epic games 💯
Abzu,POV: You are here after its free on epic.
Abzu,"I’ve been thinking about getting this game to help fight my fear of large open waters 

I mean grounded helped fight my arachnophobia so surely this can help anyone know if it does?"
Abzu,It was what I hoped it would be beautiful game
Abzu,The new Ecco the Dolphin looks pretty.....shallow.
Abzu,I feel like taking the score down because you want it to be something else makes that the players fault and not the games that is like being being mad at tetris for not having guns
Abzu,It’s one of the most relaxing games I’ve played.
Abzu,Abzu was fantastic. But I think there was more magic in Journey.
Abzu,I really liked this game
Abzu,"I haven't finished the game but I have to tell you, this is amazing. Literally, I was gasping everytime I saw a new species and specially when I learned I could ride them. Oh what a joy of a game this Abzû is!"
Abzu,"I WANT THIS ON SWITCH, PLEASEE"
Abzu,Didn't know Joe Rogan did IGN reviews 😂🐐
Abzu,I just finished it. I’d give it a 7/10
Abzu,Worth playing? *abzulutely*
Abzu,"I can't figure out the controls of this game, its so frustrating"
Abzu,if there was ever a Aquaman game made i would want it to take a few notes from ABZU.
Abzu,My favorite part in the game was the Blue whale that nearly ate you. 🐋
Abzu,"Abzu was 10 times better than Journey. I enjoyed every second of playing Abzu.
honestly, Journey is one of the most overrated games of all time right next to Bioshock infinite."
Abzu,This game got to me I really wanted it to be longer
Abzu,"1:50 ""By grabbing onto fish I could move faster""
*grabs dolphin*"
Abzu,I love an exploration game and ever since Tomb Raider: Underworld I had a craving for an underwater experience. This one flew under my radar.
Abzu,I'm only here because it's free on Epic Games store :)
Abzu,amazing game
Abzu,Should have an endgame
Abzu,I didn't know Joe Rogan reviewed games for ign
Abzu,"Swimming simulator, I think that's the peak"
Abzu,"""let's dive in real life?"" 



""no, let's do it in a game."""
Abzu,Should we tell them that games can be made to be relaxing and not challenging?
Abzu,My one dream is a sequel in space called  ‘Aero’ or something. I need.
Abzu,This game makes me wanna drop acid
Abzu,Try to play it while your high best time ever
Abzu,Loved this game!
Abzu,"I loved ""Journey"", but there's something missing with this game.  While the fundamentals are essentially the same, it's missing a sense of wonder and exploration that ""Journey"".  After the tenth room of touch the fish glyphs, I was bored.  I don't know what it is, either.  Maybe it's the fact that there isn't any actual gameplay mechanics, other than swimming.  With ""Journey"", it had some light platforming challenges that kept you engaged.  With this, you're just constantly swimming and that's it.  It's gets boring quick."
Abzu,"Now here's the real question:
Journey VS Abzu?"
Abzu,I might try it. For a dollar.
Abzu,looks like iam drowning!!!!!!
Abzu,damn  this game was lost on you... it is called relaxation you dope
Abzu,"4:07 ""Riding on atreyu""...? You mean riding on Arthax? Or on the lucky dragon? X)"
Abzu,It kinda feels like a simplified SubNautica.
Abzu,I loved it this is a game I really wanted to experience for a long time and I’m so glad I did
Abzu,"0:20 HOLY FUCKING SHIT HOW DO YOU MANAGE TO SAY THE SAME FUCKING PIECE OF DIALOGUE IN EVERY SINGLE FUCKING VIDEO YOU FUCKING LUKEWARM MOTHERFUCKER FUCK YOU.

""IF YOU'RE INTO IT THEY YOU WILL LIKE IT, BUT IF YOU'RE NOT INTO IT THEN YOU WILL NOT LIKE IT"" FUCK YOU FOR MAKING IGN SEEM LIKE THEY AWARD FUCKING NOBEL PEACE PRIZES AS THEY REVIEW GAMES FUUUUUCK YOUUUUU 🖕🖕🖕"
Abzu,I got this game for free in playstation store during the pandemic Sony gave out free games that time and i got journey the same way along with uncharted series and it was probably the best thing i experienced during that time.
Abzu,"I LOVE this game, beautiful, masterful, emotional... And overpriced... 
Seriously I think it is really good except the playtime is extremely short, and costs 20 dollars. Yes this truly is art, but I felt like it cost a bit much for a game you can finish in about an hour"
Abzu,All i can say is: 7.8/10: too much water
Abzu,AAA games no longer interest me.
Abzu,"Has probably been mentioned somewhere in the comments already: at 4:08 - Atréju is the guy that rides on Fuchur the dragon ;) - And thanks for this ByB on ABZÛ, being a fan of Journey, I think this will be a good choice for me.
Love&Peace
Shen"
Abzu,This game got me into diving and got me over my fear of the ocean
Abzu,I bought this game because of this review . The gameplay was tedious swimming and riding animals not fun. Not smooth. I hate you
Abzu,Due to a “certain” game I can’t relax while I play this because I’m too terrified a reaper leviathan is going to eat me
Abzu,We NEED more games like this that are chill and relax… AAA devs need to take note and make more amazingly beautiful games like this
Abzu,"Abzu was very fun for me on xbox and i wish Journey could be on Xbox as well because it looks really good. 

I mostly play Halo and these type of chill games definately helps scratch that itch when I'm not in the mood for a typical FPS .

It's a great alternative that encourages approaching new places at whatever pace you want as compared to the consistent fast pace FPS.

Like a painting, this game is a beautiful imitation of the real world and i highly recommend 😎🤙🏼"
Abzu,Does people play it on xbox or on a phone????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
Abzu,How can you call this a Game?
Abzu,"People hating the game?


*[grabs journey war machine angrily]*"
Abzu,"People saying it's too similar to journey:

Me:

""My entire playstation account to the backgrounds to the profile picture is journey themed""

 Also me:  I think I'm about to change my identity *[again]*"
Abzu,Warning for some people. I played it for about an hour or two and I got extremely motion sick. It is a beautiful game and it is a good game. But the motion all around you and your constant motion can cause motion sickness if you are sick easily like me.
Abzu,"I finished ABZU and I've got to Say , its gorgeous . The seim , the music , the art direction , the controla who are extremely simple , all make a masterpiece , good for every one, but most special for kids"
Abzu,"its beautiful, but i got scared cuz i have thalassophobia"
Abzu,Would this be an ok game for someone who is kinda scared of deep water/creepy darkness/unknown creatures (and so on) to like lessen their fear of the ocean?
Abzu,PSN has a sale for this for $6.99
Abzu,LSD
Abzu,"This game was a real fresh breath of air for me, which is ironic since it takes place underwater"
Abzu,🤘🖤
Abzu,At times I though of it as an art museum or an opera performance but my favourite level makes me think of it as a ballet performance with me as the star of the show if you’re wondering it’s the second to last chapter or chapter 7
Abzu,I played this and absolutely loved it! What’s this journey game you mention? Is it on switch?
Abzu,Abzu is one of the most beautiful games I've ever played and would recommend to anyone looking for a relaxing and thought provoking game.
Abzu,The brain massage you didn't know you needed.
Abzu,"They aren't a diver, they are a robot lol."
Abzu,"The Underwater mechanic was to begin hard, but more I play, more I understand it. It was my first time play this kind of games :0

Abzu,This looks ABZUlutely beautiful ;)
Abzu,"This game was free on PS Store and wow, even for the simplicity of it, I'd still pay $30 for this game just for the chill music and sights and art. That's legit what this game is, is live art. It's just a peaceful game to pass time by and that's hard to find now days. Especially one that keeps you interested. Definitely an underrated game in my opinion."
Abzu,Its free now
Abzu,To sum the game up. It's journey with real water and sea creatures.
Abzu,its free on ps4 and ps5 right now
Abzu,Play at home haahhaah
Abzu,"I bought the game when it was launched on PC. And loved it, so good game.
And, several years after, it's free on PSStore and I ""bought"" it again for my PS4. I missed it a lot.
The music is so good, the game is so relaxing! :D"
Abzu,Before you download for free

Abzu,Is there free play for this game after you complete it
Abzu,the character in this game should just be a fish or dolphin like the old sega game
Abzu,Credit sharks
Abzu,"It's very pretty, but I found the controls difficult to get used to. Kind of ruined the relaxation for the first half hour. With some patience though I did end up liking it. The key for me is to take it slow, and just float in one spot for a bit. Take it all in."
Abzu,"I have already played this game... Ahhhhhh I love it. It was the game that really got me into the ocean. (Doesn't help that I am landlocked)

Everyone needs this game, it really helps people see how we are impacting the ocean."
Abzu,Beautifully done game but the controlling is frustrating AF
Abzu,This how Aquaman game need be like If there’s ever gon be one near furure
Abzu,4 years ago!?!
Abzu,This game is worth everything
Abzu,I just saw this on a list of games and didn't know anything about it.. All the cons you list are actually pros for me..  Sometimes I just want a relaxing .. no timed challenges.. no dying .. Just a break from the stress of my day.. or maybe to wind down before bed..  This looks perfect !  I don't see anything that I wouldn't like... Great review and description of game .. Thanks !!
Abzu,So fun to get baked and play

Soma,WARNING. THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS.
Soma,"A bit spoiler heavy, no?"
Soma,IGN reviews are cheap boring
Soma,This game is too intelligent for most players.
Soma,"DONT WATCH THIS! SPOILERS! play the game without any trailer or anything. Trust me, this game is great and has one plot twist after another."
Soma,Why is IGN so popular with their crap reviews.
Soma,"This game is a masterpiece. The scoring means nothing.

Sure the gameplay itself is nothing new, but everything else is 10/10"
Soma,Soma deeze nutz
Soma,Just a big story spoiler the whole review lol
Soma,"Pre faced?  

Its pronounced ""preh fissed"""
Soma,a well worded opening sentence immediately made me download it
Soma,"Nice concept, awfull gameplay mechanics, straight from ps1 era,not fun at all,annoying puzzle solving and brain dead enemy ai, not recomended 5/10"
Soma,What is the name of this song?
Soma,The voice acting in this game is amazing especially the woman I forgot her name.. This has some of the best voice acting I have heard second after the last of us
Soma,One of the worst reviews I've ever seen.
Soma,An IGN reviewer talking about being pretentious.....ah the irony
Soma,Masterpiece game 👍👌
Soma,"can't help but think this is ""Amnesia Rebirth"" sequel / crossover"
Soma,Omg☹️😢😢😱😭
Soma,Aghhhhhghg
Soma,I agree with lot of comments here- many things in video should be considered spoilers. Its one of the best story in a video game- its sad its not getting its due recognition..
Soma,You know it's an instant buy when IGN gives score below 9.
Soma,DO NOT WATCH JUST PLAY
Soma,"IGN: COD AW 9.1, Soma 8.1

Soma fans: THEY'RE NOT US!!!!!!!"
Soma,"spoil the game & mostly talk bad about it, wtf man ?"
Soma,I want to see more games like this one...
Soma,I am SO glad I didn't watch this review before playing the game! It spoils SO much of the first half of the game. I'd be pissed!
Soma,3:13 thank you. I can finally get past the stage 🤗
Soma,to heavy on spoilers... im glad i play the before this review...
Soma,"""The Turing quest"" ""incognito ergo sum"" wtf??"
Soma,It is free on epic today. Thumbs up so people can see.
Soma,2:25 yes you can with Terry Akers and any Proxy in the game noob lol
Soma,"Meh, I never found games like that (Outlast, Amnesia, Alien) to be particularly scary. The moment I have no way of defeating an enemy (or even have the Illusion of it) my Fear vanishes. Its like ""Oh well, he got me, nothing I could do about it anyway.....<reload savepoint>"". Games like Alan Wake, Resident Evil 2, Silent Hill 2, The Evil Within on the other hand scare the living hell out of me. Especially the ""will I have enough Bullets?""-Part."
Soma,"This review ruins the game by laying out upcoming sets and environment changes, setting expectations about when the player should be most ""terrified,"" but most importantly, revealing why the robots speak so humanly at the beginning of the game as you try to piece together what is going on in the story. 1 out of 10 review."
Soma,"Lol how whas the ""puzzle"" to call in the zeppelins to theta too hard to figure out? The only thing you have to do is find the panel, the rest is extremely self-explanatory."
Soma,6/10 Need a battle royale
Soma,So much of spoilers in this review.. :(
Soma,This game still doesn`t have a physical version. Why !?
Soma,Ign reviewer can't figure out basic puzzles. That's kinda sad
Soma,No psychical release wich was weird.. Soma went kinda big in the horror indie scene
Soma,Is there any combat in this game?
Soma,THIS VIDEO CONTAINS SPOILERS
Soma,Not getting this game now due purely to how spoiler-y this review was. Thanks a lot.
Soma,So unfair 10/10
Soma,Put a spoiler alert on this already!
Soma,free on gog
Soma,worth playing or pass what you guys thinks

Soma,Ps plus December 2018
Soma,Ps plus anyone?
Soma,wow I guess I don't need to play the game now...
Soma,I love it cuz its not the monsters and creepy places that scared me its psychological impact it has on you. Humans are fragile beings and they question the meaning of life
Soma,This game has some of the best voice acting ive ever heard
Soma,"A really smart and thoughtful review. Explains why smart people should like this game. More depth than I expected from IGN, nice job!"
Soma,I spent 10 minutes messing around with Cath's undies. :^)
Soma,How tf did you play for twelve hours and not notice how the monsters or puzzles worked?  My playtnrough was just under nine hours and I figured mostly all mechanics out.
Soma,9.5 / 10
Soma,"0/10 when reviewing this review video
Obviously you haven’t played all the way and haven’t tried to interact with the environment more 













Or you just dumb lol"
Soma,Good job spoiling the plot of the  game
Soma,"I have to say what a BRILLIANT game to play! It's pretty scary as well, few moments gave me proper goosebumps... and trust me I am big fan of OUTLAST games so I do not scare easy. I purchased this game as it was discounted after I saw the very positive feedback it got on Steam. I can surely confirm this is a great game and you must play it if you like Sci-Fi Horror genre. I don't consider most of the reviews to be accurate here. The amazing positives I found in Soma:    Thrilling atmosphere, One of the best sounds in the game, Intuitive tasks and mainly Fantastic story. Simply put the SOMA is an awesome movie which you can actually play."
Soma,SPOILERS! Come on dude.
Soma,"So far it’s fun, I like it. You didn’t give it a good review, I take it you didn’t care for it very much, not your type of game I guess."
Soma,"This review is so inaccurate and generally so badly done (amateurish, rushed, wrong gameplay description, etc.), that really makes me wonder why is still up 3 years later. This video also reassures that I have unsubscribed your biased channel months ago."
Soma,SOMA on the Xbox One X is the best
Soma,Easily one of the best games ever made.
Soma,"Reminded me of alien isolation and bioshock, both of which were better games, but this is still a good title, worth playing."
Soma,"""I think, therefore I am..""
Am WHAT?"
Soma,SOMA arriving to Xbox One/Xbox One X this fall. includes Xbox One X enhancements.
Soma,its outlast underwater
Soma,"Really!?  No idea how you summoned the Zeppelin?  That was extremely simple.  In fact all the ""puzzles"" in this game are."
Soma,"Think it's funny how he talks about uncovering the story and figuring out what's happening but then he says the robots are ""spewing oil"" and didn't get the structural gel part and the WAU.... completely missed like a giant portion of the story. Then he goes on to say ""frustratingly there's no discernible way to avoid them"" as a statement not as a personal problem he had, I say this having beaten the game and never ONCE being caught on my first play through (of course minus the part where the blind one catches you as a part of the story and puts you in structural gel). Then he says throwing objects doesn't lure enemies when yes it does with the enemies that sense sound only."
Soma,been wanting this and just got it for $8.99 from a ps4 flash sale lol
Soma,"This review:
''You spoiled a lot! 2 out of 5'' - IGN"
Soma,Spoiler alert IGN! Thanks a lot.
Soma,"Some weak gameplay elements for sure, but this was an experience I'll never forget."
Soma,"“Doesn’t really seem like it adds up to anything” this is the lowest IQ review of soma I’ve ever seen. This game isn’t about jump scares, the horror in the games is existential dread and the question of what you define as human. This game went right over your head."
Soma,I love your videos but it seems u missed the mark on this one. Also I think you played it on easy.
Soma,this game need to be in vr
Soma,Wouldn't this perhaps had worked better as movie? The story is pretty interesting and filled with philosphical questions but I don't know if I ever need to replay the game as the story is all there is and the gameplay highly linear.
Soma,I spent a lot of time trying to find where I need to go. It is annoying and boring.
Soma,Second worst review ever after Hbomb's DS2 mess.
Soma,"So ur saying the $5 sale is def worth it at least, thanks"
Soma,"""minor spoilers""  - in first 20 seconds tells all the turning points (yes many suspect things, but it is very vague for long time, alternative options exist.  :/    puts ""Soma"" and ""dissapointed"" in one sentence... :/"
Soma,"🦠 The „Level-Design“ & „Art-Style“ of some Areas reminds me on „Necrumunda: Hired Gun“, „Bioshock“, „Dead Space“ & „Space Hulk: Deathwing“. 🦠

👍👌"
Soma,I love how all the comments I've read so far are in disagreement. you kind of deserve it for this awful take.
Soma,"Perhaps spending a bit more time playing the game will result in you being a tad more accurate.  The game does NOT hold your hand, and many of the puzzles require pieces from different rooms.  If you are a bull and just want to get lucky, flicking all the buttons until you stumble on the correct sequence that is on you.  The rest of us paid attention, tried not to die, and were able to expereince a great horror game that does not rely on jumpscares to pretend it is horror.  You probably liked Five Nights At Freddy's.  Heck I just opening a new window and searched, and sure enough you did.  You claim the same gameplay elements in it were great, but not in SOMA.  You need objective standards."
Soma,I love watching the low IQ reviews of soma all these years later after it's been permanently cemented as a quintessential horror master stroke. Like how The Thing got terrible initial reviews and now it's a known masterpiece.
Soma,"Not surprised you failed to understand this game, given that you’re a moron that’s only entertained by tits and gore"
Soma,This game was incredible. Idk what these reviewers were talking about.
Soma,"For real, Soma is an absolute classic, the best horror game of 2015... One day it will rediscovered by the internet and people will git it the attention it deserves"
Soma,*w r o n g O P I N I O N*
Soma,"One thing I loved in SOMA were those 'kill or let live' choices. Because they weren't intended to progress the plot, they were there to make you ponder of the game's main question, kinda implicitly breaking the 4th wall - ""What is life? Where is an edge between simply existing and living?"". And the fact that those events were layed out in a progressive trend, starting from what seems a robot parroting human to consciousness trapped on seabed to a real human without a future."
Soma,"I hate puzzles. I'm glad the game didn't bother me too much with that bullshit.

p.s. it took me 12 hours to finish it, that includes reading all of the notes and opening every locker, etc. i even died a few times. it's not a particularly hard game."
Soma,"This reviewer has no idea what they are talking about. Missed the point entirely, why do you even call yourself a reviewer? You're just bad and contrarian."
Soma,i think soma is amazing tbh
Soma,I'm shocked that this game more or less went over your head. It is truly a masterpiece. I think you would benefit from re-playing it with an open mind. It isn't just any old fps horror game.
Soma,"the story is not that good,  just because something is depressing doesnt mean its an art masterpiece"
Soma,"I strongly disagree. The story is what makes it so special, not the gameplay. I think Frictional Games is a master of story telling. All their stories were made to stick in my mind YEARS after I played the actual game. 

Maybe you're just not the type of person for these games.... and that's totally fine. There are so many other horror games with a more ""straight forward"" story and better gameplay.

For my part... I loved playing SOMA and thinking about questions like...

 ""What even makes us human beings?"""
Soma,"Story is ""pretty good""? Man I really feel like you missed out on this experience man. This was not only one of the greatest stories in a game ever but also one of the best sci fi stories told in ANY medium. Please watch Joseph Anderson's video on Soma. he does an exceptional job analyzing it to it's full potential. 

Also, the complaint that 'the game didn't explain what I was supposed to do' is such an invalid complaint. Sure hope this gmanlives never tries out Dark Souls..."
Soma,"I really enjoyed Soma, but I also agree with basically everything you said here. It's a fantastic _experience,_ but not a very good video game."
Soma,I think people tend to ignore how this type of single player games tend to tell a story and make you experience something as if you were reading a book.. but being a character in first person.. as if you didnt even understand the game
Soma,"'....little to no backtracking...'

I'm in."
Soma,soma deez nuts ha
Soma,"i love this game's story, or rather the philosophy of it, it's so intriguing to me that it makes me feel like running up to the nearest person and having a deep discussion about it. The gameplay however is where i feel it's lacking in some aspects, because i feel it could've easily been better constructed, more engaging, and be more intellectually challenging, especially when compared to how well they've handled the thought-provoking subject matter."
Soma,I really enjoyed this game! I got it dirt cheap to boot!
Soma,"In general I like your reviews but you missed hard on SOMA...years after the release one of the rare if not the only ""horror"" game with an ""overwhelmingly positive"" rating by users on Steam...and man, what a story, never dull and a very rewarding ending....damn, I wish I never played SOMA before so I could play it again with the same interest as the first time..."
Soma,I ‘got it’ but I do think it’s a played out story as far as sci fi goes. Not that I’m saying it’s bad or a bad idea but I certainly don’t get the hype 🤷‍♀️
Soma,"""SOMER"" hehe. I just beat this game again cause it was raining and watched this review to hear ""somer"" :P"
Soma,A vastly superior game to Amnesia in almost every aspect. I also appreciate the horror element with only regretting that they didn't include more interesting enemy types and different enemy interactions like they promised early on. This game is really underappreciated considering how much of a masterpiece it is.
Soma,One of the best horror game in these gen
Soma,My god I loved that story...masterpiece for me. I just wish they could make game with scare of Amnesia and story of Soma...that would be horor which will be in hall of fame. edit (SPOILER): rly...you woulds spoil such a spoiler as you are robot. RLY??!!
Soma,Who's somer
Soma,"You are usually on point, but totally missed it with this review. 
SOMA is a storytelling masterpiece. The ending just carves into your mind and stays with you forever. 
You dont play these kind of games for gameplay, its an interactive book basically."
Soma,"Only just started this review, but I have to say, even as a huge DOOM and Quake fan, this was one of my favourite games I played in 2016.... The story really resonated with me, and as someone who found the Amnesia series a bit hit and miss, I found the graphics and art style beautiful, the monsters terrifying and this is as about as far away as you can get from a standard FPS. Walking simulator could be a fair assessment of it, but the stealth and action sections are both exhilarating and absolutely horrifying.... AND OMG THE SOUND DESIGN!!! Beautiful... One of the best 8 hours I've ever spent."
Soma,I don’t know i found this game really scary. Not as much as Amnesia: The Dark Descent but i thought the sound and visuals were absolutely incredible. And i loved the story especially towards the end. Great game.
Soma,"Sorry, but this is one of the best games I have played - completed it over a year ago now yet still think back to it in terms of the ending and what it meant.
The gameplay was perfectly suited to the story."
Soma,"Philistine... Stick to your shooters, matey."
Soma,Item management is the cornerstone of horror? The fuck? What about Outlast? P.T? The shit you know about horror is as shit as the quality of this review.
Soma,I am sorry but since this game takes place in the frigging depths of the ocean IT HORRIFIES ME ... water scary
Soma,"a game concept that is horrifying with an ending that will bother you, however I am not harsh towards Soma but will kick Amnesia to the curb because for one, Soma hasn't either broken down or gave me the middle finger and decides to be picky about progression, Amnesia did, two levers that didnt work then I find some dude's husk and soul tells me they work and try again, so I do just that and the levers do not work, soft block now I will say your survival buddy despite being apathetic at times or sounding apathetic is more towards the game like Simon will complain about the monsters that are about while she simply reply with ""just dont look at them"" as if the concept of death is nonexistant which hints toward the fact that she might have ""died"" a few times"
Soma,This is my favorite “scary” genre type game ever. I don’t know what it is but this game effected me very profoundly.
Soma,"Man, Markiplier was right. If the message goes over your head then this game just won't be appealing. It's a great game, but your lack of understanding of what the game was actually going for really kills it. Also, 7 minutes for a review?? That's pathetic"
Soma,✌😏 Good Game and its DRM Free yay! 😍👍
Soma,How good was the subway scene. I knew this game was based in Toronto just by the osgoode station sign. Uncanny.
Soma,The message was pretty clear. Its about finding an answer to what makes someone human. Is it your mind; the memories and experiences that make you you. Thats catherines belief. Or is it the actual physical form; that familiar shape we recognize even as the details differ from person to person; as the WAU believes.
Soma,I liked it and there some encounters that were challenging like the creature that can pick up on sound and the puzzles weren't bad at all
Soma,"Holy crap, I skipped this one after watching your review, but I played it anyway because it was free on GOG.  This game is incredible!  I thought Amnesia was good, but this blew my socks off.  I can understand your criticisms, but you made it seem like this wasn't worth playing.  This will be one of the most memorable story-driven games for me.  It definitely destroyed Amnesia in that regard."
Soma,it's free on gog for limited time now be fast
Soma,This is probably the worst SOMA review i've seen. If you can't derive that the story (which is downright amazing) is the best part about this game then why do you bother to review games at all? I mean so much of what you said just wasn't fair towards the game. Really dissapointing
Soma,"""minor spoiler"""
Soma,Go play the game yourelf. I think you'll realise that he is immensely wrong... This game deserves a full score. Best horror game i've ever played
Soma,"Eh... it’s derivative but I loved it. It’s just about the only walking-simulator-type game that managed to hold my attention the whole way through. 

I thought the inventory management and puzzles were poorly implemented in Amnesia so I appreciated them being streamlined here. I really think people look back at Amnesia with rose-tinted glasses, I just played Amnesia and Soma for the first time back to back and I’m struggling to understand the complaints you and others have with Soma. The experiences you described with unclear puzzles, narrow level design, and infrequent monster encounters were all far worse for me in Amnesia. Plus Soma has way better story and atmosphere. The exploration, puzzles, story, and enemy sequences all gelled together really well for me, whereas Amnesia felt like I would be in a horror section for 30 minutes and then be in a puzzle section for 30 minutes. It felt like 2 separate games to me where Soma felt like one cohesive experience.

I will admit the monster AI could be frustrating and the game desperately needed 1 more choice at the end  with separate endings... I think you’re right that it was trying to say something at the end. I think it’s saying that people have souls that exist outside our physical bodies. But the game presented the subject so vaguely, even contradicting this theme at times, and gave you so much choice up to the end, it felt inappropriate to funnel everyone into the same ending. Otherwise I loved it! Liked it a substantial amount more than Amnesia and even Bioshock!"
Soma,"I saw this game from a dude playing on mixer, and he had an interactive mixplay on that as well as chat.. I think from where I was viewing from at that time, it was even cooler, playing that game alongside 3 others, trying to figure out where to go and so on."
Soma,"What a pointless review. SOMA isn't a horror survival game, it's more of an interactive story that aims to disturb you through its sound design and themes. It's not supposed to have puzzles or item management, its all facilitative of the story.

The fact that he complains that the conversations never go anywhere and that the moral choices are binary is weird too. The whole game is about asking questions of what it means to be human, whether a copy is as real as the original person and whether a simulated existence is one worth living. 
I don't get how you can miss the point this badly unless you solely play scary games for the visceral entertainment of fighting monsters."
Soma,"Soma is a horror masterpiece, fight me!"
Soma,Man this game is messed up
Soma,"Have to disagree with you entirely here. SOMA is a horror game, where the horror is not in the gameplay, but rather in the story.
Item management is not the cornerstone of a horror game, Outlast worked pretty great without it, just like a bunch of other indie horror games.
The story it tells is fascinating and really interesting, far superior to any other Frictional or horror title."
Soma,"Way to go missing the entire point of the game. This game was amazing in so many ways, namely the story, atmosphere and imense details."
Soma,"hey,can you review ""Unforgiving"""
Soma,This review made me unsubscribe from you. Fucking garbage.
Soma,"Finally got around to playing this and gotta say its a great game if frustratingly slow at times. Story is excellent as is the majority of voice acting.
I have to say I had to resort to guides to get past some areas as I got totally stuck on some puzzles. One are I happened to be facing in a direction that meant I just missed a small panel that opened next to me where a device essential to progression was. 
I spent a long time trying to figure out what I'd missed and backtracking multiple times throughout the area before finally getting frustrated and resorting to a walk through guide... where I realised I'd just missed the small panel opening.
Good game though with genuinely suspenseful parts but certainly not fast paced action"
Soma,STOP LOOKING AT ME! *Smacks you own and leaves*
Soma,"I consider SOMA to be one of my all time favorites, from a gameplay standpoint absolutely nothing innovative or new, but the atmosphere, immersion, and story were all top-fuckin-notch. Great voice acting and writing. And although it wasn't incredibly scary, there were some really intense moments that had me on edge. 
Also, I do fully get the comparison to walking simulators, but I think it's just one step beyond how most of those are, there's just another level of interactivity and action in SOMA that most don't have, it never really feels dull at all like most walking simulators do, to me anyway. 
I think the game accomplished exACTly what it was meant to, and the philosophical dialogue it examined still sticks with me today."
Soma,Should’ve discussed story & themes.
Soma,"thought provoking stories in video games aren't for everyone, just saying"
Soma,"Goodie, avoiding murderous rowboats on the bottom of the sea is my favorite :)"
Soma,"Meh not worth the money it's pretty much a walking simulator.  

It would be better off as a movie or something."
Soma,"Soma is a storytelling game. That's ok, but it's not what I expected."
Soma,Bad fucking review.
Soma,"This is probably the worst review I've ever seen. Honestly, most of his points are shiet and everything just went over his head. I'm sure he fell into a typical trap of ""I need to play games for review, NOT for the sake of them being entertainment."" That's why he's readily amused by simple satisfying gameplay games. They are just piss easy to review in this mentality. What a joke."
Soma,"I think the story is not about telling the player a message rather than asking questions. (For example ""What defines identity?"")"
Soma,"Never review frictional games  again, you just don't get what kind of games they are making. They are not for everybody."
Soma,"I'm surprised you didn't' like this one. I think the philosophical, exestential horror in the story of SOMA is much better than other first person horror games like Amnesia and Outlast."
Soma,"Cool review, you do have some good points and reflections. Though I am a bit disappointed that you said next to nothing about the story, which in my opinion was the greatest quality that the game had to offer and I truly think that the storyline alone added a lot to the game's creepy factor."
Soma,"i love this game, and i love your channel, but you seem to contradict yourself sometimes. you complained that the game seemed to be holding your hand. but then you said it shoved you into a puzzle with no help. no hand holding."
Soma,"Its an old video but can someone plz reply: my computer specs are 1.1ghz and 4gb of ram, is that enough to run this game if low graphics are on and the frame rate is 20-30?"
Soma,"What? You didn't get the point of this story? How?? It's so obvious. It debates what makes you human! That's it. And it presents existential crises at important milestones throughout, coloring your mind with faint hints of how you would personally define humanity each time.

And that ending just blows everything outta the park. I mean c'mon, how did you not get the point of the game"
Soma,Who's Haychar Guyger?
Soma,"Such an incredible game. Starts off a bit slow, but goddamn this game grabs you like very few do.. Kind of a shame the reviewer here didn't seem to ""get"" what the game was about: immersion, atmosphere, and narrative."
Soma,i loved soma. one of my fav games.
Soma,That ENDING though... goddam I still think about it ... amazing
Soma,Actually the monster types are all quite different and rely on certain things to spot you. For example: The guy with the Disko ball on his head needs direct eye contact to be able to spot and chase you.
Soma,6:28 Bioshock?
Soma,"This game has it's moments (that naked psycho-dude with bucket on his head inside drowned ship was interesting), yet it has one major flaw: Simon is an idiot, who does not understand what ""copy"" means and keeps throwing tantrums because of that."
Soma,"Quite possibly the most thought-provoking game I've ever played, particularly as pertains to the nature of consciousness. Freaked the shit out of me; but it wasn't the monsters. It was the story. Too bad you didn't get it."
Soma,"And honestly, I felt more scared playing this than Amnesia tbh"
Soma,"You can't avoid the electrical lady in the end, I mean you can't fight her but you have to get near her"
Soma,"personally I loved the game although near the end it really started dragging on. Why is it most horror games you also double as maintenance for the entirety of the game? it would be nice for someone to say just once ""I'll take care of that door lock, you continue on"""
Soma,"loved the game but i got stuck in a staircase when i was being chased by a monster.... i was going down in the staircase and the monster was on my tail but the water kept pulling me up when i tried to go down fast so the moster kept killing me, i never could pass that and uninstalled the game :p"
Soma,"I loved this game. I understand your criticisms, which I mostly agree with, but whilst I was playing it I didn't think about them - the story and story, ideas and characters were too interesting! :)"
Soma,You could take the monsters out and still have a pretty similar game.  Would be been nice to have better puzzles/story and no monsters.
Soma,"Contrary to the review I liked that it wasn't much of horror game and more about experiencing the story. In fact I disliked the scenes where monsters appear since they block your visuals in already dark surroundings. You cannot do much about them especially when you get cornered by them. Graphically it's a beautiful game though the underwater stations become a little bit repetitive. Its main asset is the interesting story although some elements (e.g. WAU) aren't explained very well. A drawback are that the missions become somewhat repetitive: you have to repair this, fetch that etc. All in all recommended if you like this kinda game. It reminded me somewhat of Alien Isolation but that one is more intenser and more frustrating than this one."
Soma,"After playing some recent horror games again, like: Amnesia, Alien: Isolation, and this one; I can confirm that the popular conception - That modern horror games are let'splay YouTuber baits, with load of jumpscares, is very incorrect and biased from several individual games, which became popular network (Mainly Slender and Five Nights at Freddy's). If you don't like watching someone else playing horror games, play them for yourself, instead of bitching about let'splays!
Also, these games have more moments of continuous stress and hunted feeling, than cheesy jumpscares; Especially Soma, which have almost no jumpscare at all.
And those who says that  horror games from the 90s were perfect without cheap jumpscares, go and play the first Resident Evil (a remake came out a few years ago), in case you forgot the zombie dogs suddenly jumping through the window or all those moments were the current camera hinting that there is another corridor around the corner, without showing you the corridor itself, or entering new room, just to almost immediately get attacked by a zombie that stood next to the corner/door!
Don't get me wrong, I love the original Resident Evil, and I also don't think that jumpscares are ruining horror games (at least, if you don't overused them), just wanted to point out some plot holes about a recent popular conception."
Soma,"Thanks man, I think you just saved me a dose of disappointment. I had bought this game in the last summer sale expecting it to be like Amnesia.
I'm just glad I haven't had the time to play it yet so I could come here and be saved from disappointment. So when I play this game I'll be expecting what it really is, not what I think it is. Thank's ^^"
Kentucky Route Zero,Is this even a game
Kentucky Route Zero,Thanks xbox gamepass
Kentucky Route Zero,This is the most boring game I've ever played
Kentucky Route Zero,The aesthetic is reminiscent of Flashback and 'Out of This World'.
Kentucky Route Zero,;
Kentucky Route Zero,so it's sound novel ?
Kentucky Route Zero,If Andrei Tarkovsky would be a game developer
Kentucky Route Zero,What the frick kinda game is this...pause on 5:11 and read that little section there...um ok
Kentucky Route Zero,"wait, those the same guys that made outer wilds? I'm interested!"
Kentucky Route Zero,"You're here cause of gamepass, aren't you?"
Kentucky Route Zero,"Some pieces of media are special for hard to explain reasons.   KRZ is special, kinda the in the same way firefly is special."
Kentucky Route Zero,Shockingly decent review by ign
Kentucky Route Zero,this looks great.
Kentucky Route Zero,what were the other games?
Kentucky Route Zero,"Worst game I've played since...... I don't know, can't think of something worse right now..."
Kentucky Route Zero,"It's on sale on xbox right now, just watched the review, gonna buy it, I love these kind of games."
Kentucky Route Zero,"Ooohh, replaces puzzles with “reams of dialogue”, sounds fuuunnnn."
Kentucky Route Zero,if you appreciate games as art then you need to get this game. It's has by far the best writing in any game i have ever played. it's also wildly creative in the things you do to progress the story. the music is also GREAT
Kentucky Route Zero,"Disco Elysium blew my mind when I played it earlier in the year, so maybe this one's worth checking out?"
Kentucky Route Zero,"This game won't be for everyone but if you're into ambient, surreal, abstract stuff in the vein of Twin Peaks you should definitely give KRZ a shot. I absolutely loved it. And I have to agree with the reviewer- the scene with the song rates up there with one of the most unforgettable moments I've had in a game."
Kentucky Route Zero,DAVIDE STRAMBINO Conservo il silenzio interiore attraverso il rumore
Kentucky Route Zero,Will i enjoy and  understand this game even if i never played a prior one?
Kentucky Route Zero,"If this is supposed to be Kentucky, people randomly breaking into their life story in the gas station is just a point toward realism.

-a Kentuckian"
Kentucky Route Zero,i feel like this would make an incredible book if it were ever novelized
Kentucky Route Zero,Some Twin Peaks fans here ?
Kentucky Route Zero,The Switch version def looks lower res than PC.
Kentucky Route Zero,"""Stunning to look"" at...and ""taking screenshots"" are not lines I would use for this review... -_-"
Kentucky Route Zero,"Ben Babbit, the composer is so underappreciated.
He also did the soundtrack to an indie film titled ""Paris Window"" and my gosh it hits hard."
Kentucky Route Zero,As a Kentuckian I can say this is exactly what Kentucky is like
Kentucky Route Zero,Now 25% off on Nintendo eshop 😉
Kentucky Route Zero,What does this game have to do with Kentucky?
Kentucky Route Zero,"I literally never heard of this game. Hmm...oh well, no I have. o>O"
Kentucky Route Zero,Not a game. It has no game elements
Kentucky Route Zero,Yay....... Reading.
Kentucky Route Zero,"Soo, ummmm, what's this game about ???"
Kentucky Route Zero,Am I the only one who doesn't get why people like this game? Seems pretty boring.
Kentucky Route Zero,0:49 so its a point click not an adventure but still somehow a game?
Kentucky Route Zero,That game cover tho
Kentucky Route Zero,"So Boring, and pretentious. Got it."
Kentucky Route Zero,"this game makes me think of tipp-ex, dirty dirty tipp-ex."
Kentucky Route Zero,This is literally the polar opposite of Zero Punctuation's review.
Kentucky Route Zero,"I remember playing it in a windowless room on a laptop, might get the full thing on PS4. Love it"
Kentucky Route Zero,"It’s weird seeing so many critics and gamers rank this game among the best yet IGN just gives it an 8 and says “yeah, it’s pretty cool”. It’s their opinion and I’m certainly not saying they can’t have it, it’s just a shame they can make or break how well a game does due to their appeal to casual gamers and everyone who hasn’t heard of KRZ will just say “Oh, so it’s just another indie game that isn’t that special.”"
Kentucky Route Zero,The funny thing is it takes place in my state kentucky like about time my state actually had a game
Kentucky Route Zero,The trailer serves the game ZERO justice it's a confusing mess from start to finish that paints no image of what's actually going on.
Kentucky Route Zero,Act V is an abject failure and a waste of three years.
Kentucky Route Zero,"what do you mean by ""stuttering?"""
Kentucky Route Zero,Can't wait for this to be in GDQ
Kentucky Route Zero,This game is boring and pretentious
Kentucky Route Zero,"If you're into writing, this is a must. Best written game alongside Disco Elysium. Feels like a game written by Gabriel Garcia Marquez or Jorge Luis Borges."
Kentucky Route Zero,Is this game longer than Oxenfree?
Kentucky Route Zero,"Jeez, I bought the season pass for this on Steam in what it is clearly now the best part of a decade ago and always thought to return to it over the last couple of years presuming it must surely be complete by then. They've only just finished it?! Oh well, yet another double-dip Steam/Switch purchase coming up then."
Kentucky Route Zero,"Any other games like KRZ, Oxenfree, Night in the Woods?"
Kentucky Route Zero,"this game is a 10/10, one of the most inspiring and most inspired games I've ever played. IGN is too dumb to review something like this."
Kentucky Route Zero,this game is 10 easily
Kentucky Route Zero,"Okay, time to see if this was actually building to something that made at least some sort of sense, or if it was just lynchian “weird-for-the-sake-of-weird” nonsense."
Kentucky Route Zero,Fantastic review
Kentucky Route Zero,isnt this game 7 years old?
Kentucky Route Zero,I think I wanna play this. 🤔
Kentucky Route Zero,Is this like Oxenfree?
Kentucky Route Zero,This game is so fuckin expensive
Kentucky Route Zero,I remember seeing the developer win an award YEARS AGO and then it pops up on switch? This game is in Acts?
Kentucky Route Zero,"Another one of those games that will touch my heart and stuff ?
Nah, I'd prefer mindless bloodshed. DOOM can't come sooner."
Kentucky Route Zero,"1:30 you are ""sure"" there is a ""whole nove's worth"" of text hidden behind the choices you did not take?
As a reviewer - you did not go out of you way to check if your choices actually matter? - Or if it's just an illusion of choice, like in so many other games?!"
Kentucky Route Zero,This game looks boring.
Kentucky Route Zero,The only game I know of that has my home state in the title lol
Kentucky Route Zero,I'm REALLY looking forward to playing this game for the first time!
Kentucky Route Zero,Why can't buy this on PS4?!?
Kentucky Route Zero,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3kkcgIdbuI&t=1283s
Kentucky Route Zero,Wow....I was just 'bout to search up if the 5th Act for this game came out or not and here is the review already. Nice!!!!!
Kentucky Route Zero,It's a 10 at the least
Kentucky Route Zero,I was never really insane except upon occasions when my heart was touched. 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
Kentucky Route Zero,"Who's been a huge fan of *""IGN""* before 2020?

Kentucky Route Zero,First comment
Kentucky Route Zero,Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video. If you want to set up your own website (and get a discount while doing it) hit this link for more info: http://www.squarespace.com/skillup
Kentucky Route Zero,"Ironically, this review comes across as even more exhaustingly pretentious as the game it's trying to review."
Kentucky Route Zero,I love this review. Beautiful work.
Kentucky Route Zero,"I recently played this from game pass and was struck by how much the devs were up their own ass. The people who reviewed this game positively are equally as pretentious in their reviews as the game was itself. Romanticizing and glorifying this game to such an extreme that it can only be taken as them validating their credibility or simply wanting to seem high brow by acting like there’s something deep here while in actuality nothing is even happening. This game and many other ""indie darlings"" that get bombed with great reviews by those who do it just to seem intelligent and stress that games are complex pieces of art are just as damaging to the gaming industry as the triple a corporatization of the some of the top games that come out every year. If there was something beyond pretentious then it’s this game. Do not play this."
Kentucky Route Zero,This game was pretentious and just a mash of words and infantile concepts. Don't waste your time.
Kentucky Route Zero,Are you taking notes from Noah Gervais for your reviews because this feels like that.
Kentucky Route Zero,"I really like that Kentucky Route Zero exists, and some aspects of it were really enjoyable, but I think it missed in a lot of ways, too. Toward the end, it was just so full of disconnected bits that I wanted to amount to something, and they didn't. After awhile, the writing lost it's charm, and came across as poetic mad libs, describe something mundane, then say something overly specific about it, using an unexpected analogy: ""She was brushing her teeth. It was that toothpaste they were selling at Jims, back when it was still called Jims. Smelled like liquorice pretending to be peppermint for Halloween."" Same template, over and over. another black square of text, well not a square exactly, but not quite a rectangle, either, like the shape of colorado to a flat-earther. Like you left a square in the oven a little too long, I guess. Remember that oven we used to have? With the knobs that clicked a little as you turned them, to let you know you were getting somewhere. Or maybe to warn you before you went too far.

Like that..."
Kentucky Route Zero,Ambient synthwave and Twin Peaks. You just sold me hard
Kentucky Route Zero,YE YE its set in my homestate of kentucky
Kentucky Route Zero,"Really great to see that completely unique games like this are now coming to gamepass. I would be very unlikely to buy a game like this, or even be aware of it's existence, but now I have a low-risk way of experiencing it that I hope many others will too."
Kentucky Route Zero,"This review is as pointless as this garbage game. Pretentiousness, thy name is Kentucky Route Zero"
Kentucky Route Zero,2:06 who is this guy and where can I find the full talk?
Kentucky Route Zero,It's good there are other means online to find out what type of game Kentucky Route Zero is.  Because I wouldn't have learned from this review. You should consider applying film schools.  You would fit right in
Kentucky Route Zero,I think you're feeling yourself a little bit to much in this one
Kentucky Route Zero,"I think I went to that same gallery exhibition in London. I walked through dense fog, was just one section."
Kentucky Route Zero,Amazingly great review!!!
Kentucky Route Zero,"All right man it’s official: I frequent about 10 various YouTube review channels for various video game-related content, but there is nobody, and I do mean NOBODY, who can single-handedly weave a desire into my heart and soul to play some video game I’ve never heard of.

Other channels and personalities can relieve a tension or worry I might have about the quality of this game or that, or perhaps they may introduce me to some content I was previously unaware of, and make it seem rather appealing - but there’s nobody else I have found that can almost make me feel BAD that I haven’t played some gem previously hidden or unknown to me.  There’s no other review video in which I have found myself at various points throughout it, feeling compelled to immediately stop what I’m doing and go buy and download some random game, knowing that tomorrow I’ll most likely forget I ever watched the video in the first place. Yet it seems like I find myself feeling this compulsion with every other video I watch. 

You have a true gift, and I really hope you choose to use your powers for good while you exist on this mortal coil."
Kentucky Route Zero,"This game has so much fluff and word salad it's unreal lol.

My lord"
Kentucky Route Zero,TIL British people don't know what Gospel music is
Kentucky Route Zero,I feel like this game was handled with kid gloves because reviewers didn't want to be accused of not getting it. An honest review would have to address how pretentious and self-indulgent it is. I think there is still value to be found here. It's ambitious and occasionally beautiful. But it can also be tedious and annoying.
Kentucky Route Zero,"As a sales pitch, this video is terrible. As a commentary, it is phenomenal.
As a videogame, Kentucky Route Zero is subpar. As an experience, it is transcendent."
Kentucky Route Zero,"When I played this game, I got the feeling of abandoned middle Americana."
Kentucky Route Zero,"This a really,  really essay"
Kentucky Route Zero,This is a really good text
Kentucky Route Zero,That's the best and most accurate review of KRZ I've seen so far!
Kentucky Route Zero,"Oh Shill Up, you tried so hard with this review to be Twin Peaks-like 😂  Stop."
Kentucky Route Zero,this is quite possibly the coolest review of what i consider one of the most important videogames in recent memory
Kentucky Route Zero,The least and most informative review ever
Kentucky Route Zero,"Kentucky Route Zero - Review By Skill Up must objectively be called a review, but if we were better at naming things we would call it... something else."
Kentucky Route Zero,Art game
Kentucky Route Zero,"Repeated ""kentucky route zero"" 18 minutes in basicly EVERY sentence"
Kentucky Route Zero,I feel this game will aggravate my depression but hell I’m buying it
Kentucky Route Zero,This game has taught me what doing meth feels like
Kentucky Route Zero,Still haven't found a game more bizzare than playing Takeshi's challenge followed immediately by Wattam
Kentucky Route Zero,"i had to turn this review off after 10 minutes. Sounds like you are doing an art project on an art project. You have a vein of pretentious-faux-art critic pumping true through some but not all of your reviews. I've gradually learned this facet about your opinions, especially pertaining to indie games, and it has informed me when to take onboard your perspectives as potentially relatable to my own and when to walk away and leave you to your own fare.

I was intrigued by this game, but your review made me groan enough to stop watching.

It is only 20 bucks AUD currently on PSN, so I'll pick it up and give it a whirl nonetheless."
Kentucky Route Zero,"11:38 strangely enough, this soundtrack reminded me of ""Dead Sun Rising"" by Gary Numan."
Kentucky Route Zero,I watched this review a year ago and sometimes I still think about it.
Kentucky Route Zero,"I have tried with this game but just do not get it. The first act was good, it created a bit of genuine intrigue and the dialogue wasn't anywhere near as taxing to scrawl through as the later acts, but as the game goes along it gradually falls down this arthouse rabbit hole where you struggle to see what point it is actually trying to make."
Kentucky Route Zero,This review is quite useless
Kentucky Route Zero,"2 takeaways

1. This will be in your list of top games of 2020.
2. Watching this review while high is a trip."
Kentucky Route Zero,it took me 5 times watching this video to realise that the guy in 00:15 is Ben Babbit (The composer of the game's soundtrack).
Kentucky Route Zero,No
Kentucky Route Zero,From the name and cover I thought this game was about horse racing.
Kentucky Route Zero,Downloading this half way through the video. Hell of a review?
Kentucky Route Zero,Excellent. Just excellent
Kentucky Route Zero,"Kinda pretentious TBH. Some arthouse weird stuff just strung together and called ""art""."
Kentucky Route Zero,"What i learned after watching this

Kentucky Route Zero is a game that could be called something else"
Kentucky Route Zero,"This review must objectively be called a review, but if we were better at naming things we'd call it 'the biggest load of shite' mostly because this review is a mystery, this review doesnt care to actually review the game but rather present a series of conflicting statements that present only segments of an interpretation of what the game is subjectively and not literally.  While this video is titled as a review but if we were better at naming things we'd call it something else."
Kentucky Route Zero,"This doesn't have as many views as Skill Up videos usually have, clearly because it's too good....just like the game :). A video on Fortnite would get millions of views, this gets (see viewcount). In a way that just shows you how people are. But it's still kind of a shame that more people don't seem to want to open themselves up to new, potentially transformative experiences.
Thanks for the hard work on the video and for trying something extra...I appreciated it a lot :)"
Kentucky Route Zero,"It's insane and disappointing that this is probably Skill Up's best review out still, and yet this video performed so underwhelmingly compared to his other reviews."
Kentucky Route Zero,I have oxenfree and someone mentioned this game to me cause it’s kind of similar in a way I guess??
Kentucky Route Zero,you are my favorite game reviewer. Thanks for all the nuance and details and objectivity.
Kentucky Route Zero,This review blew my mind. So glad I found this channel because I'd say the reviews here are *something else*.  It's so wonderful to see such consideration for the audience/potential consumers in the way each review feels constructed to convey a particular game's overall experience rather than being enslaved to the typical bullet point checklists most consider the one true metric for reviewing games.  I can actually veg out and binge all the content here without feeling disgusted with myself in the same way I feel when smashing too much junk food!
Kentucky Route Zero,"lmao @ all the dumbasses in the comment section calling something pretentious just because they have the mental capacity to ponder something abstract. just say this kind of art isn't for you, you don't need to shit on something designed specifically for someone who can appreciate it just because you aren't that person."
Kentucky Route Zero,"What was that game called...
It's on the tip of my tongue."
Kentucky Route Zero,This is beauty. Thank you!
Kentucky Route Zero,"As someone who just finished this game, it definitely is not for everyone. However, those who enjoy deep themes, ambiguous interpretation, and experimental styles of story telling will very much so appreciate this work of art."
Kentucky Route Zero,Wonderful review! Loved the theme as it fits so well with the game.
Kentucky Route Zero,I don’t know but I like cheese
Kentucky Route Zero,"I haven’t played this game, so I have no idea if what I’m saying is correct, but it seems like this game is the equivalent of going to a modern art museum and looking at some truly awful painting, while telling yourself that this is art so you will feel cultured and intelectual."
Kentucky Route Zero,Beautiful tribute to the game
Kentucky Route Zero,Kentucky Route Zero is a very boring video game but it is a very entertaining something else.
Kentucky Route Zero,Man this is definitely your worst review dawg
Kentucky Route Zero,I....I think this is the best review ever created.
Kentucky Route Zero,"Meh. A little ""artsy"" for me to stick to the end (the review I mean; not the game)"
Kentucky Route Zero,"If we were better at naming things, we might call kentucky route zero an easy platinum"
Kentucky Route Zero,I understand half as much of this half as well as I should like and I like less than half of this half as well as it deserves
Kentucky Route Zero,Amazing review
Kentucky Route Zero,"So basically Kentucky Route Zero is an experience where you go through a bunch of sets in a pre-determined order that never changes, the general plot touches deep subjects but never delves on them for a long time, the story is linear but it gives you opportunities to input things that will not affect the game's world, but will effect your experience with it. The goal here is to experience it, not to beat it. Then you take that experience, look back at that experience, consider the whys and hows, and finally determine what it all says about you.
That, to me, signifies a piece of art.
Kentucky Route Zero is a piece of art that gives you an experience most likely no one else will have.

By the way, I never touched the game and probably never will. I prefer a good power-fantasy over self-exploratory artwork. So feel free to ignore this comment."
Kentucky Route Zero,Watching David Lynch films lately?
Kentucky Route Zero,i actually paused the video and went and watched the 1985 death of a salesman xD. no regrets there
Kentucky Route Zero,"Personally, I though this game was a little too up its own ass to be enjoyable. It looks really pretty, though"
Kentucky Route Zero,"Finally got around to playing this. Most unique ""game"" I've ever ""played"". I would say it's more like an interactive theater production. Very glad I took the time."
Kentucky Route Zero,I havent played kentucky route zero yet and you say you dont play the game. Im derived to think maybe the game plays you. Are you even reviewing the game? The game is reviewing you and maybe your ability to do so. Am i about to buy this game or is the game buying me? Either way im sold.
Kentucky Route Zero,"I’ve lived in Kentucky my whole life, of course I’ve gone to other states for week or more periods of time on vacations and such but I’ve never lived out of state. I’m about to go off to college for music ed and musical theatre, and I’ve had this sense of nostalgia for this damned state, and this game seems...I don’t know, I feel like if I play it I’m giving this state it’s last hurrah, giving my high school theatre experience it’s last goodbye. It’s weird I can’t describe exactly what this game makes me feel , but because of that I’ve been putting off playing it, I’m picking it up cause of you, maybe this’ll make me feel a bit better during quarantine, thank you"
Kentucky Route Zero,This was an amazing video to watch. Thank you
Kentucky Route Zero,Whats the name of the second artist with the TVs i think im spelling his name wrong?
Kentucky Route Zero,I love how you reviewed this game i cant wait to play it.
Kentucky Route Zero,"""A mystery is when you have too much information and don't know what's relevant.""  I see what you did there. So, do I separate the footage with editing software? If I successfully edit the relevant parts together, do I get a prize?"
Kentucky Route Zero,That’s a real long roundabout way to say “pretentious”
Kentucky Route Zero,Kentucky Fried Chicken is an American tragedy*
Kentucky Route Zero,"I LOVED this ""review""... but I need more info on the game itself. Cheers, regardless! Different strokes for different folks... especially when it comes to this game it seems. Later!"
Kentucky Route Zero,This is making me hate the game.
Kentucky Route Zero,"Such a good review, I'm so happy to ever have discovered your channel back in division days. I have just finished this game, because I saw you made a video on it and it has been on my wishlist for years. Checking back for the review, it delivered the feel of the game so well and yes rating bar reflects that: it's not for everybody, I'm just glad you brought light to it. Keep it up man, it's hard to find such polished, diverse and *different* channel like yours, hats off."
Kentucky Route Zero,"If I were better at naming things, I would be able to tell you what this is the best of. But for now, let's just say this is the best game review I've seen."
Kentucky Route Zero,12:43 The PS2 opening Splash screen.
Kentucky Route Zero,You talk alot and i dont get the wiser about this game.....
Kentucky Route Zero,"I have played Kentucky Route Zero up until Act III. So I will go back to playing the remaining acts now that it's finished and tbh, there isn't really a better way to describe other than this video review tells you. If I or anyone else describe in simplistic terms of what the game is about, then chances are that it would push everyone away, because it isn't so much a game as it is an experience. 
I would say that there are intervals of small puzzles, so it's not entirely out of the gaming sphere we came to know. It's just more of a surrealistic storytelling experience that have corporativism , humanism and...even america as its themes.  
Great OST and everything feels like a trippy experience with some really badass settings in this universe btw. Really worth checking."
Kentucky Route Zero,Fancy saying “if we were better at naming things” another few times? I don’t think I got your point.
Kentucky Route Zero,"This video must objectively be called a review, but if we were better at naming things, we would call it something else"
Kentucky Route Zero,"A perfect fit. A pretentious reviewer, reviews a pretentious ""game."""
Kentucky Route Zero,"Game took so long to be completed, that by the time it was finished, I didn't even bother playing."
Kentucky Route Zero,jeez everyone who disliked this video clearly does not understand
Kentucky Route Zero,what
Kentucky Route Zero,"Obviously the ""art"" in this game inspired you...but as much as I usually like your insights I think you stuffed your head pretty far up your own ass this time.  I feel like this review was written by a combination of James Portnow (extra credits) and Squidward."
Kentucky Route Zero,"Really, really enjoying this review. It's like regular car reviews but for games."
Kentucky Route Zero,Looks like David Lynch's first video game. Sign me up!
Kentucky Route Zero,"What?  Fools being fools!  I don't know why people are weirded out by this.  This was one of my favorite SkillUp reviews, hands down.  I'm oddly surprised and disappointed by the audience's reaction."
Kentucky Route Zero,Brilliant! You're an excellent writer.
Kentucky Route Zero,"As someone who ""played"" and loved this ""game"" I totally got what you were going for with this review. This was probably the most creative and interesting review I've seen in ages, great job."
Braid,"Hey Tim, you can actually control time like you had time powers?"
Braid,"I never played Braid, but I love how they use the rewind feature in so many ways"
Braid,How did you manage to catch the princess at 13:35?
Braid,"this game released 4 years after Cave story yet claims to be the only thing that ever existed….
Cave story is deep without the creator bragging about it online btw"
Braid,"Idk man, Soulja Boy told me this game got no point"
Braid,such a good game
Braid,"Excellent video!
But seriously ...  How the HELL is Tim in the Princess's room WITH HER?  13:35   Someone's got to know this?"
Braid,I knew Juliet Delos for 30 years before she died. We never had a single conversation.
Braid,My completed puzzles don’t show correctly from the hub world: they’re cut off. Anyone else experience this? Not sure if it’s an ultrawide issue or not
Braid,"I've been looking for this game, I've played it a while back and forgot what it was called. I love it."
Braid,You should have a spoiler section. I stopped at 8:00
Braid,I really like your thumbnail art
Braid,13:30 wait wait wait wait wait how the hell is tim in the princess' room with her?
Braid,"I wanna see the script of this video and ctrl+f search for the word ""time"""
Braid,Never heard of it...
Braid,"Great vid, very well done. I think you did the game justice. Liked and subscribed"
Braid,Why do you say everything twice?
Braid,10:54  how ?  i have no enemy for jump :(
Braid,Support comment 90
Braid,This games soundtrack has been on constant rotation in my life since I first played it. Downstream is pure bliss.
Braid,It's probably been 10 years since I played Braid. Never beat it but such a great game. 1 or 2 puzzle pieces that were just too big brain for me.
Braid,something something atomic bomb
Braid,"I bought this game on Humble a long, long time ago, but it never interested me until now. I'll definitely check it out now. Thank you."
Braid,"So I've been playing this game on and off for over 10 years, give ally completed it today after year of getting frustrated and giving up. Now you're telling me there are stars..."
Braid,"так грустно, но легко становится, когда понимаешь что не один помнишь эту игру"
Braid,Matpat should do a theory on the story
Braid,"Time meant nothing, never would again."
Braid,Who's here after watching TENET?
Braid,"Hey all, Jirard here"
Braid,Crazy because a remake was just announced lol
Braid,"Awesome video!
Pleeeeaaaase play Witness!"
Braid,I haven’t played Braid but I have heard consistently good reviews of it. This was by far the best review I’ve seen. Thanks for sharing!
Braid,I bought this game back in the day and hated it. Still don’t understand the love people have for it.
Braid,Braid and FEZ: Two game experiences I have never found again.
Braid,"I just realized that this subtitle is pretty wrong, isn't it? Time means everything in this game. It's what it's built around."
Braid,Jirard will never play The Bouncer.
Braid,Braid's story is actually about the atomic bomb. Its brilliant.
Braid,So I played this game but for some reason I never did the last level I started it so I know the twist but I never finished it? It may have been that I got frustrated and gave up I can’t actually remember.
Braid,The witness completionist episode when?
Braid,"How have I never heard of this game? I love puzzles, I love stuff that involves time be it travel or manipulating, I love popular indie games Shantae, Shovel Knight, and undertale which also have retro ascetics."
Braid,"The great thing about you, Jirard, is that your love for videogames always comes across in each and every one of your videos. Even if you don't like the game that much, you can still find things you enjoy about it. I never knew about Braid when it came out, so this has made me consider digging it up and having a go."
Braid,"This game was the first stone that kicked of the landslide of my game design interest. It made me realize games are art pieces if intended (and sometimes unintended). This game showed me how games and gaming tropes can be used to tell a story, and engage the player in a transcended manner. Really happy that you give this a showcase. It's a great games simply for how it weaves the story and immerses the player."
Braid,"For all future videos, anytime you’re down because of comments or current events, do yourself a favor and look at your subscriber numbers and likes. The silent majority love your content; your positivity and enthusiasm is what your viewers love. Don’t forget that man :)"
Braid,"And now a word from our sponsers...

Braid - Shadow Legends"
Braid,He should do Mario and liugi paper jam
Braid,Freddie Mercury reference?
Braid,"Do Dying Light, prepare to throw a controller out the window if you don't like first person platforming."
Braid,How much time did the intro take to make.
Braid,"I don’t pay for patreon, and it’s not a metroidvania but I really want jirard to complete any rhythm heaven game"
Braid,"Nice work on this! 💪 

I had Braid music on a youtube intro and it got demonetized. Did you have any problems?"
Braid,"Thanks for covering this.
This game melted by brain back then."
Braid,I feel like you should put a score on the games you review but it's probably just my personal preference
Braid,"Dude, one of the biggest GAMING EVENTS is happening this weekend! GMTK Game Jam on @t. How come I've never seen YouTube reviewers try to participate and review the top games devs make at these events. They're not AAA or major Indie games, but they represent the true core of the gaming community. They are young upstart future developers that make the top games that are sold on Steam and in GameStop later. I'm not saying that you should review for every game jam, but maybe for big events like GMTK and Global Game Jam. The thought of having reviewers like yourself making a presence there motivates young devs to pursue their dreams in game development. Game Jams are the most neglected part of the general gaming community. If you can make an episode highlighting some of the top games coming out of that jam, it would be awesome. Plus, it can become yearly content for you."
Braid,Can you guys play infamous
Braid,Who else is waiting for him to cover Mega Man X5 or DKC: Tropical Freeze?
Braid,Make belief reborn!
Braid,"""I even considered doing this entire episode in reverse""



*Ska music plays*
""Oh no, Susie's gift!"""
Braid,"Jirard, I have some suggested games that you should complete in future videos.

Astral Chain
Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas
The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask
Freedom Planet
Sleeping Dogs
Sonic Lost World
Sonic the Hedgehog CD

Donkey Kong 64 (New Game Plus)
Jet Force Gemini
The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword
Perfect Dark
Jet Force Gemini
Ty the Tasmanian Tiger
Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando
Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal"
Braid,"Hey, Jirard! Can you please complete the original Metroid for the Nintendo Entertainment System? You should really check out the first game that started the Metroid franchise!"
Braid,Can someone on the patron tell him to complete infamous please
Braid,Can you complete infamous
Braid,Can the next game to be completed be Mario strikers charged
Braid,You have to stand around for 2 hours to get a star? Hard pass.
Braid,"That problem with layers, is that you have to peel back the previous layer to get to the next one, discarding any meaning or purpose the previous layer had."
Braid,Maybe this is too deep?
Braid,I kinda expected and with this ... complete it. @1:42
Braid,Do Life is Strange next!
Braid,"Jigsaw? Banjo?......Saw III?

Apologies for the bad pun"
Braid,"The moment you said that a Star was missable by completing the 3rd puzzle, I instantly became uninterested in this game.
Making any content whatsoever missable without a full and proper warning to the player is extremely bad game design."
Braid,"I get that the game is an acclaimed masterpiece, but as someone who never played it, this video doesn't prove it. Just repeating how artistic it is doesn't really show it to me: it just makes me think the game is pretentious."
Braid,Am I the only one who can't stop thinking about BRAID SHADOW LEHENDS?
Braid,For once a game here I don't know
Braid,"Interesting. Shame you had to avoid spoiling the story, since that's one of the more interesting parts. I liked hearing about how some of the stars were solved. I like knowing about the fancy tricks & puzzles in games."
Braid,do the last of us part 2!!
Braid,"The Company of Myself is another great game about time. It is a browser game where, through repeated tries, you help yourself get through puzzles."
Braid,"It turns the act of jumping on their heads... erm... on its head.

I was totally hoping you'd say that, Jirard ㅋㅋ"
Braid,"Gerald obviously used a walkthrough to 100% this game. How else do you find out about the moving cloud? So then, what's the point? If you are using a walkthrough, you're essentially cheating."
Braid,Time is ever marching onwards beyond reality but eternally linked to reality. When you try to understand the complexity of Time and reality it is always harder to connect it to something inside everyday life.
Braid,"So... 2 hours waiting on a cloud +
2 or 3 speed runs at an average of 50 ish mins =
Nearly 4 or 5 out of 9 total play hours.

So Jirard is so good at game that everything else only took him 4 or 5 ish hours?

Dayum!"
Braid,"I use him in Super Meat Boy lol, he's OP"
Braid,"Really, really liked the thumbnail for this one. That thoughtful, uneasy pose says a lot without saying anything."
Braid,Complete Baba Is You
Braid,What is this games story about.
Braid,"If you liked Braid, please play Outer Wilds (2019). One of the best games I've ever played."
Braid,"Him:""Hey all...""
My mind:""sCøØţ HəŘə"""
Braid,"This was a surprisingly poetic episode of Completionist. I appreciate how much love you showed not just the gameplay, but the tones and themes behind it. I agree that this game became such an iconic piece of gaming history, it's always stuck with me as a pretty important title. Thanks for the nostalgia trip back in time. I think I need to replay this one."
Braid,Had a great TIME here
Braid,Honestly when braid came out I thought it was overrated.
Braid,You should complete blasphemous!
Braid,Hipster Mario is a fantastic game.
Braid,"What game is that? 2:55. (Found it, it’s ‘Semblance’, didn’t see the name first..)"
Braid,a platforming classic that everyone should play if you ask me
Braid,1:13 gamer
Braid,Please try Journey to the Savage Planet 🙏🏼
Braid,you should do the witness next
Braid,"Wow, the creator of Braid likes puzzles that require waiting for hours at a time.


Because there are several in The Witness."
Braid,This is 370th game
Braid,Wait... Stars!!! I need to play Braid again
Braid,Spirit tracks next please. K thanks ❤️

Braid,"Why so much hate here, chill out guys fucking hell."
Braid,"Dudes, slow down on the McNuggets. You get filled with estrogen and you die earlier."
Braid,But... what about Soul Calibur 4?
Braid,ACTUALLY after like an hour when i FINNALY solve the puzzle i feel stupid not smart -_-

Omori,"ive been wanting to show this game to my parents but they’re very unaccepting, they’d probably say “oh that’s too mature for you even though you’re a teenager” what do i do"
Omori,This has EARTHBOUND like vibe. That was the best old game I have ever played.
Omori,(:
Omori,this channel needs more subs
Omori,its not easy to play this game after hades and dead cells
Omori,"i already 100% the game and even kinda speedrunned it to get the final 2 archivements lefts some time ago.
Waite 6 years for it but due to the hype i expected to be dissapointed with the game as ""it not gonna be what i wanted"" , boy was i wrong , the game is a blast , never i had a experience like that before.

things to get into account:
-go into the game blind 
-learn about the emotion system fast to win fights without having to wait 10 turns for ""release energy"" .
-the game last for 20hr but since there are different routes it can go into 40hr , i had to go 90hr because of the archivements  since i made mistakes a few times.
-there are a few softlocks but most of them are in the ""post game"" eske part of the game."
Omori,what's the background music called
Omori,"Best Knife Users 
1st Omori
2nd Madotsuki
3th Chara"
Omori,"many of my friends are praising this game and i really want to look into it, but i’m personally not good at handling heavy themes such as these due to personal issues. i feel like it might impact me negatively, but i also want to see how these themes are depicted in the game."
Omori,"We fans have to keep up with spicy contents, arts, and memes to combat the amount of despair this game actually has"
Omori,"Huh, so it has an emotion mechannic sort of like the JoJo SNES game."
Omori,"If i have a bad mental health and am aswell afraid of death, should i be touching this game? Ive been looking forward for it ever since the trailer 6 years ago. But I just dont know if i can handle it"
Omori,"I like that we both gave it a 9 out of 10 and are both the first things that come up when you search ""Omori Review"""
Omori,I cried so hard at the ending
Omori,My heart cried seeing the good ending duet part and all those moments when a character cries and everyone else cheers them up always makes me cry inside... The only thing I less like is the sometimes too slow paced parts like when your in the dreamworld. The fights in the dreamworld get very tedious to watch while the real world feels more faster and more progressive. If it took a bit less time and a bit more fast paced i would give it a 10/10
Omori,i have never cried harder than i did when finishing this game
Omori,"No other game has made me feel such deep, existential dread like this game did. It's a masterpiece, but it's absolutely NOT for everyone. You need to take those trigger warnings very seriously and know that you are stepping into something darker than you can imagine."
Omori,My new favorite game. Related a little bit too hard on some things ngl
Omori,nice uwu
Omori,"I recently finished the game (being part of the ""waited for six years"" gang) and this was an experience that was worth the wait. 

Tip:
It's best to play this game blind."
Omori,"I've always loved jrpgs, especially Earthbound and Pokemon so this was an instant pick up from me and hoh boy, one of the best decisions I've ever made."
Omori,Omg this looks cute af!! I love the style so much. Thanks for reviewing it as I would’ve never heard of it otherwise.
Omori,"It's a pity the characters and world are so visually boring, not to mention it's uninteresting story topics (depression again? really?) because it ""seems"" like an interesting game, but I'd rather just replay it's inspirations."
Omori,"Heyo!I just want to know if this game is kind of a horror game, It seems like something I would love but I can easily get stuck at points in games because of fear, so if there's any disturbing imagery or jumpscares, please let me know"
Omori,"Finally, a review for this game."
Omori,Thank you for reviewing it! Great review.
Omori,I really hope this comes to Switch! Wonderful review!
Omori,"so for the sequel, is it an undertale situation with a name like MOORI"
Omori,Wow the art style is so flipping good. I just can't get over how good it looks !
Omori,I'm enjoying this one quite a bit! Nice review!
Omori,I've had my eye on this for years now! So glad it lived up to the hype
Omori,"This was a wonderful review.  As much as I'm not a fan of rpg's like this, I kind of want to check it out now lol"
Omori,First person to make a review I see
Omori,Thanks for reviewing this title!
Omori,"I feel like I've deleted a million comments in regards to people either wanting to find free copies of the game or looking to torrent it. 

The making of this game and everything brilliant within it, is the result of hard honest work. Hard honest work that requires payment as compensation, because that's the way the world works. This game is not the work of a huge studio. There is not investors who take the hit rather than the developer. If you play this game for free, then you are actively stealing from the person who worked so hard to bring you a beautiful piece of art. 

I personally think you have no right to play and enjoy it if that is your attitude."
Omori,thank you for such a beautiful review of my favorite game I’ve ever played.
Omori,"I have to be honest, this game changed me. Everything about it was beautiful to me and really had me look inwards after seeing the representation of mental illness. I highly suggest this game and will sing praises about it for years to come."
Omori,"Nah bro this game isn't for me, i tried playing omori, i played it like 80 minutes and then i just dropped it because it bored me"
Omori,its_jawsh
Omori,Just got done with Citizen Sleeper yesterday.. meh. Starting Omori tonight. I have high hopes
Omori,It has all the things I want in. Unique indie rpg
Omori,I’v been seeing this game everywhere now should i buy it? It’s 30$ tho..
Omori,I could make a longer video on why NOT to play omori
Omori,"You said that you sometimes got lost and didn’t know where to go, if you talk to Mari she’ll tell you where to go next"
Omori,"In 2020, during the pandemic, I had an idea for an rpg game that I've been planning since (i still have to learn to code). Then, I was inspired by undertale, now, by other games such as Oneshot, deltarune, and fnaf. And I'm ready to give Omori a try and expand my videogame culture. Upon seeing the crayon drawings for the first time I knew that this game was special, I think i wasn't wrong."
Omori,"I dont know why, but i cant understand ""sad"" related emotions
I dont know when i feel like it, i cant understand why people feel like that, i can barely understand why i feel sad some times
I feel like im luky, but extremely dumb at the same time
Funny thing is this game scares me just because i know something is wrong more than the game itself beignterrifiying"
Omori,"everyone's talking about the game so I want to try omori, thanks!"
Omori,Nice review. I am getting a physical copy of this game for my NSW because of this video. Thank you.
Omori,"watched this video, decided to buy it , loved it"
Omori,"“Spoiler free”, shows a fight with Pluto. Thanks, bud."
Omori,gonna buy it soon!!
Omori,"Heard about this game & how remarkable it was for years, so I was excited when it came to the Switch. I bought it a few days after it released but still have yet to play past the first 10 mins…because whenever I sat down to play; something always seemed to happen that made me reluctantly put it down. 

Also think I may be a bit nervous 😅 as silly as that is to say. But I think this game is going to rip into my heart (especially after hearing what was said about it by many fans)"
Omori,"This Video helped me make up my mind if i should get it.
Basil was reason 1
this video is reason 2
(in rpg maker what madlads😭😭)"
Omori,"I knew it was about a kid with depression and as someone who struggles with depression, I was cautious before buying it, I think I will next time it goes on sale and thank you, it was you video that made me want to play it
(I’m aware it gets very heavy and are planning on playing it with a friend)"
Omori,"""It tells a story of a child going through depression""
*_leaves video_*"
Omori,"at first I thought it would be boring cause I lost the objective
but now you said it I will probably play it later"
Omori,Me watching this video so I can give arguments to my friends to play it
Omori,I got omori recently and have enjoyed every moment I've played so far
Omori,"My dear NETRO, do you even know how emotionally calm and beautiful you made us be another step closer to decide that this game is an absolute incredible experience? Thanks to you, I‘m closer to really deciding this, as I haven‘t played psychological horror before, I was unsure if I should turn into an emotional „mess“ because of the drama I‘ll experience here, as it seems. Have a great day and stay this special person you are.✨"
Omori,I wanna play it but I'm broke so unless sombody wants to give me money I aint buying it
Omori,"Told my friend who are obsessed with omori for some reason that it seems interesting, and that I might play it then they go ahead and spoil the entire ass thing against my will. Dunno what I expected of them, but even though I know most of the game, is it still worth a play?"
Omori,Omori or halo infinite Hmmm
Omori,"Well i know the story of omori without buying it, i bought it today but i dont know if i refund it or not cuz i know the story."
Omori,"Awesome review!! Finished this game a few months ago, still thinking about it today"
Omori,QUESTION! Can I play Omori offline?
Omori,I am buying this on the switch I wanna get it so bad
Omori,"thank you, i will now send this video to all of my friends who have not played omori (aka all my friends)"
Omori,abt to send this to my grandparents so they let me get omori on ps4
Omori,Me:*Patiently waiting to get my parents buy it*
Omori,"[SPOILER FREE THOUGHTS/REVIEW ON OMORI]
bro i swear to god people be sleeping on omori, it really isnt getting the attention it deserves. I get that its a semi-popular game but *damn* its still underrated considering how good the art-style, ost and story of the game is, and thats still not mentioning all the little details that make the game feel so much more alive, and all the ways omori immerses you in its world and story, genuinely making you sympathize with every character, which makes the ending(s) of the game so much more powerful, emotional and satisfying than any other video game i’ve played so far. I really cannot recommend it enough to people that haven’t experienced this masterpiece, avoid spoilers at all costs, and enjoy it at its fullest."
Omori,"Oh, Omori is just something else, even after a year I feel like OMORI is the best game I've ever played and I still feel emotions similar to what I felt a year ago, when I listen to music from OMORI or watch videos related to it. I'd really like to play it and a few other games in 5 years in order to experience it all again and see the difference between my perceptions of it then and before.
There are games, movies, books, stories in general that hold a special place in our hearts, make us experience many different emotions and give us the opportunity to experience something we would never have experienced. And I'm thankful to OMORI for being one of those stories."
Omori,remind me of earthbound
Omori,"6:58

Hot damn. If the art style in this scene isn’t a reference to the Monogatari series, I don’t know what is."
Omori,"That one video about the game having an easter egg if you name SUNNY ""Omocat"" was enough to get me hooked up. That was probably weeks ever since OMORI came out. Anything similar to Undertale or Deltarune is automatically a win for me. I made a PSA inspired by the game as an assignment and I hope others would be interested in it."
Omori,It seems interesting but there's no way I'm buying that for 28 dollars!
Omori,When you can't afford it
Omori,"woahh i didnt know it was made with rpgmaker! my most favorite game, pom gets wifi, is made with it too aaa how cool"
Omori,Too bad that it cost money
Omori,Underrated!!
Omori,I was wondering why people love this game
Omori,This is definitely not an 8-bit game. It’s more like a 32 or 64 bit game. Also if you want a great RPG with an amazing soundtrack and a story that pulls your heart strings while still being fun and charming I recommend playing Mother 3. That game also heavily inspired Omori so give it a shot. Promise you won’t regret it.
Omori,"I want to play this game, but I think I'm not good with horror"
Omori,"I just bought this game on sale on Steam. I was initially interested because of the mystery behind the story, but after watching the preview videos and noticing how similar it is to Earthbound gameplay-wise, I knew I had to play it. I'm glad you made this video spoiler free because while I want an idea of what to expect, I also want to go in mostly blind."
Omori,"I think Omori will forever be one of my favorite games. I love RPG maker horror games, some of my favorites are one of the best games I’ve ever played. I had dropped the game for a little over a year because I got bored during the long ass prologue, but I picked it up and spent 10 hours the first day and then 15 hours the next day, I absolutely could not get off the game. The game is made so well, the music, the vivid colors, the battle mechanics and it was just so amazing. 10000000/10"
Omori,"when you mentioned undertale at the end, i think a good way to describe it is that while they are very different games they share many of the things that make them good. (great soundtrack, endearing characters, emotional story, etc.) this was a great review and you explained the game well without spoiling it. i bet some people played omori from this :D"
Omori,I'd play if i had money to buy it
Omori,Waiting on the Switch release.
Omori,"I've been having a lot of trouble getting into games recently. I work a lot, I don't have more than a few hours a week where I can sit with a game guilt-free. This is the first game in a few years I've been able to sink into and let the world melt away. Would recommend to absolutely everyone."
Omori,Why can't we play it on a PS3 or a PSP or PS Vita or PS2
Omori,First of all get a haircut
Omori,"Do I need to worry about killing a enemy or is that not possible?
And I saw something about space and being eaten by a whale uhhhhhh (I will still play)"
Omori,"I really want to play it, but I'm just worried it'll be too scary for me..."
Omori,"This is, what I wanted undertale to become one day, and to be honest with you all?, this game, it’s flawless. It was an absolute joy to play, but also a burden on the soul 🥲 how something so innocent seeming, could twist and churn you like a merciless nightmare, it’s everything an rpg should be. Dramatic, peaceful, chaos. 👏"
Omori,"I thought when he said ""It's similar to..."", he was gonna say Earthbound. It's funny how you mentioned Undertale but not Earthbound when it's the inspiration to both of them."
Omori,"Mid watching youve said that you got lost and didnt know what to do next. Mari exists for that, you can always walk up to her and she'll tell you what to do."
Omori,Ahhh I was extremely excited cause the videos I watched on it seemed so scary and emotional 😭 but I don’t have the equipment to play it (I only have an iPad and phone)
Omori,"thanks for the spoiler free edition, been wanting to show this to my strict parents."
Omori,thank you for this
Omori,Reason why i played omori: BASIL
Omori,First video of yours I have watched and I enjoyed the quality and editing. I also liked how you talked to me facing the camera. I might subscribe
Omori,IM ASKING FOR A NINTENDO SWITCH LITE FOR CHRISTMAS AND I CANT WAIT TO PLAY THISSSSSS
Omori,Wasn't this supposed to be an horror game?
Omori,The production on this “Why you should play” series is fantastic. Great work
Omori,"Seeing all the passionate players of this make me want to give it a shot. I'm about to play it on my new LG 38"". WISH ME LUCK"
Omori,i would. IF IT WAS ON MOBILE
Omori,Im watching this because the girl Im dating was fangirling over it and it got my attention to it
Omori,i can’t play game!!!! I have a garbage mac!!!!!!!
Omori,"thats it, im buying it"
Omori,Ok sold. Downloading now
Omori,damn dude you sound depressed you okay bro?
Omori,"Thanks a lot for this video, what i prefer in this game is the details. Everything has a meaning and is connected, i already saw 3 playthrough of the game and a lot of secrets videos yet i'm sure i don't know half of it. I also love the incredible art style, super cute and original"
Omori,8:29 That scene in the Junkyard gets me every time
Omori,"I started playing.. and till now i'm finding quite boring, it seems like a very generic RPG...
The only real good part was Sunny alone in his house with no lights, that was creepy
And the white space parts are kind interesting too

But... gosh... the normal gameplay, like the hide and seek on the playground, it's so ZzZzZzZ...

I hope it gets better"
Omori,"I really can't make up my mind on this game. 
It looks beautiful, and I've avoided a lot (but not all) spoilers, so I thought the game looked fun and wanted to watch someone play it to see if I liked it. However I could barely get to episode 4 because the game seemed so boring and repetitive. Also I don't really enjoy how battles work, but at least they are avoidable. 

I love to immerse in a good story with good characters, but what I know is just so off putting that I'd rather read the wiki article on the story.

I'm conflicted if I should buy the game, since from what I've heard the story is really good..."
Omori,"Unfortuantely i have already seen a spoiler video of it, with the ending with it :/ i am not really sure if i still wanna try the game or not since i now know what is going to happen in the end."
Omori,"Very good review! I appreciate how you didn't spoil anything, but still managed to describe the game in depth.
I really liked Undertale, so I'll be buying it!"
Omori,great quality video man
Omori,"my friend has omori, he showed me it and it supposedly “horror” themed. i really want to get the game but the game is expensive $20. if it were free, for sure id play!"
Omori,are you tellin me this man finished a 40 hour game (including hikikomori) in 3 days?
Omori,Saying this game is too similar to Undertale is ignoring both Undertale and Omori were inspired by Yume Nikki and MOTHER.
Omori,"Really lovely video that doesn't give away spoilers, there's no
HEY ONLY 0.000001 PERCENT OF YOU ARE SUBSCRIBED GO HIT THE LIKE BUTTON or clickbait.
Relaxing, calming, and very nice.
Thanks for the video -you're really underrated."
Omori,I think that omori looks better than undertale
Omori,"My sister wants to play this game with her friend and I watch a bunch of reviews to know what’s up for my sister haha
Honestly seems like an amazing game and maybe I’ll play it for myself"
Omori,"I just wanted to say, I found this useful in making my mind up on buying this game... but more than that, I really appreciated the calm, introspective, slightly melancholic tone of the video!"
Omori,"Wait, where can you not fast travel to? Deeper well? Blacker space? Haven't played the hikikomori route, but aren't those two mostly just one-time visits?"
Omori,man
Omori,(=
Omori,"yay another video, didn't know how I missed this one"
Omori,"Honestly i discovered Omori through a doki doki literature club comparison post, and I'm goint through it blind. Im 10 hours in and I am HOOKED I don't know if I want to speed through it in one sitting or enjoy it slowly <3"
Omori,This video was fantastic ❤️
Omori,This makes me miss final fantasy 6. I forget how valuable that art style really is and how much we miss it in modern games.
Omori,I agree with everything but this being like Undertale. Omori is so much better.
Omori,"There are a lot of Undertale fan games, I want one where Basil is Flowey 😂, Sunny is Frisk, Aubery is Undyne, Kel and Hero are Sans and Papyrus, etc... you know what I mean xD"
Omori,"I wish the game would blow up like Undertale 😭. It's so so good. I want an influencer to stream it so Omori can become mainstream. Awesome video, I think I can convince my friends with this. It made me feel so many emotions, I laughed, I cried, music made me feel in my feels. The themes the game stand for really resonate with me. 

Spoiler comment: 




So, my sister is actually named Mari. I cried 😭. I can never look at my staircase the same way ever again. If we ever order pizza, *I'M* going down the stairs ;- ; lol."
World of Horror,https://twitter.com/panstasz/status/1448704788808470528 THE DEV IS BACK!!!
World of Horror,"What I like about this game is that I went into it expecting it to be a creepy point and click adventure game. But when the steeamstress room jumpscare happened, I suddenly felt I couldn’t feel safe in the game 😅"
World of Horror,"For everyone, the game still gets updates. We recently got 0.9.99, so dw, it  happens"
World of Horror,"It has since been updated, and is going to be ported to consoles next summer. Looks like it will be finished by next year!"
World of Horror,If Junji Ito wrote a point and click adventure game
World of Horror,Aaaaand the new update is out
World of Horror,"See I see a lot of people saying about this game being 'unfinished', I think it's kinda fine as is. Everything else is just gravy imo"
World of Horror,"THE DEV CAME BACK!!!
Big update is promised before the year os over"
World of Horror,This game really feels like something you'd find on a dusty computer at the back of a big old library surrounded by occult texts
World of Horror,"5:39
Actually, The Ui and the game is based on NEC PC-8801"
World of Horror,World of Horrors is more like an Old Macintosh game from circa 1988-1989 played on one of those wide screen monitors the Macintosh II had available around that time period with aspects from the PC 98 in my opinion and how it rendered graphics Abit too smoothly with some games.
World of Horror,<3
World of Horror,"Good news, everyone!"
World of Horror,"As of about an hour ago, the dev has resurfaced and stated that good news is coming soon!"
World of Horror,Just to let everyone know the dev has come back you can see his post on Twitter
World of Horror,"dev's back, you summoned them"
World of Horror,"Lol I was listening to this in the background until you said, ""Enjoy this cat video!""

I own the game and wondered what's up. I love it as is. I will love it when the updates come too. 

'Dude, needs to take care of home stuff? That's fine by me. I have been there before.

If no updates come, I am happy. If they do? I am happy. Hope he does what he loves."
World of Horror,Love this game im in the discord all the time a shame dev disappeared
World of Horror,I hope the dev is alright and they come back to finish this game. As to be honest it's one of the most unique takes on the genre I've played in years.
World of Horror,"You can have a literal DOG as a party member in this game. It's great. Gets a bit repetitive at times, but I don't mind. It still gave me hours of entertainment."
World of Horror,"JUNJI ITO
HE SAID IT
I AM NOT RAGE THIS VEIDEO
GOOD BOY
YOU KEEP YOUR GENITALS THEIR CURRENT SHAPE TODAY
BISH"
World of Horror,Too bad the game is basically in a state of potentially infinite limbo.
World of Horror,Your fursona is adorable.
World of Horror,"12:53

Hey, stop being reasonable! We're on the Internet, damnit! >:("
World of Horror,Even the unspeakable is an ennemy. oh god how can we beat #@˘&%  with cheeas.
World of Horror,Watching this’ll bed at 1 in the morning. My hand is on an air-soft gun cause I feel  a little safer
World of Horror,This game made me afraid of eels.
World of Horror,"Damn, yeah, this one is a personal favourite of mine. Also first game I bought on itch."
World of Horror,I miss the pre-nerf hammer.
World of Horror,"Remember, Steak Knife is ol’ reliable."
World of Horror,"the dev has been very friendly and talks with the community often about updates.
So I'm pretty sure iot's most likely personal trouble and he didn't run off with the money."
World of Horror,"Japanese horror meets lovecraft? 
So basically junji ito?"
World of Horror,"I just got this game the other day to play with my girlfriend, we love the firsy hour of failure as she doesnt kisten to me"
World of Horror,"I am a little bit personally connected to the situation, and unfortunately the publisher doesn't know what happened to the author, but is currently trying his best to find him and find a way to finish the game eventually. It's really sad because the game is so unique it's already outstanding, but you can't say the review bombing is totally unfair either. 

Thank you so much for this video! Hopefully more people will be able to adjust expectations and enjoy the game for what it is."
World of Horror,Can you imagine if the dev actually died and there was literally no one to tell it to the players?
World of Horror,I hold the belief the dev is coming back with a huge update on the 30th but only time will tell if the game is dead
World of Horror,Does anyone know similar games like WoH?
World of Horror,bloodborne
World of Horror,I hope the dev didn’t abandon it.
World of Horror,"I did not know that the dev had disappeared. That explains things, I have been waiting and waiting for this to come to PS4."
World of Horror,"Please tell me the ""sheep shop"" was a joke XD (Its a corgi)"
World of Horror,"Just beat it for the first two times before ya posted this, what are ya? A psychic?"
World of Horror,"Damn I didn't think I'd see world of horror here, I absolutely love it and I've poured more hours than I'd like to admit into it and it's little mod scene"
World of Horror,I believe the look is supposed to evoke a monochrome PC-98.
World of Horror,"STOP with the red outline, it's a terrible idea. it akes me think that i've watched this video already"
World of Horror,Can confirm. Great game with endless potential but limited content due to it being abandoned.
World of Horror,"I've been a huge fan of this game for years now, the only thing wrong with it is there isn't MORE!
It's extremely well written, the art is great, gameplay loop is fun, it's well balanced and challenging, tons of replay value, 
the soundtrack F U C K S,
It's just so damn good"
World of Horror,I loved this game! Glad you are covering it dude! Love your work
World of Horror,"If you don't already have every game planned out, PLEASE look at Inscryption when it comes out on October 16th. It looks so freaking good"
World of Horror,World of horror reminds me of The Consuming Shadow (if it had better graphics obviously).
World of Horror,"Junji Ito presents:  ""the Uninvited at Sweet Home""
This looks absolutely incredible!!"
World of Horror,"I'm hyped! For this year's celebration cause I'm finally gonna be earning some extra spending money, bills paid for and I'm in a rush to get a good catalogue due to the developements irl.
Finished and hopefully he is just busy cause this looks to be a fun one"
World of Horror,"6:40 game is full of those references, to the point were some people cant figure out if some stuff is a reference or not.
For example: one event has you investigating the office/house of a recent missing folklorist called T. Takeuchi...

The game Forbidden Siren/Siren has a folklore professor called Tamon Takeuchi as one of its playable characters.

The void dimension thing also resembles the final boss area of Siren 1, including a big black pyramid in the middle.

edit: you can also literally run into junji ito :P"
World of Horror,"Saw the title and was immediately in. Currently working on a Dnd campaign where it's basically Bloodborne meets Ghost of Tsushima, so the scares would be very similar"
World of Horror,you should try 7 days to die next
World of Horror,yes! glad you are covering it. I'm still waiting for it to drop on ps4 since I'm a console peasant.
World of Horror,"Regarding the aesthetics of the PC you play on, it could be a combination of various PC-98 variants, which were the most popular desktop in Japan during its heyday."
World of Horror,When are you going to revise your DOOM: Eternal review?
World of Horror,"Oh man, World of Horror is a great game! I always enjoy my time with it, even when I get my ass kicked by RNG. Though I always worried it flew a little TOO close to the sun with respect to the junji ito content and how much is just cut wholesale from his stories, so I wouldn’t be surprised to hear that legal troubles were the cause of the silence. Regardless, I hope it all works out for the developer - it’s a truly unique and excellent style for a game that we’d be poorer not having at all"
World of Horror,"The game does also have a pretty solid modding scene, or at the very least, mod support"
World of Horror,"My brother's friend got me this game, after I kinda got him into Lovecraft (I think) XD awesome!! This month is gonna be a good one! :D

*Post vid thoughts
I miss the days before live-service games and updates were commonplace. Remember getting an expansion pack on a disk? XD"
World of Horror,Shame WOH is abandonware I followed it since it was just a concept and all through the release
World of Horror,Nice cat
World of Horror,So... Junji Ito simulator?
World of Horror,"I remember buying, playing, and really enjoying this. Mechanically simple but very atmospheric. 
... a shame it hasn't updated since I got it..."
World of Horror,This was unexpected woh isone of my favorite games ever and i recently started watching your channel lol
World of Horror,I won't get into specifics but the things I've heard about the dev's situation seem to confirm your suspicion of it being personal trouble. I do not believe he took the money and ran as many have accused. And I hope he can come back when he's ready. God knows I've waited longer for way lesser games.
World of Horror,real life is the biggest horror game.
World of Horror,Bumping up engagement :)
World of Horror,Gimme that ween!
World of Horror,I really wanna play this but im also just not keen on playing an unfinished game in this genre
World of Horror,"Honestly, even unfinished, there are a ton of community content being made, and the game itself is GOOD, like SO FUCKING GOOD dude.
I'm so bored of having played so many reminescences of resident evil or silent hill or anything in between, almost being a walking simulator with a story inbetween, all of them with the same aesthetic approach and, for some reason, all of them in 3D.
I really dig this. As you said it is on it's own, there's not much you can dig from the depths of itchio that kinda matches this one.

I just hope the creator is allright."
World of Horror,"According to Steam reviews (for whatever that’s worth considering how crap they are) a lot of people are saying the developer had stopped due to his house flooded, although I can’t find anything concrete on that (and like Charlatan I don’t want to go too far in finding out)."
World of Horror,"I completely forgot about this game. Meant to play it when it launched but heard it wasn't too complete yet. Now I'm definitely playing it! I know it's strongly Lovecraft influenced, but I can't help noticing that it's full of references and borrowed elements specifically to the Arkham Horror board game. Looks fascinating!"
World of Horror,I have been binging all of your videos the past week and they are wonderful! Your voice and cadence make any topic nice to listen to. I'm so happy for a new video! Have a great day!! 😊
World of Horror,"I have’t played the game since I Finnish all the content, I am keep waiting for the next update"
World of Horror,"NIIIIICE I love this game bro, just wished it was a bit more updated, but I'll have to watch this video asap if it's as good as all of your other vids haha"
World of Horror,Man I can’t wait for a whole month of spookies. Especially cheap spookies for us on a budget
World of Horror,"""World of Whore"" sounds fun."
World of Horror,"The game does certanly look interesting, and it is in my wishlist since a while back. Maybe it's a sign from the elder gods?"
World of Horror,Oh i would loves to play it
World of Horror,first dislike
World of Horror,"as much as it is a shame that the dev is absent, it is also funny thematically for a cosmic horror game developer to disappear out of nowhere for unknown reasons without a trace. hopefully whatever's going on isn't the work of some elder god?

EDIT: Super excited about the fact that the dev is back!!! Glad he took some pointers from his own game and beat back the outer god that was tormenting him."
World of Horror,"This game deserves more recognition, I'm happy that more people are covering it"
World of Horror,Nice video man!
World of Horror,Probs one of my favorite games in terms of art in recent memory. started playing it right before December and I have loved it since. It’s shame it haven’t been updated in so long.
World of Horror,"""Things are going bump in the night at an alarming frequency"" why is that so funny"
World of Horror,"Ah, I love this game, and I’ve been following its development for a while. I’m glad to see more people finally covering it :)"
World of Horror,Cute cat 👍
World of Horror,"Great game, loved playing it, shame everytime i play an early access game the developer just vanishes."
World of Horror,Hello
World of Horror,#justacommentofappreciation
World of Horror,"Hey dude, glad I got to see this early, it was dope as fuck.  Keep doing ya thing!"
World of Horror,"Review starts at 9:14, dont listen to this guy five nights at freddies is epic, and fire emoji."
World of Horror,Horror visual novels hit different you can’t change my mind
World of Horror,The review is fine but your tirade strips all nuance from the games you accuse of being bland. If you're going to give a diagnosis of the state of horror then you should dedicate the time to properly analyze the points you are trying to make. As it stands your arguments are all over the place and your analysis appears flimsy as a result.
World of Horror,"have you ever tried DARKWOOD, its topdown but imo one of the best horrogame ever. because you can defend yourself, but still shit diamonds. it has allmost no jumpscares but the artwork and atmosphere will kill you TRUST ME ;)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S3tmWfFACQ&t=68s"
World of Horror,Mascot horror is a shit genre for children
World of Horror,"Anyone who hasn’t played SOMA, absolutely play it immediately!"
World of Horror,"the scissor lady is an urban legend not folklore.
good video though."
World of Horror,"my dude,  play the fucking board games which this shit based on. This literally eldritch horror with anime tits"
World of Horror,"Oh no! I feel the devil's advocate taking over my fingers as I type!!!!

...FNAF isn't a bad series. Fuuuuuuuck, guess I'm defending THAT now lol. In all seriousness, Fnaf drew all the attention to itself back when it was new. Not because the games were instant classics that stand up to the greats of gaming horror. More because they were different, and (unlike most horror) left you with interesting lore you had to put together yourself, rather than having the lore spoon-fed to you.

Good stuff was coming out around the same time, but like with most gaming genre, amazing horror titles are fewer/farther between these days because of the sheer complexity of game design."
World of Horror,"Eternal Darkness is actually a masterclass in horror game design.  It continually makes you revisit locations, often separated by huge gulfs of time and each location expands reveals more each time you do.

10:08   The 1 bit artstyle of World Of Horror works on a number of levels.  Whille the primary influence is clearly Japanese PC-98 style games, it also feels similar to other early RPG/Adventure hybrids, like Waxworks on the PC/Amiga, or in particular the Classic Mac version of perrenial NES favorite Shadowgate."
World of Horror,I loved this game
World of Horror,"im sure its been suggested a ton of times, but just in case
Darkwood
its pretty rad"
World of Horror,My favourite horror Game is league of Legends
World of Horror,"Dude, you can look around and move in those games, that wouldn't actually work with only 1 stick. 
The PC has an advantage, because the mouse not only has a button, but an optical movement sensor too."
World of Horror,"Not only is making the player helpless not fun, it also makes it hard to make things scarier. If you're scared and nervous the whole time, you get desensitized to it for the most part, save for the occasional threat where you panic for a split second. Giving the player a weapon is almost always better than not because it can make things both funner, and because you can make it uncertain whether or not your weapons are actually doing anything. And then you can take that already inconsistent lifeline and take it away from them for brief periods to make them even more helpless without making it drag on, which can shake up gameplay and scare the player.

Moral of the story: weapons."
World of Horror,"Jumpscares are cheap and overdone, i like to think horror creators are getting bored if they do use them, or just drunk and feeling cruel"
World of Horror,I think my favorite non AAA horror game in the past couple of years has to be Darkwood. That game is so fucking good.
World of Horror,"Hi! Are there other turn-based combat systems that also have this kind of “action bar,” where 3 or more moves are selected and RNG decides which attacks hit?

I’m looking for a game that is turn-based, and you control more than one character in your party. Have fun & thx"
World of Horror,Stalker game series has scared me harder than any other series with its atmosphere.
World of Horror,bruh i love outlast stfu
World of Horror,"I do agree, Spell system is in serious need of balance because they are usually so invalid that people do not even consider them in sucessful runs, this pretty much leaves then useless.

This is a person feeling but i also i feel like their should be definitely a better way to level up, and i am saying this on basis that the best you can do is like 3 or 4 levels, which means you can only stick with one or two usefull stats to make sure you meet the skill check.

it should be a bit higher for sucessfull runs, this is specially true for the higher difficulties because, well without them, removing abilities of player is like you said, is a lazy way to make a player feel helpless, only player's own ability to make it out alive should be gao between him and not being a snack for elder gods."
World of Horror,"So basically they play the board game ""eldritch horror"" and were like ""hey let's make this into a Japanese themed horror game""."
World of Horror,"The year the Internet was invented, 2010?  What?  I had to rewind twice to make sure that is what I heard you say."
World of Horror,Not a fan of the soundtrack. Expected something like Pokemons Lavender town not some battle music altho I guess u do battle... Idk I wanted some ominous creepy soundtrack even silence with some ambience would be great.
World of Horror,"Aaaand the game got pretty much abandoned. It probably has enough content to be worth its price, I had my share of fun with it, but sadly, the Early Access curse strikes again."
World of Horror,"Anyone remember the crypts from Donkey Kong 64 on the 2nd desert world? There was a prompt of getting sniped when failing to finish the puzzle from the crypt where someone said ""GET OUT"" then you get aimed at and shot dead if you don't, well; get out in time. That was easily more scary than resident evil or silent hill games (which I absolutely love) than I had played in my youth."
World of Horror,Horror is not terror.
World of Horror,"The game is on sale on steam and the dev has appeared again on twitter after a long hiatus, great news! Also, pretty good review, you got a new sub :)"
World of Horror,"I liked Amnesia and Penumbra though ):
I thought they were great games, and the ""look around door"" feature I thought was somewhat cool"
World of Horror,MAN that music is good
World of Horror,"great content, fuck new games
Lets go old games"
World of Horror,"There are a bunch of amazing new(ish) horror games about at the moment. Through PS4 sales I've collected a good chunk of the ""must play"" titles and their sequels like Amnesia, Outlast, WhiteDay, Soma, Alien Isolation and more for basically no money.

Sure, there are a bunch of poor imitations available, but the same could be said for pretty much every genre out there.

Edit: Your argument against the ""crutch"" of powerlessness is subjective, I think. I've played games from both camps, and always felt that those which took away my power by removing or limiting my ability to fight back were scarier than those which handed me a way to protect myself.

Depends on your ability to suspend disbelief I reckon. If you can really sink into the mind and body of a protagonist, then you will feel their fear firsthand. Some people seek that fear in a morbid sort of way.

Boils down to different strokes for different folks.

Thanks for the video."
World of Horror,"Sadly, this game is kinda abandoned. It's almost 1 year since the last update."
World of Horror,"4:10 the Penumbra games were made before the amnesia games, and both it and cry of fear are games you can defend yourself in (granted to a limited capacity, but that’s essential for horror)."
World of Horror,"I'm so glad I found your channel! Couldn't agree with you more about the state of horror games and the overdone, lazy jump scares. SOMA is one of my favorite games. It stuck with me long after I played it. The games that really have an impact are the ones with contrast, depth, a blend of mechanics and atmosphere. This is often an unpopular opinion but I think P.T. is so boring.  People act like it reinvented the genre. Agree with you about Outlast as well."
World of Horror,If only they'd update the fucking game
World of Horror,"If you want to play a good horror game and haven't played Darkwood yet, do yourself a favor and do so. Seeing you didn't have a review for it on your channel I thought there's a small chance you just hadn't heard of it yet"
World of Horror,If any of your guys wanna find any other games that feels like 'world of horror' you should check out the YouTube account 'Alpha Beta Gamer'  it has alot of games that are like junji Ito's work.
World of Horror,"Great game, too bad the developer has gone into a long hiatus without saying anything.
edit- he came back, only to dip again."
World of Horror,Loved this review and Idk if you've already done so but I'd love to see what you think of Lake view cabin 1 & 2 and Lakeview Valley!
World of Horror,"hey man, make a video about song of horror, is a great game and i think that you will loved"
World of Horror,"ayyyyyyy cry of fear is pretty dope 
is like silent hill but first person"
World of Horror,"If you are into horror games I urge people to check out Darkwood. It's one of my favourite games ever, let alone horror titles."
World of Horror,LOL the game intro actually scared me.
World of Horror,"I kind-of want to hear his opinion on Phasmophobia, which, while nailing the checkbox of all his critizisms of the genre, is the scariest thing I've ever touched (I am including my X-wife in that list). That one really DID give me phasmophobia for a bit."
World of Horror,Violating the blood oath has cursed the game. The developer has been on hiatus since October.
World of Horror,this is my no. 1 game on steam. i hope the community gets huge for more content
World of Horror,"The moral of the story is:
If you think Amnesia, Punumbra, SOMA and especially Outlast good horror than you are a big ignorant.
That what most people will get, including me because I'm an actual idiot :)
P. S.
I reread my comment and maybe is better that I clarify myself. I get it what you all say, and I hope the situation with horror change. What I was try to say is, do not making fun of people who like this games. Everyone have his own tastes in videogames. Sorry for any misunderstandings, I know the guy in the video is a good person."
World of Horror,"great video but i feel like you can get your point across without dissing other youtubers every 2 minutes. i dont even watch them so im not defending anybody's videos, just got a little repetitive after the first time"
World of Horror,a year later and nothing changed :woozy_face:
World of Horror,Silent hill was the scariest game ever made
World of Horror,The fear and thrill I get from Dahaka chase in POP is much prominent than any mainstream horror games .
World of Horror,I usually agree with pessimists but using midsommar as an example of good horror is funny to me. It’s literally a “group of teenagers getting bamboozled by a generic horror villain” but with makeup to try to convince you it’s something original. It’s a generic creep fest with not much depth other than ‘Swedish cult is creepy’ 0_O
World of Horror,"Sometimes I wish I was twelve and stupid enough to actually enjoy some random idiot dramatically screaming his lungs out on camera over something that isn't even that scary.
As a cynical gamer in his thirties, that stuff annoys the crap out of me. Being old and actually having standards is rough man.
Luckily there are still some actual horror gems around. Thanks for the video Jacob!"
World of Horror,Just gonna put it out there but Midsommar sucked!
World of Horror,Duuude take cry of fear off that list! it is nothing like amnesia you can kill every enemy in the game.
World of Horror,Feels like a digital version of Arkham/Eldritch Horror
World of Horror,This is practically a PC port of the LCG Arkham Horror. I love it.
World of Horror,lol I swear.... you would have been a boss if at 3:45 that was your transition for a Raid Shadow Legends commercial :P
World of Horror,I just randomly bumped into this video and feel in love with your narration and scenario! Instasub!
World of Horror,The door scene in the tutorial made me jump when I first slid it slightly open
World of Horror,midsommar was a disappointment.
World of Horror,FEAR is a solid horror experience. Even if having a gun kinda defeats the horror.
World of Horror,I personally think god tier horror is usually found in non-horror games. They just have a section or something really odd that appears in the game.
World of Horror,Incredible review and spot on essay of the state of horror games. Instantly subscribed
World of Horror,"So, do they like it or not?"
World of Horror,"I agree with the thing of having a way to defend yourself in a horror game, and a good example of this is the two games of The Suffering"
World of Horror,Neon slasher best palet
World of Horror,Cant get enough. I've put 25 or 30 hours in it in like 4 or 5 days
World of Horror,"How dare you throw flak at youtubers

you are kinda half right about them tho"
World of Horror,Buy the game and join the discord. We we have a pretty cool mod scene.
World of Horror,M E G A  M I R K
World of Horror,"This game feels like it took inspiration from yahtzee's old game ""The Consuming Shadow."" It was another game about stopping an eldritch god with a selection of runes you had a limited amount of time to discover, while going through towns that progressively deteriorate, and you have to manage your character's supplies and mental state."
World of Horror,"Darkwood. 

the best horror game to date."
World of Horror,What game scares you the most?
World of Horror,Alien isolation was good. More anxiety inducing but i feel that's definitely a kind of terror.
World of Horror,I liked your comments before the review; they are good food for thought.  I also like how the comment felt more like a statement rather than a mocking rant. World of Horror looks so terrifyling.
World of Horror,want more darkwood and less five nights at freddies
World of Horror,"Your rant at the start couldn't be more right! Most horror is lazy, un-scary crap. I also never finished Outlast, and end up disappointed with most new/current horror titles for the same reasons. Also, I don't care for streamers at the best of times, and the cringe ""reactions"" they do are just nauseating. I know I'm not in their target audience but their phony ""personalities"" are seriously off-putting. Unfortunately that whole symbiotic relationship/vicious cycle is unlikely to end anytime soon."
World of Horror,Smh alien isolation is still pretty good
World of Horror,I thought the first outlast was pretty good...
World of Horror,I alway dislkie the bullshit notion that giving some a gun in a horror game would make the player less scared but then you have a game like silent hill and then they all shut up real fast
World of Horror,"You should play Darkwood. It's a great Top Down Horror Survival game.
It has memorable characters, interesting lore, no cheap jumpscares, the devs are great people.
It's a must play for any Horror enthusiast."
World of Horror,i think F.E.A.R. 1 is prety scary
World of Horror,"Honestly? Amnesia ruined horror games for a long-ass time. 

I cannot be the only person who finds the concept of being helpless and only having one option of 'run away when you fuck up'  or 'you just die if you get spotted' to not be less scary than having the choice of avoiding the spooky thing or confronting it. Mr. X in RE2Make, the stupid shitty model that makes your screen blurry in Amnesia.

They're just obstacles that stop you from doing puzzle until they fuck off so you can do puzzle. That's not scary."
World of Horror,"As a film production graduate, I completely hear you on the state of horror media (and media in general). I've played some genuinely good horror games over the years, but I've really never been that sold on the genre as a whole, especially now. There are *non-horror* games that have scarier or more unsettling moments within them than much of the current fare.

Got to say about films though, I *hated* Midsommar. I thought it was dogshit. :D

But I digress... Three good horror games I have played in as many years are DDLC, No-one Lives Under The Lighthouse... and now World of Horror. All were great fun, and gave me some real unease while playing."
World of Horror,"""You can't have a combat system if you want the player to feel powerless.""
Ahem?
Lost In Vivo, anyone?

...Wait, that one is more of a cult classic, uhh...

Silent Hill, anyone?"
World of Horror,"Iunno if I can agree about the state of horror games, since although the mainstream can fail that expectation, the indie horror game scene has been absolutely killing it, no pun intended! Stuff like the Haunted PS1 series, the Death X Collections, and Faith make me really love what's going on"
World of Horror,Ur a bit too pretentious in the beginning also my experience was that amnesia is dreadfully boring and outlast was genius
World of Horror,Midsommar sucks
World of Horror,This game might also be the closest you could get from an adaptation of the Call of Cthulhu tabletop rpg !
World of Horror,"yeah, that is the rock, he is a cook because you can smell what he is cooking."
World of Horror,"the first Penumbra has combat
and Cry of Fear is basically a horror shooter, so those 2 most definitely don't fit into the list"
World of Horror,"I normally despise elitism, but I hate Pewdiepew so I don't mind."
World of Horror,"I found out about this game from FUNKe, it looks good."
World of Horror,Love love LOVE this game! It is such an experience and if it gets more all the better. Too bad he had far and away the worst entry in Dread X Collection 2. So frustrating
World of Horror,Like i enjoy fnaf because of the concept. The VR now gives me the feeling i had with fnaf 1 as it was new. I enjoy it because of the story and the vibes yeah.....i am gonna be beaten here are t i?
World of Horror,"I can make Slender in less than an hour, so.. yeah (0:"
World of Horror,“We don’t need four more minutes about Lovecraft” BUT ITS FOUR MORE MINUTES OF YOUR CONTENT
World of Horror,"I’d absolutely recommend the convenience store, fantastic short horror game"
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"More importantly, why does this guy sound like James Charles?"
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"luckily now if you own Antibirth+ you can use steam workshop mods to get an encyclopedia inside the game that tells you what every items does, it's genius."
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"Ign:Lacking info is 1 point that willbbe removed
Me:Let me show you MODS AND SITES"
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,yeah lacking info on items is becoming annoying. Pausing letting you read what they can do would be nice. Exepcially in the rogue genre. Risk of Rain 2 has the same issues. You pick up an item and have no idea what it does.
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Pros: easy to learn difficult to master
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Did you put dark souls down for lacking info? Thats the point of the game.
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"Perhaps people should stop naming children ""Isaac""? We don't seem to have the same kind of luck we did in the old days."
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Why take a point off for mystery in the items? Of course you're not gonna know what things do because they are in literal hell!
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,in a mod well i think its a mod there is a boss called the witniss its isaacs dad so i think there is tons of lore in this game 8/10
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,doesn’t cradle you enough 9/10 tf ign you guys are lame
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,So... Ots a 9/10 for lack of info
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Where’s the “Great story” and “Very symbolic” pros?
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,I just can’t get over the ugliness of this game to buy it.
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,So the element of discovery is a con?
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"THIS GAME IS BRILLIANT! 
Tips: 1.) Download a resource app so you can know what every item is and does, along with descriptions of all the characters and enemies!
2.)Always be on the lookout for rocks that are tinted and marked with an X on them, they'll contain precious items, mostly Soul Hearts!
3.)Secret Rooms will be hidden by at least three other conjoined rooms. Super Secret Rooms will not have ANY other rooms conjoined with them outside of the door you entered from.
Lastly, don't give up if the start of a run doesn't seem to be in your favor, you just COULD get some sweet item items on the very next floor! Thanks and HAVE FUN with this endless amazing game!"
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,This is one of my favorite games of all time.
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,I think the game is a little overrated
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,is this the first game or 2nd game?
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,This game is a must buy for anyone and everyone.
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,1001% club bois
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,LOL ''I'm surprised in new items or dungeons after 30 hours'' I JUST CANT
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Finally getting a physical release on the switch. cant wait to double dip
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"I don't understand the 9, why it's so good?"
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"For me, this game is a perfect 10/10"
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Why do people keep commenting 7.8/10? It was given a 9.
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Is this worth downloading its free on PSN
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,lacking info? pls thats like part of the game
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,I love that they just show an entire boss fight as the end sequence
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,This and enter the gungeon are my two most favorite indie games ;)!!!
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,I totally agree that lacking info is a negative. The game would flow so much smoother if I didn't have to pause and Google so many items to remember. lol
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"r u a wizard
YUS"
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"Shouldn't the lacking info be a pro? , having to figure out what made you stronger is amazing, since it adds suprise when you notice issac do something cool...Like daddy long legs, He is one of the best familiars in the game, and his description is ""daddys love"" so it says nothing special, but the effect is special..."
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,wow .. indie hipsters are sick in the head
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,This or the forest?
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,OMFG he never mention that u can play this game co-op but ur partner will take one heart from your stamina . i bet he doesn't know about it
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"cons

gurdy jr bouncy ball bullshit"
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,is this game any fun?
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"This game is better than the Witcher 3, GTA 5, Skyrim, Fallout and every other shitty AAA turd shat out in the past year and a half."
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,For me the lacking info is a pro
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"""Its brutal brutal difficulty""
What?"
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Does this game have a story?
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,a con is lacking info?......THATS A PRO U PEOPLE!!!
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,This is a terrible game! They say difficulty is not punishment but it really is. The game is randomised so much that you will have plays that is just impossible to beat. Controls are those worst kind where you need precision but you continue sliding after you let go of the key.
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,How is that even a point of critique??
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,I love this'll game. It's sooooo addicting
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,I can't pick between shovel knight and this game... What do you guys recommend getting? 
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,no save option. 5/10
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,A 3 minute review of a slightly montone speaker that bored me before I could watch the entire video.
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,That's what makes the game fun when it doesn't give the to much info the creators meant to do that 
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"10/10 I think

"
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Azazel is best character!!!
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"The so called ""con"" is not a bad thing if you think about it."
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,ITS AMAZING!! ...but too hard 9/10 ign
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"He says brutal difficulty, it's not that hard "
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,i actually think the lack of info is a great thing because it adds a sense of mystery
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Probably my favourite game ever
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,IGN = we only create PAID REVIEWS. Dont trust our gaming journalism.
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"This game would be considered unplayable in 1996 but because it's part of the game it's genius?

This truly shows why drugs need to left out of the hands of gamers. This is A 9.0 but almost every big studio game last year was A 7.0?"
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"""The game rarely tells youbwhat an item does"" look up ""learning"" in a dictionary. You learn through experience, not from playing for 5 minutes and beating everything evertime."
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"Idiots: GAHAHAHAHGaahhag! Why didn't this game not get a 10!!!!???!! It's flawless!!!!!

(this is coming from someone who loves the game and has almost all the achievements)"
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Is rebirth more grainy than the original?
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Lol this game is just a reskin of  the legend of Zelda 1.
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,lacking info - 9.0 and playing isaac is about the same as playing left 4 dead and saying 0.0 - too much zombies
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"A full 1 point deducted for ""lack of information"". WTF? The point of a game is to LEARN and EXPLORE not to have all the information at once. What's the point of playing a game that has no secrets or surprises?"
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,a 9.0??!! WTF!
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,LOL this is the most uninteresting review of a game I have ever heard....
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"so... does this game have any form of progression? or is it just, spawn, kill stuff in a box, die and lose everything and then start over? whats the appeal? serious question, not hating."
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,An IGN review I agree on... There's a glitch in The Matrix... 
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"Lacking info? That's what the point of the game is. To find out what each item does, and find synergies for them. Everyone ignore the score IGN gave Rebirth. It's obviously a 10/10."
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,That dude isn't even half-way finished with the game...
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,7.8/11 Not enough preorder - IGN
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,is this a remake or a sequel?
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"Ok, the ""lack of info"" downside is pretty bullshit, what do you do in the game most of the time? Explore and discover, so you are supposed to figure it out so people can have an unexpected result that people might think are either good or bad, take northernlion for example, he took Isaacs heart and didn't Knapp what it was, until he figured out that the heart only takes damage and the body doesnt, they did this so people can have a better experience in the game  discovering good or bad items, making the ""lack of info"" downside , a bullshit reason."
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"The weak info is annoying and I respect that con. I have almost never figured out what a lot of items do because they're literally with description's like ""gross..."" Or ""they grow inside"". Some of them is pretty obvious like ""blood laser barrage"" but still, it's a bit uneven."
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,yeeeeeeaaa
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"I find this game's lack of info rather disturbing lol
Still an awesome game! Wish they could make another one where at least two people can co-op online without sharing hearts"
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"Every freaking video game video I check out, the comments floating at the top of the page are always involving the ""console war"". Xbone players, Sony Ponies, and PC Masterace, I hate you all. Legitimate gamers though, who do not give a shit how others experience their games, to you I tip my hat and extend my hand."
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"A whole entire point off because the game doesn't hold your hand, Thanks IGN."
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,this kids voice
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,This game is easily a 10 for me u just sink and sink hours into it plus so many secrets and collectibles and each run you have awesome feeling cuz u don't know what items ur gonna get
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Great game!!!
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,I hve the exact same issue. In fact during the area where you make a deal with the devil i managed to die just because i picked up the wrong combo of items. If i dont check the wiki i have a fear of picking up items that could make me restart from the beginning. This could be alright if items were less rars but like you said their is a high chance i wont see that item again until hours of gameplay later. Im having tons of fun with it but i wish after you picked up an item it was more in depth as to what it actually did.
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"Good review, I agree this this critique and 9/10 is the right score"
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Really ign lack of info come on give a game a 10 and this one deserved a ten uughh I try to stick up for ur reviews but when u do shit like this its really hard. Lack of information what ass
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"Honestly, console doesn't matter so long as the games are good. I'd rather be playin this than most xbox exclusives"
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"""Lacking info"" like WTF thats actually for someone to discover things... Doing it for your own"

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"Really not interested in playing this at all, but I'll give it a try one vita just for the hell of it. I might just be judging it on its cover too much. "
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Since you're doing old games now. You should do Mr Gimmick next
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"Great great game, i 100% agree with the pros and cons this person said, i have no idea what half of the items does lol"
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Where that 7.8 - too much water is from??
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,No mention of glitched trophies on PS4?
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"I've been playing this on vita, it's one of those perfect handheld experiences especially since you can quit and go back to where you were now. "
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"Newground tier graphics and shitty archaic gameplay with save states.

For the hipster who think they are remotely good at games. "
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"My girlfriend introduced me to the original Issac, so when this came out I got it for her. She loves it!  I can say that is game has taken so much of my time!  And I don't care, love everything about this game. Die mom!!!!! "

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"There seems to be a character you have ""forgotten"" 😏"
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"UberDanger: ""Just listen to my live reaction...""
3 seconds later - ""BLACK ADAM."""
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,I'd like a sequel for Repetance.
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,You describing the plot at the beginning kills me everytime. It really is that simple and it's that crazy
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,and then came repentance...
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,how did you start with the flaming mind mysterious liquid and quad shot is there a creative mode for this game or something?
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"The only extra thing you unlock on hard mode is coop baby’s, which are useless for single players. Unless it’s for the lost, where you get godhead as an unlock for getting all stamps on hard."
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Did he not forget the forgotten?
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,You forgot about the forgotten playable character
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,make a repentance video

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Repentance waiting
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"It wasn’t a glitch that you turned into the lost after doing victory laps, it’s a mechanic"
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Are you waffle time
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"Your opinion was invalidated when you said to avoid Chaos

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Yeah! Reptance time!
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,waiting until he sees the tainted characters
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"So uhhh, after all that, this is late but, the forgotten exists ._."
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,2:45 Was literally admiring your 420 coins AS you bombed them :-(
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"Something about this video was cathartic, this love/hate for how much we play it was too relatable 😭"
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,The forgotten was forgotten. Damn
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Did he forgett the Forgotten
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"Repentance Exists: this guy""F***IN PEICE OF SH**"
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"3:01 Yeah, if your game doesn't crash because you accidentally pressed a button trying to get *to* the boss room."
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Erm... I know that you've beaten this but you forgot one character the forgotten or have I missed it
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,About the 4th rerun becoming that lost is intentional
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Is 450 hours a lot? 😅😅😅
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,You could play a normal run as Isaac then you don't have to grind.
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,repentance?
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"Wakey wakey, time to do repentance."
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,All he needs is good few hours of risk of rain 2. Oh wait
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,SOO UHH REPENTANCE
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"I know you’re working on a modded terraria video, but I would love to also see you make a video on repentance, because it changes the game so much. love your content btw"
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"15:21
Have more then 300hours in Isaac

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Well now repentance is out so now he needs to make another video 😳
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"7:50 not right bucko, you get blue baby if you beat moms heart 10 times"
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,I’ve beaten mom in under 10 min
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,I would love to see a sequel review for repentance.
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,So i needed to beat Greed Mode... to F E E L  C O M P L E T E xD
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"As a 30 hour timmy, im shook"

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,this review is amazing
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Still waiting for the repentance review
Unpacking,A zen game about unpacking. At least we can rest assured there won’t be any woke or gender politics in this bad boy.
Unpacking,It would be so cool if Marzia told you a  recipe a step-by-step in Italian and you had to follow it’s
Unpacking,it's so short (((( delusion
Unpacking,"great game, just wish it was a tad bit longer"
Unpacking,"Described by my 15 year old nephew as ""too stressful"" and he'd rather stick to COD..."
Unpacking,"Everyone: this is so calm, so comforting
Me: *triggered*, why do they have so much stuff!?"
Unpacking,$20 to unpack a virtual house??? I'll just box up my movie collection and unbox it back up.
Unpacking,wtf?
Unpacking,im weird so i’m that person that loves to unpack and organize and clean everything lol i’ve been wanting a game like this for years and it’s hereee
Unpacking,Is it positive to play this game on a nintendo switch lite?
Unpacking,does it cost money?
Unpacking,Anybody who knows games similar to unpacking?
Unpacking,Great job Witchbeam (creators).
Unpacking,"One of my favorite games ever, the story was also amazing and emotional."
Unpacking,It's a Zen game until your OCD kicks in 😅
Unpacking,Wow looking at this game look like fun
Unpacking,"Mind candy:

IGN owns Humble Bundle. Humble Bundle publishes games under Humble Games, and Unpacking (the game reviewed in this video) is by Humble Games. No wonder it has such a high rating."
Unpacking,How do you save the game on the nintendo switch?
Unpacking,Do you have to use a laptop
Unpacking,"really wish this will be available on appstore :"""
Unpacking,This game actually surprised me. Really recommend this.
Unpacking,Does it spark joy?
Unpacking,Gonna be real depressing when we get to the care home dlc...
Unpacking,"Absolutely loved this game,kudos developers"
Unpacking,why no ps4/ps5 version?
Unpacking,Is this on Mobil
Unpacking,Even for little games you can't trust IGN journalists
Unpacking,Incredible game. Me and my 6 y.o. daughter can play it with a deep dive. Phenomenally satisfying
Unpacking,But $20 for this 🥶
Unpacking,Looks like this is a game for women and nosy people.
Unpacking,"Zen game = Virtual boring chores. Where you could have spent the time doing the actual real chores.

People will buy anything nowadays!"
Unpacking,Is it available for IOS ? pls answer
Unpacking,"I'm waiting for the Prequel to ""Unpacking"" titled ""Packing"". Can't wait."
Unpacking,"I've bought a new house an am moving soon.
Everything has been packed since early this year. This game will be a great prep for my unpacking"
Unpacking,"It's on Gamepass Day 1, because why not lol?"
Unpacking,Anyone know what to do or where to put the video with her ex? I’m stuck💀
Unpacking,"Ill be there soon im just cleaning my room
*loads up unpacking*"
Unpacking,"After just finishing this game, it gives me a reason to say that video games are art. ""Silence speaks volumes"""
Unpacking,I'll waiting for the unpacking of this game when the plysical version coming out 👀💦
Unpacking,it's relaxing but it's overpriced.. 20 euro on steam
Unpacking,8/10
Unpacking,Lately every game is being given a 8 by ign
Unpacking,Thinking of all the amazing AAA games that IGN scored worse than this lol
Unpacking,0:32 a moving story about moving hahahahaha 🤣
Unpacking,"*Literally just a game about unpacking boxes*
Nintendo: And that'll be $50"
Unpacking,"unpacking in real life
""How not to unpack"""
Unpacking,So proud to know this is an Australian developed game!
Unpacking,"So its an unpacking video, or a review?"
Unpacking,Bout to make a game call No Rent Money
Unpacking,"Xbox Game Pass day 1, I'll give It a try, thanks!"
Unpacking,Ign where is Riders Republic's review?
Unpacking,Can't wait for Paint Drying Simulator 😂
Unpacking,Looks boring
Unpacking,Here come all the COD players to piss all over a game this isn't a FPS
Unpacking,"Organizing your room 😠
Organizing your room, the game 😁"
Unpacking,Who keeps their toaster in a cabinet?
Unpacking,Price?
Unpacking,What sort of psychopath will play a clicking game on a console?
Unpacking,Unbox therapy approved this game
Unpacking,Looks like Habbo
Unpacking,IGN loves giving their own games 8/10
Unpacking,"I’m glad we still get games that are tranquil and peaceful, and something anyone can play"
Unpacking,Cool!
Unpacking,"It looks very calming, charming and unique. May have to give this a spin on game pass."
Unpacking,First maybe
Unpacking,"Hard to believe this was the same team behind Assault Android Cactus, one of the best and most fun Indie games that I've ever played, and now they're going the complete opposite direction with this game. I really have to give Witch Beam a lot of credit for their versatility."
Unpacking,"This game made me cry and i think its the only game that has ever done that, and it was super unexpected. I think it’s because ive been thinking about how when you’re young, you go through so many relationships that dont work. But one day, if you’re lucky, you wont have to search anymore and you will finally feel true security and stability with one person. This game acted out that exact thing and it really resonated with me and made me feel comforted in that regard"
Unpacking,These devs are from my city! Loved this game thanks for the reccomend action Jones!
Unpacking,This game is my daily life rn
Unpacking,Unique
Unpacking,i found this game incredibly depressing as the more challenging levels tend to not let you express yourself and so the progression of the game being more difficult seems to be in conflict with the core themes as well as the aesthetics of play the title seems to be going for.
Unpacking,This is such a Jones game I'd be shocked if it wasn't written and edited by him
Unpacking,"This is such a beautiful and wholesome idea, it's soothing just to think about playing it"
Unpacking,It's 1:45am here and I'm getting choked up here because of this review! This was beautifully written Jones! ♥️
Unpacking,L&R
Unpacking,1:57 I have this problem every week XD
Unpacking,This should be on a phone
Unpacking,looks right up my alley thanks yo
Unpacking,Beautiful little review for a beautiful little game.
Unpacking,Great review Jones. I bet it was cozy to play this and write/edit this review.
Unpacking,0:58 is that depeche mode 'Just cant get enough'????????
Unpacking,"Never heard of this game, will give it q look now. Thanks guys"
Unpacking,Coming soon on Game Pass.
Unpacking,Non-expositional storytelling is something the games industry needs to recognize and encourage more. Making every game be a movie is the dumbest path forward for the industry.
Unpacking,"hey a quick sudgestion, if the game is on gamepass would be nice if it is included in the video so people that dont know can just go and download it"
Unpacking,Touch controls on Windows?
Unpacking,"Between the Stanley Parable, Death Stranding, and this game, I now have an Office life simulator, Hiking Simulator, and Unpacking simulator lol"
Unpacking,1:42 DON'T LEMME LEAVE MURPH
Unpacking,Im getting COZY vibes from this game
Unpacking,"The little PS2 and GC games on the shelf are ao cute! One is even 'Platinum', the PAL 'Greatest Hits'.

This looks delightful, great review and thanks for bringing it to my attention!"
Unpacking,"This seems so simple and so beautiful, really glad you covered this game, I'm supporting these devs."
Unpacking,Why did this come out right when Animal Crossing new dlc comes out?
Unpacking,There’s a lot to unpack here.
Unpacking,Another great Aussie indie game!
Unpacking,Didn't know what this was ... But now I'm intrigued!
Unpacking,This sort of creativity is what will evolve video games from emulating movies into discovering the incredible ways gameplay can emotionally impact the player.
Unpacking,Its on gamepass on PC!
Unpacking,"Personal Possession Tetris

Alternate Title: A Place For Everything & Everything In Its Place (but that probably wouldn't fit on the box)"
Unpacking,Lol
Umurangi Generation,this makes me want to get a nice camera or just get my old hand-me-down polaroid camera and buy some film for it and test it out
Umurangi Generation,"I do like Pokemon Snap, but yeah the on rails stuff was eh. I liked the photography in Beyond Good and Evil. Sure it wasn't the major point of the game, but it was still pretty cool. I spent a good amount of time hunting down every single photo op."
Umurangi Generation,Try Sludge life if u liked Umurangi
Umurangi Generation,I wish the would make a newer jet set radio game or remaster it so I can play it for Xbox series x 😢
Umurangi Generation,I will always take a chance to plug Endless Ocean and it has a legitimately fun camera option.
Umurangi Generation,"actually insane how when this video came out, it was the first time in a good while I heard someone talk about photography in a way that was so simple but passionate and relatable- both IRL and within the game. really got me thinking again about environmental storytelling through photography and basically was the start of me falling in love with the medium all over again after feeling uninspired for so long. always grateful for this video - Umurangi Generation has been one of my fav games ever since this introduced me to it."
Umurangi Generation,Im honestly more used to selfies than 45mm yearbook photos
Umurangi Generation,this and some of the behind the scenes footage for the movie El Mariachi really opened my eyes with how lenses work and how different lenses can achieve different effects
Umurangi Generation,Update: Umurangi Generation Special Edition is available on Game Pass (PC/Console/Cloud).
Umurangi Generation,"I'm very happy that I watched this review 2 years ago when it released. I played Umurangi for the first time late last year, and I had a FANTASTIC time with it. I love photography and god DAMN was this game a blast to go through. Glad you reviewed this one, I wouldn't have known about it otherwise!"
Umurangi Generation,"""Cool shit"" editing basicly took away my mind for 3 hours straight and now it is 6 AM and I am going to cycle to bakery 🥴"
Umurangi Generation,"Kia Ora bro!

Glad you liked the game, I might add also that it was pretty cool how you could change the Game language to Maori (Native New Zealand) - it might’ve been a small choice for a lot of people but when I showed / told my Maori friends and family about this it made them smile and a lot of the older people even played a little on my Xbox to see it! 🙏🏽"
Umurangi Generation,Apparently a creator named Asire made the trailer for the Xbox version. The same creator of the ultra violent Hotline Miami mod named MAKE ME REAL.
Umurangi Generation,I've never noticed the CalorieMate in the background of NR's room before and as a MGS3 obsessive I am immediately envious.
Umurangi Generation,how do i change this god awful sensitivity i am dying
Umurangi Generation,We love seeing games created by tangata whenua.
Umurangi Generation,I dont know why but the controls on the pc version of this game sucked. Gave up on the first level.
Umurangi Generation,Good thing to see this game coming to Xbox gamepass in a day or so. I saw it and knew I remembered the game from this video.
Umurangi Generation,coz of this video it became one of my favorites I played last year!! love the art and music especially the most
Umurangi Generation,"My favorite part of the game is when you encounter a bit of graffiti saying, ""Never fear! The Centrist is here (unfortunately)!"" Brilliant."
Umurangi Generation,"I suppose being a professional photographer and cinematographer does have its drawbacks, as this video is 40% the game and 60% gushing about photography techniques. I'd rather be interested in the funny blond man talking about the viddy gam."
Umurangi Generation,I highly recommend going and checking out Thorhighheels YouTube channel.  He did the music for this game. He does really cool game review stuff.
Umurangi Generation,Brings me back to moving step by step in a circle in the middle of a public park for a 360 photo assignment in university. Or melting part of my bathtub trying to get a shot with fake blood and candles.
Umurangi Generation,Never knew about that mobile phone selfie vs normal camera thing. Very interesting!
Umurangi Generation,i was really waiting on a review on umurangi and hearing your pov with the game was real cool dude
Umurangi Generation,"Fun Fact: All four of the things James said he wished would be added to the game were in fact added later on in the Macro DLC expansion, alongside new maps and missions."
Umurangi Generation,"id love a version of this set in a beautiful, more nature-esque historical time period from the past, or hell even a version with multiple ""worlds"" you can shoot in, would be cool for a sequel"
Umurangi Generation,Oml. His phone camera turned him into an oblivion npc.
Umurangi Generation,"this was a really cool video, I loved hearing you talk about photography and how it works! it's clear that you're very passionate about it, and that's awesome :D"
Umurangi Generation,Lol what ??? Someone that doesn't care about pokemon snap I thought I was the only one 😂
Umurangi Generation,"I don’t know if I’ll be able to get this game, but this video was really something. I used to have a passing interest in photography and the thing about how phone cameras make you look worse really helped with my self esteem about how I look. Honestly I think I watched this at just the right time."
Umurangi Generation,Sometimes different cameras make you look like Mario 64 screen stretchy face
Umurangi Generation,"Hey man I bought this game yesterday on switch, really hope you could talk about the dlc called Macro, it's really just wow"
Umurangi Generation,Now on Switch!!
Umurangi Generation,Holy shit I can’t believe I’ve never noticed that about phone cameras! Also I’m definitely picking up this game now that it’s on switch >:D
Umurangi Generation,What’s the song at 2:16?
Umurangi Generation,just finished this wouldnt mind a sequal. I know there r 2 dlc lvls but man it was so fun
Umurangi Generation,This is now coming to Nintendo Switch in June 5th of this year!
Umurangi Generation,"7:56 - ""You also don't have any control over things like ISO, shutter speed, or F-stop""
Fun Fact: The DLC does actually add ISO adjustment and shutter speed to your options. So, now it's even _more_ in-depth."
Umurangi Generation,"I have yet to play this game, but it has me immediately more interested in photography than the actual photography class I took a couple years ago."
Umurangi Generation,This video made me some what interested in photography
Umurangi Generation,"Still super happy that you covered this game because I'm trying to become a photography teacher at the high school I work at and I would definitely have my students buy this game as part of our curriculum, especially since it gives them an easy way to learn how different focal points work, post processing and composition. 

On another note, I was like ""Why does his 20mm not a wide angle and look distorted?"" since I got a 20mm 1.8 in January for the purpose of having that wide angle look for portraits and wondered why 45mm was considered a ""close up"" lens for you, then I got a good look at your camera and saw that it's a Lumix GH micro four thirds. I'm currently using the Nikon Z6ii."
Umurangi Generation,"I've been looking into getting into photography; with the Switch version coming in (if it hasn't already), this is perfect timing! I don't have a PC just yet."
Umurangi Generation,What camera do you use?
Umurangi Generation,interesting to notice that both Nitro Rad's intro and Umurangi Generation's intro have a digital-ish whisper of the channel/game name
Umurangi Generation,"Absolutely beautiful! I wouldn't imagine taking some fancy yet simple shots like these, so it always blows my mind when I see a simple lens change drastically changes the picture"
Umurangi Generation,"Bought it the other day and I'm obsessed with it. It's everything I wanted out of a photo mode stretched out as the primary mechanic. And when are you gonna talk about the Macro expansion, which addresses some of the complaints you made?"
Umurangi Generation,I'm a photographer. I'm a gamer. I love ThorHighHeels. I need this game.
Umurangi Generation,this future is so shitty people look like rec room humans
Umurangi Generation,Very late but I would honestly love a full lecture about cinematography and regular photography from you James!
Umurangi Generation,Phone Nitrorad honestly looks like a ps1 platformer mascot
Umurangi Generation,"i dont usually play many games anymore, mostly from a combination of shifting interests and consistently thin income, but !! after watching nitro rads best of 2020 video and seeing this game, than discovering they made an entire video for it! i fell in love. i played the game from start to finish today  and i think if you are remotely into design or photography, maybe art in general, *or* you have a thing for anti authoritarian and punk aesthetics!!! get it if u have the attetnion  time and money and desire
its realllly goood"
Umurangi Generation,"BG&E is an all time favorite, in no small part because of the photography collection aspect."
Umurangi Generation,firewatch gave you an old disposable film camera with a limited number of shots that you were free to use at any point in the game
Umurangi Generation,Nothing says 'Fight the power' quite like a Hitler reference as the game's composer.. the irony DOES escape me
Umurangi Generation,Does anyone know when this game is coming to the switch? I’ve looked it up on the Nintendo eshop and can’t find it
Umurangi Generation,"So with this video I learned why the photoes of my drawings taken with my cellphone are a little off every time, thanks Nitro"
Umurangi Generation,"I love Pokemon Snap as a puzzle game, but as someone that does photography/videography I shake my head at the scoring system in it. Oak always be wanting your subject center frame and filling as much of the frame as possible. Ew."
Umurangi Generation,"Oh this is a good jumping point for subscribing , good stuff Nitro."
Umurangi Generation,ayy gonna review the dlc? :eyes:
Umurangi Generation,"I hope this game gets a follow up so much, it looks so awesome. Games like this and Jet Set Radio are very relevant these days."
Umurangi Generation,"Dude I think they listened to you, one of the items in the DLC allows you to get REALLY low for shots"
Umurangi Generation,"on top of everything said in this video, there is DLC that was released a few days ago."
Umurangi Generation,I guess in the shitty future it is forbidden to stand horizontally.
Umurangi Generation,Is it bad that I keep coming back to this video for Photography advice?
Umurangi Generation,"You're definitely one of the best youtubers ever. You not only have a great personality and charisma, but you create such amazing content that I'm baffled you haven't reached a critical mass of subscribers!!!
Every single video of yours I watch just has this feeling to it that I just can't quite point out, but I adore it.
I just have one thing left to say; keep going, man. 'Cause I'm gonna be here watching until you get tired of it or something."
Umurangi Generation,"There's a DLC for Umurangi Generation coming up, might be interesting to cover as well... Just an idea, though."
Umurangi Generation,"DOPE review, love how you teach us about lenses while covering the game. 5 stars boyo"
Umurangi Generation,"That image in the news sheet looks suspiciously like Eva unit 01.  Also, ""wall project""?  Is this kaiju coming from the sea like in Pacific Rim?"
Umurangi Generation,I've always had an interest in doing photography as a hobby
Umurangi Generation,"As someone who does cosplay photography as a hobby, this be fun to play with all the cool atmosphere"
Umurangi Generation,"Nitrorad, do you film with the same camera you take pictures with?"
Umurangi Generation,that phone camera tho
Umurangi Generation,This looks like something I would love
Umurangi Generation,Needs a remake Nitro
Umurangi Generation,"6:38 

LEVEL UP+

confidence increased by 10%"
Umurangi Generation,This is my favorite NitroRad video. I really love how you feel that the topic is soooooo important to him.
Umurangi Generation,"Man I missed your sweetness
Im glad for what you spoke at the end and I am glad for what you expressed
I cant wait to try it out
Darnit I wish to buy it with my own money and much!
Thank you so so so much NItro
you are like a friend for me for how generously fantastic I feel with your amazing contest"
Umurangi Generation,"Yo i saw that name and was just thinking ""oHhh that's definitely a Maori word""
You have no idea how excited I got when the Steam description said Aotearoa. I love it when I see things from my country."
Umurangi Generation,"I just did some googling to see if this one's on switch yet (later this year!) But DLC areas were also announced and with it will come a crouch feature, so you were heard, dude!"
Umurangi Generation,Dead Rising?
Umurangi Generation,"Aaand onto my wishlist it goes. What a seriously cool concept for a game.
Loved the mini photography lesson, btw. You actually did a much better job explaining lenses than my photography professor did----for some reason he never used visual examples to explain visual differences when it came to the basics."
Umurangi Generation,"Nice video! I really enjoyed game as someone who is an aspiring photographer/filmmaker but had a hard time trying to achieve the objectives without looking it up but I guess it has to do with not looking outside of the box and it's also annoying to unlock new lenses at each level when it could have been beneficial in the previous one but again, thinking outside the box is something to understand when doing photography or working in any art form.

Still, a game that might be on my GOTY list since we don't get many photography games these days. Also the music by ThorHighHeels is a plus!"
Umurangi Generation,"Thank you for making this video nitrous oxide radical, it's quickly become one of my favorite indie games"
Umurangi Generation,I just saw a steam ad for  Pupperazzie. A indie game about dog photography.
Umurangi Generation,This looks cool and unique.
Umurangi Generation,3:14 that sync was glorious
Umurangi Generation,"I looked Umarangi up after seeing Adolf Nomura's not-name attached to it on Spotify. 

Glad to see Punishment in Higher Places made the cut. That song is the shit."

Umurangi Generation,Beyond Good and Evil is such an underrated game. Does anyone have infos on the sequel by any chance? Are they still making it?
Umurangi Generation,Opinion on dead rising's photography system?
Umurangi Generation,"the music is made by local youtube legend ThorHighHeels. check him out, he does GOOD shit"
Umurangi Generation,Loved to learn about photography and watch a nitro rad review at the same time.
Umurangi Generation,"Technically this game is an fps game. Completely by definition, it is a first person shooter.

That’s really funny to me"
Umurangi Generation,"Do a suda51 game nitro, please.."
Umurangi Generation,"Pikmin 3's KopPad Camera function is fantastic!! You can just look around and take pictures of the weird creatures around and the postapocalyptic earth, u areon rails but you can make your own rails throughout each map! woth the Go Here function! it definitely scratched the nature photography itch i had"

Umurangi Generation,here for it.
Umurangi Generation,"""Umurangi Generation is loud, raw, angry. An anti-colonial protest wrapped in Jet Set Radio and Evangelion, handing you a wonderfully tactile camera with which to capture the end of the world.""

Nice, lets see if it can be released in China, after all, they need this kind of game more then the europeans. Who now have all embraced multiculturalism and are fighting their own colonial past."
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Turn-based = Boring 😴
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,And to believe the franchise all started with a DSi game…wow
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,It's more like Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories in terms of combat.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,SteamWorld Dig and Heist are much better then this hope they make  an Dig 3 Or Heist2.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"Are there any other games like this? Adventure type, with the card gameplay"
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Why does the guy talking sound like Spencer from Criminal minds
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,This game is art!!
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Just make me want a Ogre Battle remake and remaster with modern design
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,I need to decide between this and Gordian Quest.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,I'm a sucker for card based games. I picked this one up on sale on the eShop. I think it was 12 bucks.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,So its a Baten Kaitos clone.  And that aint a bad thing.  Will be getting this!
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"Its like old jrpg from gamecube in terms of battle, I guese..."
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"Okay honestly,
If you think about how nice looking and polished steamworld dig, dig 2 and heist was,
This one just doesn't fit the steamworld style and vibe
I got bored after an hour unlike the other SW games, where i played them about 3 times and it usually never got old."
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Recolors are in literally every popular RPG series what's wrong with them here?
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,absolutely love their robot art.. but im a bit bias <3
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Amazing game
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,i'd be into this if it was just a regular turn based rpg. can't get into card mechanics unfortunately
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Ricky Berwick brought me here
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Im here cause i already finish the game . defeating behemoth sure tough as hell .. but im enjoying it !!!
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Fun game my first card game been craving for more...
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"Are there any super bosses in this game. I ask because I'm more of a jrpg player (like Final Fantasy, Tales of games) and I like grinding to get my characters stronger. (or in this case better cards I'm guessing)"
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Does anyone know more games like this? a party based RPG sort of type
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"LMAO IGN calls this 5min video a review, while Giantbomb has a ""Quick look"" video that is 30mins long.  IGN is fukn useless these days."
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"This is probably the most informative review I've watched so far, ironically. I think I may wait for the game to go on sale to 10-15 before I commit."
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"Switch only...but my SteamWorld collection is on Vita and PS4.. 😣 (I also have my Switch, but....)"
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,I love the gameplay and the characters since I got to knew Steamworld heist through steam powered giraffes music for Steamworld heist
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,So it’s Baten Kaitos. That’s exactly what I was hoping for.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,LOVE THE SLAY THE SPIRE STYLE
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,9.5/10 for me
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,I may just drop hearthstones for this game bruhs.(far as a game that addictively fun and not too complex)
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,I’ll buy for $10 and play on Xbox
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Like materia i see
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,I may consider this
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Talks about cards for entire review not story or quests.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"Not the best review, i know how the combat works now but that's about it."
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"As I love FGO, I'm definitely gonna try this out... once I get a Switch."
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Waiting for the pc version.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"Combat style is an iteration on Slay the Spire, doesn’t even mention it until the end of the video. 🙄"
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,I'm so glad to see how this franchise has grown.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Jesus I hate this combat.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,But does it make you *FEEL* like batman?
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,need this for PC
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Is this the nerdy guy from Criminal Minds?
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Their Reddit AMA said they had plans for a physical release later this year! Thinking of getting it then
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Great review Tom - I've been excited about this one for a while. Can't wait to pick it up and give it a try.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Meh....I got many other games to play before this one for sure...
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,At first I thought that I couldn’t enjoy a card game like this then I remembered that I lovedddddd mega man battle network
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"I’m still not sold on it, yet, so I’ll wait for more reviews, especially what this week’s NVC panel has to say. 

I’d like something a little fuller than a 15-20hr Campaign, and Tom already saying that the enemy variety is a lil thin is not terribly encouraging, either. I want to want this, but there doesn’t seem to be enough going on for me to bite."
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,It doesn't feel like card game even though it relies heavily on cards 🙄
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,I really liked Dig. This looks unappealing.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Kermit the frog reviewed this.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,although I'll buy this I had preferred steamworld heist 2
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,A steamworld game not on steam is not ok.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,The SteamWorld games are always fantastic.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Looks boring af mobile lookingass
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,So what similarities are there with Slay the Spire?
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"I know I don't speak for everyone but I wish they would have just put their time and effort into steamworld dig 3 or something more open world third person like, baby something akin to Darksiders. Imagine living in a third-person open world with the steamworld genre. Sounds very cool."
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Gave it a 6.2/10 you're welcome
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"Decks do not matter nor a focus...2 min later, decks matter and are a focus."
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,The music sounds amazing.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Imagine&Form is the best indie studio!
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"Ah, Image & Form. These guys always create such amazing games!"
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Seems like a simplify kingdom hearts chains of memories.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Great review. This is a must have for me.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"Oh, that's not smoke, that's just steam, steam from the SteamWorld we'll be having, Mmmmmm, SteamWorld!"
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,is this game coming too steam too?
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,I'm liking the music at least
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Slay the Spire?
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"If your into fortnite check out Tactical Sypher 
Help him grow drop a like or a sub!!! 
If ur felling generous ofcourse :)





Have A Amazing Day!!"
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,ps4 or only on craPC?
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Avenger end game three days Hype alert hype alert
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,First
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,8.6 thank me later
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"Sorry this one is a little late, the games come thick and fast sometimes! What do you make of this one? Which is your favourite of the SteamWorld games so far? What genre would you like to see them try next? Happy gaming. Glen"
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"Hi Glen hope all is well, just picked this up in a sale £8 glad I did, it’s a great game"
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Pov; it's for sale in the switch store and you're checking reviews to see if you should bite on it 😂
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,This has been one of my favorite card RPG games ever.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"Great review. Thorough, straight forward, video matches what you are describing. Just wonderful."
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"Wait, _whaaaaaaaat?_ There's a Steamworld game I haven't played? And it's tower defense? I had no idea they had released a title for the DSI. I can't believe I find this out by randomly watching a review for a game I've owned since launch."
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,I’ve been looking for a new switch RPG with both this and CrossCode which would you pick? I watched both reviews just asking personal preference. I do enjoy Slay the spire so was wondering if this is the better choice
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,I wish they would make Steamworld Heist 2.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,+1 for noticing the binary code! They are called the punch cards for a good reason ;)
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"Great review, consider me a new subscriber!"
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,It’s like Wizard 101 but with Steambots
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,You guys are easily my favorite reviewers of switch games! Keep up the great world!
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,I got this and Ori & The Blind Forest with an eshop card I got for Christmas. I 100%'d Ori in one evening and started this game last night. I'm glad I picked it up as I'm really enjoying it so far. Just came back to watch your review again for old times sake.  😁
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,I like steampunk but will I like this? Meh I’d probably just go for final fantasy instead
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"Love all their steam world games, especially the steam dig series. Hope they'll continue making more on that series, it'd be cool if they make some castlevania style game but with steam world context."
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"The game looks great visually. The characters move around the screen very similar to Dust: An Elysian Tail. Even the design reminds me of it too, that sort of 3d 2d cartoonish look, just a different approach on coloring/shading. ----- As far as the frustration goes with card drawing, a physical card game generally doesn't have rules where you get to narrow your draw to a certain type of card or pile. Now cards for other characters being omitted makes sense, but sometimes, it's just luck of the draw and the frustration is real."
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"I was not sold on the card mechanic but seeing it in action I think I get it now, looks fun but that random lack of useful cards would bug me, so glad it's not too often
Have played Dig on ps4 haven't picked up heist yet (looks awesome) 
The team really have done a real job with the steam world games linking up, love a turn based game. What else could be next? Steam world kart? Beat em up? Bring them on if they are this high quality I say!"
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"To minimize overloading your hand with SP cards you should use your redraws to swap them out before playing your last card on the turn. I think I only ever ended up with a dead hand maybe 3 or 4 times throughout my entire 30 hour playthru on Legend difficulty. Also, don't be afraid to use healing items in battle if you're having trouble. You may want to lame a fight out to heal up your party before progressing though.

Deck balance is also important. Keep your character deck balanced around a 4/4 split of action and SP cards with the SP cards having manageable costs (they can't all cost 3 or 4 SP). You may want 1 member of your party to act as a battery character that generates SP. Galleo and the 4th character can do this.

This game was great and especially lovable if you like building characters and parties."
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Not my cup of tea but thanks for the in depth review yet again!
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Man the style of these reviews is awesome. Truly made with love!
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,What a quaint little game! The world and characters are both enchanting and whimsical. The card battle system looks much better than some other card based games I've played which killed the appeal for me *cough cough* chain of memories -_-;; I agree with your review scores and I appreciate the heads up on the random draw mechanics. For a $22 game I think it's worth the buying and giving a try.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"I'm on the fence about this one. Have avoided the game genre before as I never really enjoyed it, but I love the style of this one. Thanks for the review lads! Gives a nice in-depth insight."
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Y'all do giveaways?
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,This game would have been so fucking sick as a beatem up brawler. The graphics are so gorgeous.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"I’ve been having a ton of fun with this one. I know you brought it up as a negative, but I really like the mechanic of still drawing cards for your dead party members. It makes losing a character feel like even more of a hit as it then slows you down. It reminds me of the system in Mage Knight the Board Game where you take damage in the form of blank cards in your deck. As you take hits, you have less optimal turns. For me I find it adds to the tension."
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Thanks for review this not my type of game but seems fun
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Steam world games my love games this game will be remembered for year  like the other i love it so much great review Thank you switch up keep it up !! 😗
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Image & Form confirmed a physical release later this year.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,This is by far my favorite review by you guys! I love seeing you guys grow and getting better and better at your jobs. Love it!
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"So far you are the only review to mention being able to regain your health via statues but enemies respawn, almost similar to something in a Souls game. That’s why you guys are awesome, you pick up on a lot of the smaller things in games that other people ignore, but is extremely helpful in determine whether to buy a game or not. You cover SO MUCH not in other reviews. Excellent review!"
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"Thanks for the review guys. Great job, will be picking this one up."
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"Game looks good, but $25, no thanks."
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,amazing Game
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Map movements remind me of the legend of mystical ninja game for the SNES... love that game.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,I adore Image&Form's games and as fun as this one looks I still think I'm going to wait for a sale price because I'm not sure if the card mechanic is something I'd enjoy or not.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Nice one Glen! Never played a Steamworld game but maybe here’s the place to start! I really admire how they try their hand at different genres
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Game looks great but I am holding on til slay the spire comes out on switch for my deck building fill. Also any chance you guys got news on the Yugioh game for the west? I miss playing yugioh but dont wanna jump through hoops getting the japanese version.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Looks like a fantastic game!
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Visual looks good and gameplay doesn't complicated like others that gets boring when there's too much instructions.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"reminds me a lot of metal gear acid for the psp, it used to had a turn based action gamplay style where move where dealt in cards, one of my favorite games, might give this one a try"
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,I maybe new to Steamworld series but I love how this game's graphic give you that feeling like you're in a painting like how I felt when I played Legend of Mana when I was much younger with my brother.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"yaaay my SwitchUp fix, need it baaaaad! Thanks fellers"
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Wahoo! I’m excited for this. I think I’m gonna wait for the physical release tho.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"I've never played a Steamworld game. However, I loved Slay the Spire so this seems like the perfect one for me to get into! Thanks for an excellent and in-depth review I'll have to look into this one!"
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"looks lovely, I really dig the art style. thanks for the review and especially for explaining the card combat mechanics."
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Please stop yelling at me at the end of all your titles.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"British accent 18/20
Video length 15/20
Amount of different scores in the review 20/20
Steamy gameplay 19/20"
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Thanks for the review and I didn't even realize all of their games were different
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Absolutely loved this one. Gonna revisit it soon and start fresh. Great job as always
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"I don’t know how I feel about this game jus yet🤔, but nice review Glen 😁😁"
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Interesting game review. Anything similar to Battle Chasers: Nightwar?
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"fantastic review, so in depth. Image and form have become a trusted brand for me. solid games and im a massive fan of their style of steampunk. in fact when i talk to anyone about steampunk , these steamworld games are what image is formed in my mind first. love em. No cards to purchase outside of the game also makes this worthy of a purchase."
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Thank you SwitchUp for yet another great review.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Thanks for reviewing this one
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Went to the new discord and back to youtube and bam 1st view. Something to watch whilst ignoring the kids...
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Image and form are amazing game developers
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,Looks great!!
Thimbleweed Park,my love game
Thimbleweed Park,If the ending wasn't so awful it would have been perfect. Could have left things open for sequels!
Thimbleweed Park,Deathspank is better
Thimbleweed Park,"""Thimbleweed park is not a comedy""
Um wut?"
Thimbleweed Park,Great review!
Thimbleweed Park,The clown is soooo hilarious! couldn't stop laughing. Game is very similar to the Day of the Tentacle series. if not made by the same developers.
Thimbleweed Park,Just completed it 7/10 it's no monkey's island not bad just not great
Thimbleweed Park,"I have issue with the fact that some characters change their options after something happens that is really unrelated to them. So, you think you're at a dead end with that character. A bit of sloppy writing IMHO."
Thimbleweed Park,Broken Sword 1 & 2 should be the first games mentioned when talking about point & click adventures. no diss to monkey island but the story line is just much better and the puzzles are a lot more logical.
Thimbleweed Park,how do the graphics differ between ps4 or switch? which should i buy?
Thimbleweed Park,Here cause its free on epic games
Thimbleweed Park,Lol 20$ Iits up to over 250 for physical bundle and 100$ for just the cartridge. I’m bidding on 1 now on eBay. It’s up to 38$ I have 15 minutes left. My top bid is $50. If I lose I lose. I’ll get it digital.
Thimbleweed Park,Picelart is gorgeous. But thimbleweed park wasn't that great of a game. It was irritating to play and switching between characters. It didn't have the same appeal as maniac mansion had.
Thimbleweed Park,I think I made a big mistake to play this in casual mode. I was afraid of the puzzles since it's my first PnC but I ended up loosing alot of content
Thimbleweed Park,Now imagine this as a Netflix show...
Thimbleweed Park,Brilliant game
Thimbleweed Park,The timespan From 1987 maniac mansion to 2017 thimbleweed park.. this is likely to be last game we get from Ron Gilbert.
Thimbleweed Park,Starring: FBI Most Unwanteds.
Thimbleweed Park,I got it for free and i still feel ripped off...
Thimbleweed Park,Here because it’s free on epic games store right now.
Thimbleweed Park,Definitely did not end up here because of a epic games notification
Thimbleweed Park,It’s for free right now
Thimbleweed Park,"Grab it, its FREE NOW.!!! (Epic store)"
Thimbleweed Park,its free now
Thimbleweed Park,Glad to see Epic Store brought you here.
Thimbleweed Park,I was literally just playing this 1 hour ago because its free on the epic store.
Thimbleweed Park,ШОЗАХуита
Thimbleweed Park,Lol just got this free
Thimbleweed Park,What's the score you dummy?
Thimbleweed Park,"its free in epic store now

Thimbleweed Park,Its now free BTW

Thimbleweed Park,The game is now for free on epic games
Thimbleweed Park,its free on the epic games store :)
Thimbleweed Park,IT IS FREE ON EPIC GAME
Thimbleweed Park,"2019 and its free On EPIC store

Thimbleweed Park,If you guys are ever looking for games similar to Thimbleweed park here's a list of 10 similar ones https://www.gamersdecide.com/articles/games-like-thimbleweed-park
Thimbleweed Park,"Just finished the game.  I really loved the story but near the end with the ending, it kind of hurt the experience for me.  Had such a great buildup and mystery only for the payoff to not be worth it in the end.  I know one of the Monkey Island games ended similarly, but it's 2019..retro fun shouldn't also mean retro poor endings."

Thimbleweed Park,In due time this game will be as celebrated as MM.
Thimbleweed Park,I wish Telltale’s Back to the Future game could’ve been as good as this.
Thimbleweed Park,really enjoyed this game!! amazing!
Thimbleweed Park,"I found the tokens to play in the arcade!! If anyone wants to know, just ask. I don't want to spoil it for other players. 
*Hint:* It involves someone's smelly head."
Thimbleweed Park,Good buy for Switch ?
Thimbleweed Park,"Just in case anyone was wondering this game is very funny,how the reviewer can suggest it's not is a mystery."
Thimbleweed Park,Definitely getting it for the switch
Thimbleweed Park,And how could you forget to mention Maniacs Mansion?
Thimbleweed Park,I'm here because they're making a Switch version.
Thimbleweed Park,"Can I chime in? first of I loved the game up to a certain point but it's not really a pixel perfect homage to ye olden days. Some graphical choices really bugged me when I was playing. Like character scalling when they were in the distance (they weren't just a mess of 4 pixels but a perfect render of the bigger model). Or some animations (like any lever that you pulled or pushed) that looked way to smooth. Even if you ignore the widescreen you can still clearly see they took some shortcuts when designing the ""retro"" feel of the game. Instead of pixels shifting from point to point they glide smoothly. That kid of ruins the nostalgia factor doesn't it? Also... The ending is just a cop out. I got REALLY invested in the story and wanted to find out more and then it's just nothing more than a ""St. Elswhere"" style cop out with no real conclussion."
Thimbleweed Park,currently playing this game. I loved it. Wandering aimlessly for hours just to find out clues and solve puzzles.
Thimbleweed Park,i didn't even know this game had come out no one's talking about it
Thimbleweed Park,I beat Thimbleweed Park on Casual Mode in about 11 hours. I'm excited to go back and play again in Hard Mode to see what I missed!
Thimbleweed Park,How do you put a digital release on a shelf?
Thimbleweed Park,looks great
Thimbleweed Park,A 2.45 minute review. Wow. Way to go IGN.
Thimbleweed Park,It's like a Telltale game only actually good
Thimbleweed Park,"Ah, now THIS is what I wanted from Tim Shafer's bloated celebrity-fest."
Thimbleweed Park,
Thimbleweed Park,Box contains 640x480 talkie CD-ROM version and a 320x200 floppy version both for 386s. I wish.
Thimbleweed Park,"Fantastic review, Ryan. Thank you so much :)"
Thimbleweed Park,"So between this, Blaster Master Zero, Zelda and DaS3 DLC - 2017 has done in 3 months what 2016 failed to do in 12 D:"
Thimbleweed Park,yet you have never reviewed The Book of Unwritten Tale 2
Thimbleweed Park,i pick this and snake pass up for X1  man this yr is a killer for awesome games ...next up persona 5
Thimbleweed Park,can't wait for the ps4 release!
Thimbleweed Park,looks sooo good! pretty!
Thimbleweed Park,"Loved Maniac Mansion, it was my favourite game for awhile growing up, but could never finish the game.  I've heard some point and click games have a type of bug where if you do something in the wrong order, you can't finish the game, but the game doesn't tell you that.  Does anyone know if Thimbleweed Park has that type of ""glitch""?"
Thimbleweed Park,Looks cool. Great review
Thimbleweed Park,I'm a huge fan of all the classic Lucas Arts adventure games so this is right up my alley. I hope it gets a Switch release in the future.
Thimbleweed Park,5.8/10 you're welcome
Thimbleweed Park,Switch version?
Thimbleweed Park,"This game has .8 points more than Mass Effect: Andromeda...




Let that sink in people, *LET THAT SINK IN!*"
Thimbleweed Park,Will this be out on PS4? Massive fan of the Monkey Island games
Thimbleweed Park,Mulder and Scully are in this? I'm sold.
Thimbleweed Park,Amazing!
Thimbleweed Park,Well it's good to see that the point and click can still thrive to this day.
Thimbleweed Park,man this shit looks hard.. Why i cant play it... I hate getting stuck and not knowing what to do.
Thimbleweed Park,Where do you buy this?
Thimbleweed Park,Cool. I'm getting it today.
Thimbleweed Park,Better then Andromeda.
Thimbleweed Park,The pixel art is gorgeous.
Thimbleweed Park,Ah man this looks awesome
Thimbleweed Park,Adventure games are back <3
Thimbleweed Park,My first buy of 2017 in other words. Luckily this isn't dumbed down for the mainstream audience like Andromeda.
Thimbleweed Park,"Better than Zelda BotW or Persona 5.

*Runs*"
Thimbleweed Park,"HI PEOPLE OF YOUTUBE. I AM A SMALL YOUTUBER WHO IS TRYING TO REACH MY GOAL OF 800 SUBS BY TONIGHT! PLEASE MAKE IT HAPPEN. ALSO I STREAM GTA, NBA2K17 AND MORE EVERNIGHT... SORRY TO PROMOTE I JUST. NEED RECOGNITION"
Thimbleweed Park,It's not a comedy? Dammit. I love comedy point and click games.
Thimbleweed Park,snore fest.
Thimbleweed Park,8.5 bye
Thimbleweed Park,boo
Thimbleweed Park,It got a 8.5 if anyone cared
Thimbleweed Park,Stop.
Thimbleweed Park,You grognarg
Thimbleweed Park,The Star Trek original series point and click games are probably my favourite point and click style games.
Thimbleweed Park,"I'm about 5 hours into this game, reading everything and exploring at my pace, and i'm having a blast. I'm 12 years old again!"
Thimbleweed Park,Its free
Thimbleweed Park,"got it for free, so I'm good."
Thimbleweed Park,"Note: This game is free on the epic games store, you get to keep it forever but only for a limited time so hurry!"
Thimbleweed Park,"Free right now, Limited time tho"
Thimbleweed Park,Free on epic games
Thimbleweed Park,"They should remake ""ShadowGate"" from back in NES days. They did ShadowGate 64, but it was trash."
Thimbleweed Park,or you get the game from the epic games store in less than 2 weeks
Thimbleweed Park,im about to spend 63 buks on this game
Thimbleweed Park,One of the best games I've ever played and probably THE best soundtrack
Thimbleweed Park,Fun game but a rather disappointing ending
Thimbleweed Park,Honestly the ending is what I didn't like about this game. I was disappointed. It was building up so much...
Thimbleweed Park,Why am i collecting all this dust? Why?!
Thimbleweed Park,I just get so bored of these games. Thanks though.
Thimbleweed Park,"Are you a fan of the Broken Sword series or Silence? This does look pretty good, as I am a fan of Point and Click adventure games."
Thimbleweed Park,"Karan man I love you.
Your reviews are amazing.
Just got this on Switch."
Thimbleweed Park,Am going to buy it not sure if I should
Thimbleweed Park,Well to me agent Ray is the less interesting one of the two. That and she's a bitch.
Thimbleweed Park,"its a great game ive  recently completed it,but is there a second game?(like chrono triggers game+).my autosave has continued counting(i completed it in 18hrs and it continues,18+in the new game i started)
ransom the clown is taking the piss out of restrictions placed on maniac mansion,they had to change the script from shit head to tuna head.

its a buy i agree,its great to see something other than a first person shooter on the shelves."
Thimbleweed Park,Should come to PS and Xbox.... then will play.
Thimbleweed Park,"Is this the kind of game that a guy who really liked Dropsy, The Witness, Myst, and Obduction could get into? The HUD looks so cluttered..."
Thimbleweed Park,Glad to see point and click adventure games making a resurgence. One of my favorite genres from back in the day
Thimbleweed Park,"Is the easier mode in this game like the easy mode in Monkey Island 2, where it cuts out HUGE chunks of the regular mode and just hands you most of the solutions? Or does the easy mode still feel like a complete experience?
I'm asking cuz I might play the easy mode first and the hard mode after that if the easy mode is still a complete experience."
Thimbleweed Park,"Thank you Karak, for steering me to this game. Absolutely love it. Excellent review."
Thimbleweed Park,great video
Thimbleweed Park,Krusty the clown was Jewish so probably didn't celebrate Chistmas... sorry I couldn't help myself.  Great review :)
Thimbleweed Park,Will you be reviewing Dawn of War 3 when it comes out?
Thimbleweed Park,Love this game.  Delores and Ransome are definitely my favourite characters.
Thimbleweed Park,"Thanks for the review, I really enjoy the diversity of games you cover!"
Thimbleweed Park,"I had no idea this existed. Back in the day, Monkey Island 1 +2 were the shit. But I don't think I have enough patience for a P'n'C these days."
Thimbleweed Park,"sry man, crap game is crap, even through nostalgia lenses ..."
Thimbleweed Park,I'll be picking this one up for sure. Thanks for the great review as always!
Thimbleweed Park,"ok
TBH, these games dont interst me and look quite boring. My loss maybe.

But these reviews are always so well done. So I will watch just to hear the amazing analogies and witty fukn dialogue.

Thanks ACG. The only gaming channel worth watching."
Thimbleweed Park,"Gosh, I remember when you had 150 subs.  Great to see you've grown."
Thimbleweed Park,"Looks very Maniac Mansion.  Very interesting.  I hope the P&C adventure genre starts to make a comeback.  I don't mean the licensed schlock Telltale shits out, (except Wolf Among Us and Walking Dead Season 1, those were great), I mean honest to God adventure games."
Thimbleweed Park,"loving the game so far, if you grew up with Maniac Mansion and classic LucasArts games, you're gonna love it. It's like a mix of Maniac Mansion, X-Files and Twin Peaks, all mixed through the blender that is Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick's particular brand of humor"
Thimbleweed Park,Best reviewer right now!
Thimbleweed Park,"It's out on Xbox One, too!"
Thimbleweed Park,"8:17 ZAK MCCRACKEN REPRESENT!

:D"
Thimbleweed Park,"I grew up in that era of Atari 2600 and IBM 286's. I dont really get those feelings of nostalgia when I see pixel graphics, more of a feeling of ""been there, done that.""  Nowadays, I prefer more modern graphical styles.  As far as the other aspects of the game, it looks fun."
Thimbleweed Park,"Great job ONCE AGAIN.


Man oh MAN i want to see your thoughts/review/breakdown and a walking the walk with breath of the wild."
Thimbleweed Park,"I hope I don't start a dumpster fire with the pc elitists, but I think this is the kind of game that will do really well on a MacBook. "
Thimbleweed Park,"As someone who's name really is Ransom, I really hope this character doesn't suck. I've always been afraid of someone named Ransom/Ransome doing some horrible shit and ruining everything for the few of us who are out there. As a side note, you replaced his name with ""random"" at one point during the video, but don't be ashamed. That shit happens to me every goddamn day, along with questions about whether I was kidnapped as a baby."
Thimbleweed Park,Seems like this game does everything that Tim Schafer's Broken Promises/Double Fucked Adventure was supposed to do but didn't.
Thimbleweed Park,"ACG & The Jimquisition are the only reviews I trust. Keep up the excellent work, Karak."
Thimbleweed Park,"I wear size 11, it's not clown big :D"
Thimbleweed Park,acg are you going to do a review on The Show 17?
Thimbleweed Park,Great stuff man. Omg you crack me up lol
Thimbleweed Park,this is a cartoon
Thimbleweed Park,"Your commentary is filled with nostalgic bits from so many times in my life

even managed to throw in a team America reference lol.

awesome man. I watch your reviews even if I don't have the console, or have no initial interest in the game."
Thimbleweed Park,I'm watching reviews of games I've never heard of lol
Thimbleweed Park,A dear friend of mine voiced one of the characters in this game :)
Thimbleweed Park,Available on GoG too
Thimbleweed Park,Have you reviewed Day of Infamy Keric?
Thimbleweed Park,"Just picked this one up....thanks for the awesome review, and like always you're time is greatly appreciated. You're doing a public service for all of us."
Thimbleweed Park,Clownshoessizeeleven one word man ONE WORD!
Thimbleweed Park,Willy Beamish on Sega CD is a fun game if you dig point and click
Thimbleweed Park,"best reviewer in the game, almost wish you gave a score just cause as you know a review is only deemed important if giving a number. As shit as Metacritic is you should be on that list of important reviewers"
Thimbleweed Park,Twin Peaks.....
Thimbleweed Park,"The use of the color palette on this game is stellar. Many titles usually forget about the use of dull tones to emulate darkness, and I can see the effect masterfully done here. Also, the names on the phone directory are in fact all the backers of the game."
Thimbleweed Park,AGC is the most honest and best reviewer on youtube. So much better than the IGN crap!
Thimbleweed Park,"Well this game seems HUGE.. Probably too much to chew for me :( 

Nice review as always. You nailed the conclusion. :)"
Thimbleweed Park,Glad to see there is interest in games like these still. Reminds me of some classics I still enjoy to this day. Hopefully it will come to consoles fairly soon.
Thimbleweed Park,you can almost hear the voice actor thinking about what they're going to make for saying this next line lmfao definitely the most quotable game reviewer
Thimbleweed Park,"It seems to really heavily lean on Twin Peaks, while I love that series I hope it doesn't feel like a variation of a theme"
Thimbleweed Park,"nice review karak :) never got into this genre though, so i will stick to have a nostalgic feeling just be watching the graphics hehe"
Thimbleweed Park,4:55 That Naked Lunch reference.
Thimbleweed Park,Ha ha ha ha! I see you found the water fountain too! I lost 10 minutes to that thing... I really appreciate the review and the quality as always. Thanks.
Thimbleweed Park,Meh games that can be run on a browser are not worth paying for in my opinion.
Thimbleweed Park,That Sam-and-Max-style TV with a cat scratching a dudes eye out at 2:44 out is definitely going to be the main selling point to me
Thimbleweed Park,"This is definitely game of the year (1993), for me. Especially the sweet ""talkie"" CD-version for my new 2x speed CD-ROM drive with Sound Blaster Pro! Lucas Arts has done it again... Oh, wait... lol. Joking aside, this game is very good, so full of nostalgia juice on one hand (for old timers like me), but holds its own as a great point and click adventure game with great story, characters and dialogues on par with the classics. I am 5 hours in right now and I only wish they made music with the legendary Roland MT-32 (at least as an option), because right now the studio-recorded music is the only thing that kinda a bit breaks the impression of a real Lucas Arts old-school gem. I would love Ron Gilbert to continue to make games like this for the rest of his life... but it's probably impossible. Anyway, thanks for your review!"
Thimbleweed Park,Wait... did you say Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick?
Thimbleweed Park,"I've been looking forward to your review as I have had this game on my radar for quite a while now.... 
glad it got a solid ""buy"""
Thimbleweed Park,"""You shouldn't pay more than $20 for a video game"" -Guybrush Threepwood"
Thimbleweed Park,Nice to see a point and click game getting some love.
Thimbleweed Park,This reminds me of the monkey island and broken sword games. I might get it cheers good review
Thimbleweed Park,"Great review, thanks!"
Thimbleweed Park,"That clown seems annoying, I just wanted to play as fake Mulder and Skully"
Thimbleweed Park,Can we agree that ACG is the best reviewer ever?
Thimbleweed Park,"I'm very early, still great review as always!"
Thimbleweed Park,early af
Thimbleweed Park,First
Strange Horticulture,"Well done me for choosing this review and the next to be on games with constant potential for spoilers, making it really tricky to pick out usuable clips. Luckily for the next one I can record some footage of walking around the neat environment and that should solve the problem haha"
Strange Horticulture,"Strange Horticulture, Papers Please & Do Not Feed The Monkeys are my 3 favorite point & click titles on Steam. All similar yet so uniquely different."
Strange Horticulture,"Hmh have you played ""No Umbrellas Allowed""?"
Strange Horticulture,Ah I love your voice
Strange Horticulture,Does it work well on the switch or would it be better to buy it on pc?
Strange Horticulture,"I don't like the music, it's pretty repetitive, as well as the gameplay I guess. Also, I guess if you don't like ""Paper Please"" you won't like this title much."
Strange Horticulture,Reminds me of Valhalla just making drinks and enjoying the narrative.
Strange Horticulture,"Nice review, thanks.

If you are still looking, Potion Craft is a similar game."
Strange Horticulture,"I enjoyed this game, a relaxing detective game about plants. I think you should mute the game sounds and put music on as a backing track to your audio, there were a lot of jarring musical cuts in this review. Otherwise well done, thank you"
Strange Horticulture,p̶r̶o̶m̶o̶s̶m̶ 🤷
Strange Horticulture,"I tried this out earlier this year and loved the atmosphere as well. It felt cozy, and a little foreboding."
Strange Horticulture,You know that I know Dis Pontibus 2 was released :)))))
Strange Horticulture,"I really enjoyed this game, but I was never able to go back to finish it. The puzzles sometimes went over my head, so I felt bad for looking at a guide here and there. 

I know you're likely to play it soon, but Obra Dinn really is a great detective game as well, just in its own ways. 

Nice line at the end, leaf out of your book lmao.  Very nice video!"
Strange Horticulture,"Your recommendations never fail me. Thank you, looking forward to try this one :)"
Strange Horticulture,This game looks and sounds awesome! I'll have to throw the OST on if I can find it!
Strange Horticulture,"Great review, game looks very relaxing. I will definitely pick this up when I will want some game just to vibe to."
Strange Horticulture,Btw did you already check out dis pontibus 2? I remember you reviewed the first one
Strange Horticulture,Love your reviews. So well written and honestly a great way to experience games I'm never going to get time to play.
Strange Horticulture,Very surprising that the map used is where I grew up in Cumbria!
Strange Horticulture,The third river card/clue was game breaking for me.
Strange Horticulture,Surprisingly enjoyable game that I picked up after watching this video. I wouldn’t have otherwise known about it. Glad I got the chance to play this gem of a game!
Strange Horticulture,"It's so good, def my game of the year!"
Strange Horticulture,looks really cool.
Eastward,Sams Theme is truly a masterpiece
Eastward,Is this available for Android?
Eastward,animation looks French as heck
Eastward,Hey you soft-censored my comment. Wtf IGN? 🤪
Eastward,Meanwhile Hogwarts gets a 9 lol
Eastward,A true masterpeice 10/10
Eastward,Thanks xbox gamepass so much 🍻🍻
Eastward,It was such a beautiful experience.
Eastward,"there's times you sit back and go ""wow, this game is made by 3 people"" and other times where it's like ""wow, this games is definitely made by 3 people""."
Eastward,My game of the year
Eastward,The game kinda reminds me of spirited away hehe
Eastward,50% of my play time came from playing Earth Born so much (which is like 30hours). 😅
Eastward,FYI Zelda IS a JRPG.
Eastward,It's on game pass!!! Yyyyaaaassss!
Eastward,Now on GamePass as of 12/1/2022!
Eastward,"How are you enjoying it?? It doesn't tell you what to do, theres no map"
Eastward,just bought it! thanks!
Eastward,Fun sized The Last of Us haha
Eastward,At least a 9.
Eastward,GIVES ME new age stardew valley vibes
Eastward,"Eastward’s greatest weakness is ALL THE DIALOGUE. This game is a colossal waste of time. 10% adventure, 10% fighting, 80% slow burning garbage story and dialogue."
Eastward,Really want to play this… debating on the physical
Eastward,Finally cheaper retail release 😃
Eastward,One of my favorite game of all time. Love the story.
Eastward,Why isn't this on Playstation!?
Eastward,Great review...very indepth!  This was like reading the manual but more fun :)  Do people even read manuals anymore though...lol.  Great job on your video :)
Eastward,"Cooking/making food such as hot items, pre made dinners, following recipes as well as weighing items. ⛄"
Eastward,Ign stop comparing games to Zelda or dark souls challenge
Eastward,does this game have co-op?
Eastward,This all they had to do the pokemon line
Eastward,Reminds me of the anime Sakugan. A father and adopted daughter with powers in a post apocalyptic world.
Eastward,Buy this game on PC if you can. It runs like crap on switch.
Eastward,The incessant and meaningless dialogue in this game really killed it for me
Eastward,Excellent review ! Thank you for this
Eastward,somehow this very positive review talked me out of the game. weird.
Eastward,"To me, the weird dialog from Characters is extremely charming. The over written Lines from characters aren't a masterpiece but it kinda makes you feel at home within the world."
Eastward,"The game is about 13 hours too long. But, hey, if you LOVE fetch quests, go ahead and buy it."
Eastward,Game is such a drag. Hours and hours of dialog that dont explain anything
Eastward,"""Fights are simple, and most enemies can be easily defeated""... Meanwhile he's getting destroyed in every single clip lol."
Eastward,"Can anyone recomend getting this on PC or Switch?  Any longer load-times on the Switch or issues with controls, anything that makes it a better purchase on Steam?"
Eastward,This game is classic! Cant wait for westward or an earth born game
Eastward,"Adventures of Chief Hopper and Eleven, post apocalypse."
Eastward,will this ever be on ps4
Eastward,"This dude failed to mention about the really amazing soundtrack this game has.

""Bad review"" 3/10 -IGN"
Eastward,"Its patronising, not PAYtronising"
Eastward,Does anybody tried this game on a M1 chip Macbook? Is the performance all right?
Eastward,"The art and music are great and that is about it. This game is so easy and linear. Its literally look on your map, walk to marker, talk to someone/ slap some monsters, look on map, repeat. The game is just 1 storyline. The 30 playhours are more like 10 because al the long long long dialog which have no propose as to tell you a story. And you cant skip the dialog and cutscenes which sometimes take 5-10 mins. You dont need to read it for clues or anything. Its almost if you read a book and sometimes can walk and slap some enemies. And the more you progress to the end of the game the more and longer dialogs you need to endure. If this sounds like a fun game to you than play it. Otherwise think twice before buying."
Eastward,This really reminds me of Alundra!
Eastward,This is a must buy
Eastward,"Eh, looks too indie for me."
Eastward,"id love to believe you , but your movie review of carnage has me skeptical .... no actually this game is really fun. maybe invest in someone new for the movies or drop them lol"
Eastward,"If only she was taken advantaged of sexually by the guy, and her being able to come back and kill him as a boss. That's be epic"
Eastward,The graphic reminds me of Earthbound.
Eastward,He didn't even mentioned the soundtrack jeez
Eastward,"It would have been nice to have a review where you don't use other game titles as describing words, at least explain what you mean when you bring up similar games."
Eastward,best game!
Eastward,I'm so sick of these generic art styles and the nostalgia bait.
Eastward,Looks beautiful. Definitely a chill out iPad or switch game for me though.
Eastward,Sam finally wearing shoes shed a tear on my eye
Eastward,"had been an omori killer, butched the end tho / still a little gold piece in the sea of indie rpgs"
Eastward,why do people keep comparing it to Earthbound? That game has like no story and the characters are basically pieces of cardboard who dont even make up for the main protagonists silence with compelling side characters. Mother 3 would be a more accurate comparison
Eastward,"5:23 For everything ""eltse""? Bro aren't you a journalist?"
Eastward,Im 7 hours into it and yes it’s beautiful but kinda boring to me. The dialogs are a drag
Eastward,Reviewer is making me sleepy 😴
Eastward,2:50 100% agreed
Eastward,When this game coming out?
Eastward,It looks cool the main characters and combat just don't speak to me.
Eastward,nah this is like EARTHBOUND not zelda
Eastward,been waiting for this to be released just bought it on switch!
Eastward,This is what people want for games these days? This looks like any other 2D top down game. Why are you people so obsessed with this?
Eastward,This game is 10/10 for me periodttt.
Eastward,Great job with the review. That was one of the best I’ve seen/read in quite some time.
Eastward,Replayability?
Eastward,Deathloop gets a 10 but this game gets an EIGHT????????????????
Eastward,"Persona has the same problem, 3 sentences when 1 is descriptive enough."
Eastward,This game looks great!
Eastward,This game looks so calming 😊
Eastward,"You describe the game as being ""picaresque,"" and then call the 2 main characters loveable. >_>"
Eastward,Mobile release date?
Eastward,"pleasantly surprised at the lack of Anti Chinese comments here, as this is a Shanghai based studio :) beautiful game"
Eastward,bro zelda is a jrpg
Eastward,you cant blame the wording as the company is mainly a Chinese dev? some time translation from mandarin to English can be wonky.
Eastward,"This game is perfectly fit for switch, I’m loving it and lying on my bed with this amazing game."
Eastward,"Ive had the steam bookmark for this game saved for over 2 years, couldnt wait for it to come out."
Eastward,"Beautiful game, soundtrack is awesome too. But I'm 3 hours in and I'm almost bored to tears. Feel like you really need to be in the mood for an incredibly drawn out narrative and its charm. Gameplay wise, this doesn't have much going for it."
Eastward,"And Kickloop gets a 10/10 ?  :D 


I give this Channel a 3/10"
Eastward,"This is a genuine surprise! Don't be fooled by the pixel art style, it is very gorgeous and lovely to look at, gameplay-wise, simple but still quite challenging, highly recommend it to everyone!"
Eastward,Reminds me of the movie firestarter
Eastward,Well I’m sold
Eastward,Game of the year?
Eastward,It's no deathloopzzzzzzz...
Eastward,“Well designed weirdos” are my favourite type of characters
Eastward,"This review is well-written and delivery informative without fluff, while still showing some personality. I’m a fan of yours now, Jon. Thank you for this nice presentation."
Eastward,the game is locked in 720p sad....
Eastward,My GOTY for me! 10/10
Eastward,10/10
Eastward,"It's boring as hell, too many dialogue 🤮"
Eastward,The bad writing is probably because of the fact that this is an indie game and the devs are Chinese and English aren't their native language.
Eastward,"For everyone that finished it, if you had to rate how much this game made you cry from 1 to 10 how would your rate it? (Mother 3 rates about 8 for me)"
Eastward,Modern Earthbound vibes! Think I'll pick this one up soon
Eastward,great review
Eastward,Thanks xbox gamepass
Eastward,It reminds me a lot of Secret of Mana mixed with Link to the Past puzzles and an Earthbound-esque storyline.
Eastward,Thanks gamepass
Eastward,Every negative point you made is actually a feature and what makes the game great.
Eastward,"I wanted to love this game… but this ultimately ended up being one of my LEAST favorite games of all time. After 10 hours of being optimistic that it would get better… I drudged through the final 15 hours and finally beat it. 

PROS: Graphics 

CONS: Just about everything else. Extremely repetitive music, long dialogue after long boring dialogue, the story takes 20 hours to get interesting and then the final 5 hours of actual story is honestly just confusing and left me not caring at all."
Eastward,This game wishes it could be Zelda. It is one of the most boring and frustrating games I've played in a while. If you think this game is good you are easily manipulated.
Eastward,"This game has great moments...but it's EXTREMELY wordy.  It has a lot of areas that are just plain repetitive and has a really shitty habit of punishing you for exploring by locking you out of finding unlockables by pushing you through a cutscene. 

The dialogue can be EXTREMELY boring at times and beats you over the head with something."
Eastward,"I just finished the game a few seconds ago and immediately tried to look for some explanation on some parts of the game that I have yet to understand, but this game... oh my aching hearttttttttt........beautiful story, an experience I've never had with much pixel games."
Eastward,"Great game. Really cool characters, very weird story. The music totally sucked me in. I find that if I play 1 or 2 hours at a time I can enjoy it and the dialogue doesn’t get too overbearing"
Eastward,"Pretty much exactly how I felt about the game. It's really good, but. . ."
Eastward,"Maybe I will slowly chip away at it, the story was engaging but no story in a game is good enough to make the player feel good about just sitting there reading dialogue for ages at a time only to be given back control for extremely linear direction and very simple puzzles and almost irrelevant combat.

A lot of the positive and negative steam reviews mention that 70% of the game is cut scenes and that sentiment definitely comes across very quickly. I knew this going in figuring it was a bit exaggerated, it wasn't. The story is good but the gameplay leaves a lot to be desired and just made the points between story beats feel like a chore put there for the sake of it"
Eastward,"What a game. I want Pixpil's next project already. My only gripe is the ending is vague, lacks depth and falls a little flat."
Eastward,This game will have been much better with turn based battles.
Eastward,"I definitely wish the combat offered more, turn based would been cool. With skills or something."
Eastward,Great review thanks. I love they are concise and to the point
Eastward,Another quirky earthbound inspired rpg i dont even care if its good or not at this point cause they made so many
Eastward,"I like this game, but one thing to take into consideration...you will spend way more time reading dialogue boxes than playing a game. You will be begging for the text to stop because the gaming is fun and there is just not enough of it."
Eastward,"I keep hearing reveiwers talk about how they never really used sam but i used her constantly during my playthrough, like if your surrounded by enemys you cant get out of that with weapons alone. Also on the prospect of the combat being simple i think that derives from reveiwers not really using sam."
Eastward,"You spent most of the review saying ""meh"" then said it was incredible at the last moment."
Eastward,"“If you’re ok with long dialogues…”

Enter persona players"
Eastward,based game
Eastward,"Whoa, what happened at 2:48 ? It sounds like you got possessed by the devil for a couple seconds when you said , "". . . didn't work for me.""  Hahaha"
Eastward,"Finally a real review, not blinded by pixels. Played the first chapter and I want a refund, 2 hours of filler dialog, story makes no sense, the 10 minutes of gameplay was boring. Too bad I got it for switch"
Eastward,"Man I am so dissapointed by the game, it is so incredibly basic on gameplay and the endless cutscenes and pointless amount of dialogue make it so boring, damn I was so hyped, wish a it was a lot better than this because the visuals and the music are on point."
Eastward,"The story of this game has the hallmark of a Japanese manga like Alita: Battle Angle. It is deep, emotional, innocence, conflicting, controversial and mysterious. Sam’s origin, her daughter-father-like relationship with John, the mix of her power and her innocence view of a post apocalyptic world."
Eastward,"I love this game, it feels like watching a manga with some comedy moments sprinkled in between. The pace might be slow but the beautiful music and environment ambience details really make you want to slow down to take it all in anyway."
Eastward,"Unless its metal gear, i dont have the patience for long dialogue in games. Ill pass. Got diablo 2 next week anyway."
Eastward,Terrible voice for a review.
Eastward,If this game had full voice acting I would be in heaven. I love the world and characters i just hate reading so much. 😂
Eastward,Hopefully they do some updates on pc
Eastward,imagine releasing a game in 2021 that doesnt even run in 1080p
Eastward,I wanted this to be an rpg
Eastward,"Looks cool. However, I have been looking for a reason to go back and finally finish Hollow Knight."
Eastward,I don’t know why but this game gives me Earthbound vibes
Eastward,Welcome Elise!
Eastward,"This is a story heavy driven game and I fucking LOVE IT! The art style, dialog, and gameplay are all very nice. Super chill game to just play and not get stressed, we are in no rush here...definitely talk to everyone all the time, their responses are both funny and entertaining. This gives me AKIRA, Stranger Things, Ghibli, and Gravity Falls vibes...I have not stopped playing it since I was able to boot it up on my Switch day 1."
Eastward,I was worried about the gameplay being sloggish...
Eastward,Thanks for saving me $24.99
Eastward,This reviewer seems like a negative Nancy.  Had a hard time listening to it.  I get that everyone has their opinion but it feels.... harsh?
Eastward,first time ever buying a game not for its gameplay but for its music. absolutely stunning.
Eastward,Great review
Eastward,"So if I got it right, it's like if Zelda: a Link to the  Past and Earthbound had a child? If that's it I'm stocked, I've been waiting for years for a Mother 3 sequel or a new 2d Zelda"
Eastward,"Welcome to 3MR! Thanks for the review. Excited to see more reviews from you, Elise"
Eastward,Hot take: top down Zelda combat has always been repetitive and basic. I'm good with it.
Eastward,The Last of Us Lite
Eastward,Preloaded on my switch. Can’t wait for tomorrow to be able to play! This game pixel art is damn gorgeous
Eastward,"I hate it when enemies respawn when you reenter an area...I wish every game would do it like Diablo 2 (and its 'clones') and just have enemies respawn when you exit the game, and then reenter."
Eastward,"This is why the Escapist is my go to for game info. Thorough, with both praises and criticisms."
Eastward,"I don't mind long dialogue to some extend but not a big fan of caricature in this game, using caricatures is a tricky business, can be seen as a lazy and offensive most of the time.

Mm i would probaby wait for a sale then."
Eastward,happy to have a new reviewer on board especially since he brought up many good points honestly I would still play this even with all the flaws
Eastward,"Glad to to hear it ended up so good. All the concerns raised aren't really a bother to me, sometimes all you want is a good retread, more Zelda but not actually Zelda."
Eastward,"Great review Elise. Sounds like the game hooked you in and didn't leave you cold, so that's a plus. Your criticisms reflect a seasoned gamer not easily impressed. I thought it was a balanced review."
Eastward,"damn, this game is unbearable beautiful. it literally physically hurts me to never be able to create such amazing pixel art no matter how many thousand hours I would try."
Eastward,"surprised its coming out, all I'd seen was a teaser trailer. bit bummed based on the review but maybe I'll wait for a sale. welcome Elise!"
Eastward,"Probably a game to miss for me, but this does make me think I should watch more 3MR..."
Eastward,That's a great review! On point and well paced. Provides all necessary information but is never dry. Can't wait for more from Elise! Welcome!
Eastward,This game looks amazing.
Eastward,Perfect switch in bed game!
Eastward,"Sorry to blast the new person, but this is my least favourite review. The opening sentence is generic and vague and the voice is too quiet and monotone. The script thankfully gets tighter towards the end. Hopefully they get better."
Eastward,"welcome to the Escapist, Elise! good review also!"
Eastward,"I'm willing to read the long dialogue if it's engaging enough, alot of these old school style games have simpler more naturally written dialogue and just let's me play with what I think they sound like in my head.  I think I'll delve in for sure. Maybe not immediately... I just picked up bio mutant on sale as a palate cleanser from skyward sword, I need something open after being stuck on a linear path for sooooooooo loooooooong. From what I see this seems fairly linear, which I have no problem with. But I need a tad more distance from skyward...."
Eastward,"Welcome to the 3MR crew, Elise! This game isn't for me, but I really enjoyed watching your review :)

Edit: spelling snafu"
Eastward,Just wanted to welcome the new reviewer to the channel. Looking forward to your future work for the escapist Elise.
Eastward,The graphics look absolutley gorgeous.
Eastward,"It's always weird to know that many games out there play story as ""somewhat happy and peaceful... on the surface,"" but I know that no story is without conflict."
Eastward,"""Review copy provided by publisher"""
Eastward,Thanks for playing Elise 🙏 Repetitive puzzles and combat can really drag a game down when those are really the loops you experience. Glad to hear it was an overall decent experience 🍻 Cheers and hope you're as well as you can be!
Eastward,bummed that they went for the cliche silent man + magic girl duo instead of just making Sam the protagonist. appreciate your critiques of the character writing!
Eastward,Preordered
Eastward,"""If you wanna play Earth Born, you're gonna have to get in line"" hmm..what game does that remind me of? Which also happens to feature cutesy characters roaming around a rural town, fighting off equally cutesy enemies and roaming wildlife? I guess a ""mothers"" influence never dies ;)"
Eastward,Lol so I feel like you were sending me some mixed feelings on this. I already preordered and excited to see if I like it.
Hypnospace Outlaw,Oh no... He didnt know about shaking the mouse to have stuff load faster
Hypnospace Outlaw,03:55 Neat how they combined this with Slayers X: Terminal Aftermath Vengance of the Slayer with Zane. LOL! 😝😝💯💯🍻🍻
Hypnospace Outlaw,Having just finished Civvie's coverage of Slayer X... I didn't expect this to be where it started.
Hypnospace Outlaw,"I can't wait to see you cover the spin-off ""Slayers X"" where Zane is the star. lol"
Hypnospace Outlaw,You know what's even cooler????? As someone else that has listened to almost all of these?? This. Also why is everyone video 5 years old...every one. Nothing new?
Hypnospace Outlaw,Human Rayman Speaks About Hypnospace
Hypnospace Outlaw,"The kid being banned from the Pokemon expy hit really close to home for me, my step father was a religious extremist who was also a high school drop out. So he thought witchcraft was real. I remember one day we came home from school, and we were sat down and told that we weren't allowed to like Pokemon or Yu-Gi-Oh anymore. He even took final Fantasy 4 away from me because there were mages in it."
Hypnospace Outlaw,"Hey you remember that Zane kid?
Yeah apparently his comic inspired a first person shooter in the hypnospace outlaw universe"
Hypnospace Outlaw,Been playing this game over and over finding new stuff each and every time. I can't wait for Dreamsettler it looks interesting from the teaser.
Hypnospace Outlaw,"Fun Fact: Zane's ""girlfriend"" is actually him on an alternate account. If you check his headband ID, then his girl's, you'll find out they're the same ID."
Hypnospace Outlaw,"So apparently there's coming a shooter now. I dunno if it's made by any of the same people, but I know ya' play as zane and zane hates squishers, and you wield a gun that fires glass."
Hypnospace Outlaw,"This was such an amazing game, the best part of the game is that you can look around, you aren't really in a hurry for anything besides the game does encourage you to explore all just to finish the archive"
Hypnospace Outlaw,"Heartwrenchingspace Outlaw, from the mind behind Dropsy."
Hypnospace Outlaw,perfect!
Hypnospace Outlaw,perfect!
Hypnospace Outlaw,...did Rad just... _completely_ miss the whole _”wildly jerk your mouse around to make pages load faster”_ thing?
Hypnospace Outlaw,"And here we are after 3 years, the spin off sequel is coming soon: Slayers X . . . The actual comic from Zane in this game is now it's own game. Good Lord, how the lore runs deep."
Hypnospace Outlaw,Was that a yume 2kki reference-
Hypnospace Outlaw,Dude there’s a new hypnospace outlaw sequel called dream settler it ain’t out yet but be patient also slayers x
Hypnospace Outlaw,0:47 Man do I love Scott the Woz's inyernet and you
Hypnospace Outlaw,Yume 2kki sheep 0:53
Hypnospace Outlaw,Nitro Rad looks so chilled out in the thumbnail and with a voice like that he could do guided meditations and sleep stories.
Hypnospace Outlaw,0:54 Tari can do that but it' resembles a petit mal seizure.
Hypnospace Outlaw,"My only problem with the game was leakypipes. I had no idea it existed, and didn’t feel like there was anything that pointed at it. Sure, there’s one mention of it, ONE (as far as i know) but it’s put beside other things that didn’t seem to have any website directly related to it. I think an improvement to it could be more tags on the website, more mentions of it, or give the leakypipes text a direct link to the website. Otherwise, it just feels like a “hey, remember that one sentence that you immediately forgot and seem to have no meaning? Well now it’s crucial to completion” kind of situation. It really sucked too, cuz it was the only thing i needed to search for online."
Hypnospace Outlaw,"Hey niro, a sequel was just announced called Dream Settler, it's up on Steam if you want to check it out. There was also a game about Zane Rocks was just announced aswell."
Hypnospace Outlaw,"Why would anyone prefer a version with DRM over a version without DRM? You cannot truly buy the game if it has DRM because with DRM you will never own it. ""Buying"" a game with DRM is like buying a car but the owner keeping the keys so that you have to ask him for permission anytime you want to ride in ""your"" car."
Hypnospace Outlaw,he looks like jerma in the thumbnail wtf
Hypnospace Outlaw,2:45 i've heard the soud of true tranquility in my mind
Hypnospace Outlaw,This feels Ena like
Hypnospace Outlaw,It’s also on xbox gamepass right now!
Hypnospace Outlaw,Very trippy sounding game. I wanna try!
Hypnospace Outlaw,the transition from normal gameplay to free play mode in this is amazing
Hypnospace Outlaw,he does realize that zane's gf is fake
Hypnospace Outlaw,I've seen enough Isekai to know that jacking your subconscious into the internets is a baaaad idea... can't wait to try it.
Hypnospace Outlaw,The captions say this game is available on HBO
Hypnospace Outlaw,"look at this noob, he's not violently wiggling his mouse cursor to speed up page loading!"
Hypnospace Outlaw,"I couldn't have praised this game's impeccable style of ""environmental"" storytelling better myself. Heck, I didn't even piece together the heartbreaking Squisherz fanart story until you discussed it."
Hypnospace Outlaw,The ending of this game... Oh my god.
Hypnospace Outlaw,the motorcycle dude’s wife made me feel things. i hugged my gf after i read it.
Hypnospace Outlaw,"Y2K
You let me down, down
You let me down down down down down down down down down"
Hypnospace Outlaw,I bought this a year or so ago on my switch after playing a demo version first that is how I first discovered it randomly browsing the Nintendo eshop .. I love the game I got right near the end of the game (I think ) after *spoiler . Things happened. I haven't played it much after that because I got stuck lol
Hypnospace Outlaw,This looks great. Im surprised Tim and Erik weren't involved
Hypnospace Outlaw,"I downloaded prof. Helper, didn’t think it helped and uninstalled it, then found it on sherris page by ordering her services. Now I feel dumb."
Hypnospace Outlaw,Wish I could have my mind erased so I could experience it again
Hypnospace Outlaw,"I love how wiggling the mouse to make things load faster is an actual gameplay mechanic. There are a lot of instances of the game being true to life, but that really hits home."
Hypnospace Outlaw,"Is this game a good spiritual successor to LA Noire, in a sense? I know you can't really interview people, but if you got that itch to solve a mystery or the like, would this satisfy those cravings, so to speak? :)"
Hypnospace Outlaw,James I don't know if you take requests but i recently started playing a indie game Called Don't Feed the Monkeys it seems like a game you would like check it out!
Hypnospace Outlaw,I completely missed the Squisherz art contest! Goes to show that this game is crammed full of hidden gems
Hypnospace Outlaw,I love these games. Like games set in a computer. Something like Emily is away. It’s set I. An old computer. Anyone got any other games like this?
Hypnospace Outlaw,"Late, I know, but the Itch release comes with a Steam key! Most indie games that release on both stores do this. You can have your cake and eat it too :)"
Hypnospace Outlaw,"Imagine a speedrun where you have to delete every single kind of content, even if it doesn't break the rules. It would be total hell."
Hypnospace Outlaw,That Gex: Enter the Gecko level selection map music
Hypnospace Outlaw,"With the loading, you can actually speed it way up by wiggling the mouse."
Hypnospace Outlaw,"No,  Granny Cream’s Hot Butter Ice Cream?"
Hypnospace Outlaw,HAS THAT 80S GUY GOT A FUCKKING *PSVR*
Hypnospace Outlaw,You literally showed me one of my favorite games ever made. You kick so much ass James!
Hypnospace Outlaw,What a beautiful game.
Hypnospace Outlaw,"This game is SO NitroRad material, I'm glad you covered it.
Also that poor girl noooooooo"
Hypnospace Outlaw,"Fun Fact! There's a page in Hypnospace designed by the creator of Hypnospace Outlaw where, for a small fee, you can get hints and sometimes the solution to most of the puzzles in the game. Just enter 'hint' into the search bar."
Hypnospace Outlaw,"I hope there's a sequel set in CyberworldZ. Merchantsoft's story is over, but it'd be awesome to see the competitor and browse even more weird sites. Regardless of whether or not that happens, Jay Tholen is a dev I'll be keeping an eye on for the rest of my life."
Hypnospace Outlaw,Omg i died at the beginning xD xD
Hypnospace Outlaw,"Just finished this game on my Switch. I know PC's are the ideal way to play this one, but whatever. I really loved this game. Hypnospace Outlaw has quickly become one of my favourite indie games ever. It's attention to detail is astounding, and figuring out each case was one of the most rewarding experiences. Hats off to Jay and his team, as well as every content creator who contributed."
Hypnospace Outlaw,"just do u know zanes ""Girl friend"" was never real. you can figure this out by looking to see that both pages come from the same ip"
Hypnospace Outlaw,"Huh. This game hit the ps store last moth or so and got completely overlooked, I think. 😟"
Hypnospace Outlaw,The beginning was actually really funny
Hypnospace Outlaw,"I saw this game on Xbox game pass the other day. I got it and beat it in around 2-3 hours (with a guide). I recommend playing as much as possible without one.

I think I got up to the festering orfice case before resorting to a guide (the case where a virus causing your screen and such like to be corrupted) and it was still fun none the less. If you can, play it without a guide though. 

Edit: it’s the true tranquility case

Although use one at the end when you get the Sam hammer and are on the final case, it gets really tricky and very where-do-I-go if you know what I mean (also I’m a tad shit at really ‘find this tiny clue’ puzzles so ye).


Great story, great characters, the alternate Y2K bug parody (although it acknowledges Y2K) causing the problem was cool, and really neat how (SPOILERS) happens if you choose to ( SPOILERS) in the 3rd act is really cool."
Hypnospace Outlaw,00.35 I thought he was about to say Nord vpn and I was about to skip
Hypnospace Outlaw,"I actually went the entire game without taking down copyrighted material or things involving harassment,I only took down things that are blatantly illegal and I actually got pretty far that way..."
Hypnospace Outlaw,I'm so happy that this game got a Switch port that works amazingly
Hypnospace Outlaw,"man I really loved Hypnospace Outlaw. That game made me feel things. It's probably the best written game I've every played, all the characters feel so real and the story is fantastic"
Hypnospace Outlaw,"I can't wait to try it out, I love the 90's internet vibe"
Hypnospace Outlaw,Aincrad.
Hypnospace Outlaw,11:54 oh my sweet summer child.
Hypnospace Outlaw,I just played the demo on Switch. It really has to be played with a mouse on a PC as the controls with an analogstick is really exhausting. The game got annoying after five minutes but after watching your review it really took my interest to buy it for my computer. Thanks James!
Hypnospace Outlaw,"Fun fact: Zane's headband ID is the same as his girlfriend's. Cory's headband ID is also the same as his girlfriend's.

Bwl."
Hypnospace Outlaw,"After watching this review I wanted to grab this game for the longest time, but my laptop is basically a potato chip. Luckily it released on consoles not too long ago so I grabbed the PS4 version and... man, you weren't kidding. This really is something special. The authenticity, world building and structure of it all is fantastic. I intended to try it for a few minutes before heading to sleep last night and ended up playing until 2 am just because of how invested I was. Such a unique premise on top of an incredible execution, mixed with that perfect amount of nostalgia for those of us who were just growing up when the internet was in its infancy. Thanks for bringing this to my attention, dude!"
Hypnospace Outlaw,“It’s so unafraid.....” oh yeah.... cause I definitely was when that orriface shot happend
Hypnospace Outlaw,My man thinks Zane had a girlfriend in the first place
Hypnospace Outlaw,This game is now on Xbox one through Game Pass if anyone only has Xbox one and wants to play this. I came back to this video cause remembered seeing the name somewhere before and it was you nitro rad who made my final decision to download this and give it a whirl once its done downloading
Hypnospace Outlaw,"3:06 I disagree, I find it actually adds to that 90s novelty aesthetic feel without being overly cumbersome like actual 90s download times were. Anybody else remember leaving their computer on for a week just to download a game or a movie?"
Hypnospace Outlaw,that rayman hoodie looks comfy :3
Hypnospace Outlaw,"*Anyway, I took the hot butter and mixed it with the ice cr-*"
Hypnospace Outlaw,I can't wait to play on my switch
Hypnospace Outlaw,I farted u💞
Hypnospace Outlaw,"wait, the game has a physical copy??"
Hypnospace Outlaw,This man is actually wearing ray man's hoodie
Hypnospace Outlaw,"I teared up about the little girl story, wow I'll definitely going to give this game a try"
Hypnospace Outlaw,Do more rpg maker games
Hypnospace Outlaw,fun fact: shaing the cursor around while the assets are loading will actually make the assets load faster
Hypnospace Outlaw,"""You see them enter and exit relationships""

*shows Zane's super not real girlfriend as an example*

ummmm..."
Hypnospace Outlaw,"Can we make squishiers a real game, before we then make 5 trillion spinoffs....."
Hypnospace Outlaw,I thought the opening was a nordvpn ad
Hypnospace Outlaw,I mean who doesn't love Zane?
Hypnospace Outlaw,I loved the 90's commercial aesthetic of that intro! Right down to the cheesy acting
Hypnospace Outlaw,He didn't know about the cursor wiggle. Heh.
Hypnospace Outlaw,haha that IRL photo of Zane is me in the 8th grade! I made it! Ma! I'm in a video game!!
Hypnospace Outlaw,The end was so surprising and sad
Hypnospace Outlaw,"Hey, fun fact, Zanes girlfriend is fake, just look at the url for them both"
Hypnospace Outlaw,Hey check the headband ID of Zane and then his gf and compare them
Hypnospace Outlaw,Am I the only one that wants squisherZ to be an actual game.
Hypnospace Outlaw,"This video is amazing man, keep it up!"
Hypnospace Outlaw,Hey just wanted to tell you I know this video didn't pick up but I really appreciate this video and hope you continue making videos and get some real attention for the effort you put in. Keep it up❤
Hypnospace Outlaw,If you're bored of waiting for dream settler you should play Slayer X it's a game made by Zane if he lives
Hypnospace Outlaw,"So fun fact about the console versions, at least with the switch one. While they are very doable to play with a controller and even touch screen in switch's handheld mode, if your console has available USB ports and a usb mouse/keyboard hanging around you can plug them into your consoles and use them to play the game like the PC version. So you can still experiences the simulation the way it's meant to be played if you don't have a PC or you don't wanna use it for games."
Hypnospace Outlaw,"Amazing video, I love this game and eat up any videos about it. Enjoyed it a lot, would love more videos about this game and it's side characters!"
Hypnospace Outlaw,Ending the video with Granny Cream's Hot Butter Ice Cream was perfect!
Hypnospace Outlaw,Hypnospacre Outlaw is the first game I've played where I went out of my way to 100% and get all achievements for. I cannot wait to play Dreamsettler.
Hypnospace Outlaw,An excellent video for an amazing game. Thank you.
Hypnospace Outlaw,Something to note about the switch version. You can plug a keyboard and mouse into the dock and play it as if you were playing it on PC. I don't get why more devs don't support that.
Hypnospace Outlaw,"I watched Vinny play it when it came out so I'm spoiled so I'm gonna just play the sequel

The alternate reality stuff reminds me of disco Elysium and how that game has tech that looks like stuff we had in the 70s but works completely differently"
Hypnospace Outlaw,"Wow, watched through this video thinking ""How long ago was this made, this video is really good, probably has millions of views!"" scrolled down, only 3000? Only April 2022? Holy sh&t!

Keep doing what you're doing man, I hope the algorithm gives your sails some wind. This video is really really cool."
Hypnospace Outlaw,so excited for dreamsettler
Hypnospace Outlaw,"This game is so cool, you can penalize an elementary school teacher from the start"
Hypnospace Outlaw,"0:00-0:04
Is that phrase in some sort of YouTuber's guidebook? I've heard that from countless YouTubers countless times."
Hypnospace Outlaw,great video! you and this game deserve more attention
Hypnospace Outlaw,God. I havent gotten so emotional over fake people before
Hypnospace Outlaw,Incredible video. I hope one day you can delve into the side characters and stories because it feels like an absolute iceberg
Hypnospace Outlaw,"Great video, Hypnospace is my all time favorite video game, the more people that discover the game the better!"
Hypnospace Outlaw,I’ve been patiently waiting for the day when YouTubers other than Vinesauce discover this game and start making some good videos on it. That day is finally here and life is now worth living.
Hypnospace Outlaw,this game went from 1 to 100 unexpectedly
Hypnospace Outlaw,"You can actually save some of the users who died, how? Perma banning them."
Hypnospace Outlaw,"Found this video while looking for Hypnospace mods.
I've known a lot about Hypnospace before getting my hands on it, I knew what was going to happen yet I still felt nervous about it all.

What I love about this game that not a lot of people point out is how easy it is to expand Hypnospace thanks to the Page Builder and Tune Sequencer, to the point that entire zones can be created if anyone wanted to, which is extremely darn cool, being able to create whole sites and add even way more to the world of Hypnospace.

I am so excited to play Dream Settler and I really hope it has the same (or even more somehow) amount of personalization that HSO has. Excellent work here.'"
Hypnospace Outlaw,Convinced me to check it out and you deserve more views :)
Hypnospace Outlaw,Haha nice.
Hypnospace Outlaw,"Absolutely fantastic video! I agree, Hypnospace is such an underrated gem... How you described the story had it all coming back to me, haha. Heres to Dreamsettler! :D

P.s. Hoping this video takes off in the algo, it was very good <3"
Hypnospace Outlaw,"The guide during Enforcer training pronounces HypnOS as ""Hypno Ess"".

Also, the Dream Settler announcement really gets me, and not just because I love Hypnospace Outlaw. It's set in ""an alternate-reality 2003""... but is it _just_ the alternate reality we're _familiar_ with, the one in which Hypnospace exists/existed? Or is it an alternate reality _of that_ alternate reality? What we read in the present day section of the Hypnospace Archival Project suggests that the Mindcrash (and general complaints of migraines and poor sleep) pretty much killed not only Merchantsoft and Hypnospace but also ""sleeptime/dreamtime computing"" _as a technology._

... But the name ""Dream Settler"" implies that this 2003 sleeptime service is connected to *_Merchantsoft's_*_ regular, used-while-awake internet service, NetSettler._

If this is an ""alternate-reality-squared"", that raises a lot of interesting questions. Was there no Mindcrash? Was there no _Hypnospace,_ the '90s were (relatively) normal and _the early 2000s_ were the world's introduction to sleeptime computing? Did Merchantsoft just spin-off NetSettler into its own company after the Mindcrash so they could jump ship, let Merchantsoft and Hypnospace burn, and try to bring sleeptime back in a few years when things ""cooled off""?

... Did the Dream Settler team _fix or minimize_ any of the sleep problems that the HAP will uncover in about 20 years, or are they still on the same hardware?

And how does Hypnospace's old rival, CyberWorldZ, fit in? Are _they_ still around in any form, or did the Mindcrash still kill them, leaving Dream Settler with a natural monopoly on sleeptime internet?

Sorry, I'm rambling. BWL."
Hypnospace Outlaw,"as for what you could do better next time, I love the scripting, timing and all the editing was solid.

but the gifs and the emojis.

they lack the soul the rest of the video has. im sorry but I cant get it out of my head.



I cant wait to see more!"
Hypnospace Outlaw,"good video, enjoy the ego boost from the glowing comment section lol.


but seriously, this was quality content 👌"
Hypnospace Outlaw,Joey did lespla
Hypnospace Outlaw,"Holy gods this video is underated, like honestly man I have listen to this 4 ish times and I'm still not bored, that's a haul mark of a great YouTuber and a great video. If you make any more content you'll be sure I'll watch it."
Hypnospace Outlaw,"I'll just say again what was already said by others - this review was perfect. It's really apparent that you poured a lot of love and hard work into it, researched the game through and through, and even if the view count is low, those of us who did watch it surely enjoyed it a lot. Keep at it, you're doing amaizing stuff!"
Hypnospace Outlaw,"this video deserves far more views, the end of hypnospace still makes my eyes feel a bit XD"
Hypnospace Outlaw,"fun fact
(spoilers bellow)












you can actually save Zane from the mindcrash by getting him flagged in the first case w/ him and making him get warned
and then when the mindcrash case starts you can go to his ""got game or way lame"" secret page and get him flagged once again and banned, which will get him off the hypnospace and most importantly will leave him alive after the mindcrash!"
Hypnospace Outlaw,I really enjoyed this! You certainly deserve more attention
Hypnospace Outlaw,The level of quality on this video made me assume it had tens of thousands of views - was surprised to see this video/channel hadn’t been spread by the algorithm yet!
Hypnospace Outlaw,BLUE this video was so good and so informative and omg?? I would’ve never thought this game would be so cool?? It was hella confusing at the beginning but I fell in love with it??
Hypnospace Outlaw,hehe funny dream game go zzzz
Hypnospace Outlaw,Best YouTuber <3
Hypnospace Outlaw,"Dear god this video is incredible, and inspires me to make the content I want to see in the world, so thanks! :D"
Hypnospace Outlaw,Amazing Video!
Hypnospace Outlaw,this is the best video ive ever watched im looping it and using it as white noise to fall asleep to
Hypnospace Outlaw,i love you
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,3:52 lol he could’ve ran around the tank.
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,"I am ok with the graphics, but the erratic framerate makes me choose the iOS version over Switch, at least it is a constant 30 fps there. Also on iOS some interactions make more sense, they should have included touchscreen support on Switch as well. Not to mention how short it is, hopefully a sequel will be released someday"
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,Wanna Play it😍 does the CIA take part in it??
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,"Interactive textbook or a bag of chips? I'll go with the chips.

Thanks for letting me know it's not worth my hard earned cash. You saved me $4."
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,Good news Mark. Now on sale for £3.23! Happy gaming!
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,Hi happy new year to you m8 gr8 review.  Just got a new switch 4 Xmas & was thinking 2 pick this up as its €3 on e shop isn it really worth it. Loving my swich really cool console by The big N! Keep up the gr8 channel XD
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,im iranien
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,On sale for $5 right now in the eshop! I think I'll have to pick this one up solely for the story.
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,this reminds me of  the Warriors from ps2 made by Rockstar games
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,Has anybody loved a game that doesn't perform well or have great graphics but you adore it anyway? Madworld & No more heroes for me
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,"Looks good gamely wise and story seems important, like a telltale game. If it's only a few hours I find that argument a bit tough to argue with but why am I okay with spending £16 on a 2 hour (sometimes awful) movie at the cinema that's a one off experience, yet when it comes to a game for the same price that's that short I pause and wait for a sale? Inside,Abzu, walking dead episodes and journey Are games I finished in under 2 hours and found them to be excellent or average. seen way too many poor movies. Just food for thought"
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,SUCH a great idea that i hope more developers go for. i would love to see a rise in historically accurate games. it's a bit of a shame that is suffers from poor graphics and mediocre gameplay.
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,"Thanks for the review, I think I may avoid this game. The graphics themselves just does not do it for me. I'm a fan of retro and modern, though this looks like something in between..."
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,Ya I'm gonna pass on this one. All the people in the street reminds me of liberals when Emperor Trump won election. Thanks for review buddy
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,"meh lame game, good review though"
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,"I always wanted to play this game. I love story based games, so playing one based on events that actually happened sounds like a good idea."
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,too bad. I'll wait for a sale. Though I not that big on adv games...
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,"Good review Mark. It's really too bad they couldn't get performance where it should be. Only 1,452 green jumper men eh? I heard there were at least 1,600 to find ;)"
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,Nice review. The graphics doesn't really bother me reminds me of San Andreas. Either way this game is a wait for deep sale after this review thanks Mark
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,A great Idea probably could have been executed better...
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,"Hi guys - thanks so much for watching this review! I am a massive fan of adventure games - Broken Sword probably being my favourite series. This has a lot of potential, but something doesn't seem quite right. Let me know your favourite adventure, would love to hear what you guys are in to! Seeeeyaaaaaa! (Mark)"
Monument Valley,Best game
Monument Valley,Hi there!! We're so proud to announce you that we just hit more than 500 downloads with our very own Math Tapper! Feel free to download and play our app on iTunes - https://apple.co/2M9KhME and Google Play - http://bit.ly/2ADrNzq
Monument Valley,"This is a great video, good job :)"
Monument Valley,Hell ya it is
Monument Valley,But is it worth the $4
Monument Valley,"I enjoyed this game, but I expected it to be much longer and also more difficult.  The best moments were when you had to connect two paths on different spatial planes by rotating the scene and changing the perspective.  My favorite version of this was in the Totem level, probably.  Moments like those are great and require a flash of insight.  They make you feel clever when you solve them.

Unfortunately, there aren't as many of those moments as you'd think from a game like this.  Most of the game felt either like fairly simple puzzles, or just walking forward without requiring much thought at all.  Many of the puzzles can be solved simply by walking forward until you can't go any farther, toggling the only interactive thing you see, and walking forward again through the newly opened path, and then repeat.  This made it feel less like solving puzzles and more like watching the world unravel, which was often pretty cool to be fair.  It's a lot of fun seeing the levels change as you explore them, even if these changes don't blow your mind or change your perspective as much as you'd like or expect them to.

I would have liked to feel stumped at some point, and to need to rethink the game's version of reality, and approach it with a new paradigm.  To point to an example of what I wanted, Portal or Portal 2 really do make you think about reality in a different way than we're used to.  It COMPLETELY retrains you on how to approach getting from point A to point B.  Monument Valley is similar in that it allows you to bend rules of reality to solve puzzles to get from point A to B.  But you never really need to form a new paradigm/understanding of the game's reality and your interaction with it in order to solve its puzzles.  Usually it's sufficient to just play around a bit, and every now and then something weird goes on with perspective, but you don't really need to plan ahead or think about it too much, since the path is quite linear and there's only really a couple ways you could go.  The puzzles are more for spectacle than for tickling your brain.  Which is still cool, to be fair, but it doesn't reach the heights of Portal.

But what am I saying?  It's totally unfair to ask a phone game to reach the heights of a game like Portal, and it's extremely high praise to compare it to Portal in the first place.  Monument Valley is great.  My favorite level is the one that starts on a small island in a turbulent sea in a rainstorm, where you begin by picking a flower from the top of the island.  Gameplay-wise, it's not the most interesting level.  But conceptually, I think it's the coolest.

I was hoping it would be much longer than it really is--at least five hours would be nice.  I feel like I only dipped my feet into the game.  I imagine it's hard to design these levels, though.  Definitely much more difficult to create a strong level here than in most games.  I haven't tried the paid DLC or Ida's Dream.

I definitely recommend this game, but not for somebody who is looking for a game to play regularly.  This is a short experience, not an arcade-like phone game."
Monument Valley,"its an epic game but very less levels , its better than love you to bits and money waster lumino city"

Monument Valley,"Love the review, you need to review more!!!"
Monument Valley,Loved the game. So beautiful but it's too short
Monument Valley,"Great review! Ive only heard great things, going to pick this one up"
Monument Valley,Do you play mobile games?
Monument Valley,I existed when the first game did
Monument Valley,I used to be TERRIFIED by the black birds in game. I was only seven or eight so but they scared me 😅
Monument Valley,I got momunment valley on my kindle when I was seven because my mom saw it was listed as a “ACUALLY free” game. Ofc I had trouble with it usally asking my dad for help 😂. I remeber plying it years later on a car ride with my friend both the second and first one we completed. Always thought the mother and daughter where sisters until now 😂
Monument Valley,Wtf 1 lakhs+ views and 632 like and 28 comments 😅
Monument Valley,Lovely people!
Monument Valley,"I played these games with my mom when I was little, and it’s still some of my dearest memories with her from my childhood. I think about them every once in a while, and often find myself getting inspired by it"

Monument Valley,The red hood girl is Ida and in MV 1 in the(cementary) level the grave holds the girl's mother- obviously.
Monument Valley,I played the first game years and years ago when it was free on my amazon tablet. I fell in love with it from the start and even though it was hard and took me longer than it should have to beat. I take Pride in playing the game. Fast foward to now and I'm playing the second game for the first time :)
Monument Valley,When I was younger about seven or eight years old my dad let me play Monument Valley on his phone I think I finished it on my own. At dinner today (I'm eleven) my dad asked me if I remember it and said that there was a second one so he put it in our Google play family library and I'm almost done in the span of a few hours. But I need my dad to put the first one into the family library because I wanna re-play it
Monument Valley,If anyone from monument valley is reading this I am completely addicted! I finished one and two in three days so I’m so excited for monument valley 3! I’m asking for monument valley merchandise for Christmas!
Monument Valley,"16th! (Underated Youtuber, new types of content out like real soon lol)"
Monument Valley,super interesting episode and I love this series but man this should be edited better... same as the first one with Cuphead... it's just so quick and frantic sometimes for no reason
Monument Valley,Are there any plans for the third sequel?
Monument Valley,Why there are so many dislikes?
Monument Valley,ىؤ
Monument Valley,Kim Chi <3
Monument Valley,8:09 E.g. Minecraft
Monument Valley,I'll subscribe if you only fill my feed with more good content like this and not hours long videos and highlights I've no interest in watching. I know this is kinda blackmail in a way but think of it as constructive criticism. I really enjoyed this video btw and would love to watch more! I'm just about to watch the other videos in the Levels series!
Monument Valley,The video is really good butI feel as of you should work on the thumbnail. Why? It's because it's the first thing that people see before judging whether you should watch a video or not and yours(I don't mean to offend you when I write this) is very cluttered and doesn't look like the thing that would grab people's attention.
Monument Valley,I’m here to support Rossatron.
Monument Valley,I'm loving this mini docs. Keep 'em coming! :D

BattleBlock Theater,"I hate how completely forgotten this game is nowadays... Even with Castle Crashers, that game is still fairly talked about to this day. But this one pretty much died a few years ago and never came back... Hopefully the Behemoth decides to give it the remastered treatment which will bring it back to life for a bit, because MAN DOES THIS GAME DESERVE MORE RECOGNITION"

BattleBlock Theater,03:23 says it all!
BattleBlock Theater,Thank you for this. I'm a mom with a son and I need these reviews!
BattleBlock Theater,"This game is definitely one of my favorite games of all time, I just love humorous games like Earthbound, Paper Mario: TTYD, and more"
BattleBlock Theater,It deserves at least a 10.1
BattleBlock Theater,"This game is $5 dollars on the XBOX Black Friday 2015 and it plays on XBOX One.

BattleBlock Theater,"got this game fr33 on xbox live during summer 2014 :]
absolutely love it"
BattleBlock Theater,"Merit 9 this title, for me.  And have multiplayer too."
BattleBlock Theater,That last scene before the score was some perfect poetry my friend. I shall not get this game :) lol
BattleBlock Theater,do i need a controller?
BattleBlock Theater,"I'm prioritizing the indie games first before the big-budget games.
Makes me want to make a walkthrough: both completionist and perfectionist."
BattleBlock Theater,"Great game, probably the most fun Behemoth game to date. Especially fun with Multiplayer (single player is not as fun) and the Level Editor is *amazing*.

I must admit though, the levels get pretty repetitive fast and most of the replayablity (for me at least) comes from levels made by other players, rather than the official game's levels. Also the combat system is bad, mostly revolving around mashing buttons, spamming weapons, or jumping on top of your opponents' heads (which is really infuriating when it happens to you). It isn't problematic in Single Player or with just one other player, but gets really frustrating in Online Multiplayer. It feels like a watered down version of Super Smash Bros. combat."
BattleBlock Theater,This is the best game of 2013 along with crysis 3 and state of decay and battlefield 4.
BattleBlock Theater,On xbox one everyone got Guacamelee which is awesome
BattleBlock Theater,Fun game
BattleBlock Theater,Its essentially littlebigplanet meets castle crashers. A fantastic combo. And yes I know behemoth made crashers. Totally worth however much you pay for it.
BattleBlock Theater,I find tis game Better then aaa games like darksouls bf 4 those are just games I hate 
BattleBlock Theater,This game is great. I was just playing with my friends and it was a good time. I love the narrator and writing; it's pretty funny shit.

BattleBlock Theater,"Looking to get this to play with my 7 year old, is the content mostly kid friendly? I assume it is, I'm ok with the poop and fart jokes, thinking more about blood and violence. He plays Castle Crashers with me with Blood turned off, I'm not that strict, just wondering..."
BattleBlock Theater,Bought the 2 pack. omg its fking fun to play with a buddy. We both were laughing our ass off through the entire first chapter

BattleBlock Theater,"Guys with this on sale with 33% off, you think its worth it? Im like 60% sure i wanna buy it but trial games always show you the fun easy levels and get you into the game and then when you buy it you realise its pretty blande and boring, just too hard or not fun. Any help would be appreciated, thanks :)"
BattleBlock Theater,"So what if I was gay, would you have a problem with that?"
BattleBlock Theater,"I find this really funny;

since of all the people I know who still call things gay, they're probably deep in the closet."
BattleBlock Theater,You know it :D
BattleBlock Theater,nice to know a personality like you isnt on xbox live
BattleBlock Theater,Of course they have to make it for gay ass Xbox.
