Wii Sports,So this is the reason we don't have boxing in switch sports...
Wii Sports,Φοβερο παιχνίδι
Wii Sports,"This hard to watch in 2023, this guy’s voice performance is incredibly awkward and dull, and I’m gonna be honest, he doesn’t know how to play Wii Golf."
Wii Sports,Wii sports is the best game on the Wii.
Wii Sports,HI
Wii Sports,"why the hell is the description just ""None"""
Wii Sports,Who be watching this 2021
Wii Sports,Kinect Sports is better.
Wii Sports,2020
Wii Sports,"We all hummed along with the song, don’t lie."
Wii Sports,I came from r/gaming
Wii Sports,I came here after the 5 minutes of early nostalgia video :(
Wii Sports,11/10 great bowling.
Wii Sports,2019 anyone
Wii Sports,better then gta and red dead and fortnut
Wii Sports,Is it just mii who didn’t get wii sports as a freebie with the console
Wii Sports,we all truly loved this game. we needed it *and i want it to become more popular*
Wii Sports,"IGN WTF
Not only is it true
But the trick is to have real competition and a couple beers.
IGN can't out drink me I'm a stinkin drinkin king and I could hama maaaaahhhaaa (INAUDIBLE)

*passes out knockout drunk*"
Wii Sports,So is it an 11/10?
Wii Sports,Anyone from instagram?
Wii Sports,I saw the meme
Wii Sports,Better than Red Dead 2
Wii Sports,Seven years later and in here ign notice me plz
Wii Sports,I like boxing but I really don’t understand it
Wii Sports,Need more views
Wii Sports,Bowling is the best
Wii Sports,F o u l b a l l
Wii Sports,The best tech demo you'll ever play.
Wii Sports,"This guy made a mistake. You ARE able to practice swing in golf. Just swing with the Wiimote without holding down the trigger on the back.

Also, I wouldn't recommend drinking beers before or during play. I'm sure you wouldn't want to throw the Wiimote through your TV screen like in other videos."
Wii Sports,What a jog down memory lane.
Wii Sports,Just 15k view???
Wii Sports,fishy place
Wii Sports,"are you kidding me, I love boxing"
Wii Sports,I think wii sports is one of those games that really shows off what the wii can do. I don't think it is the best game in the world because after a while I'll get bored but it one of the best games I've ever played with my friend and family. Also how many of u can remember the day when u bought a wii and played this before anything else
Wii Sports,Omg I remember this
Wii Sports,IGN u guys do a great job at reviewing games
Wii Sports,Hello
Wii Sports,Nice review
Wii Sports,'We'll never get tired of this game!!!' - back in the noughties
Wii Sports,"I like how Matt explains what 10-pin bowling is, because I'm probably completely out of touch with traditional forms of physical entertainment and cultural artefacts. -Thanks Matt."
Wii Sports,"That's a fair point by Matt, these graphics don't hold up to Gears of War. Neither does Minecraft I suppose. Maybe Gears of War would have sold better if it was a family-friendly collection of small, coherent, arcade-like video games. Food for thought."
Wii Sports,its funny hot this is the best selling video game but 1000 views
Wii Sports,953 views :)) why?
Wii Sports,No comments? The fuck?
Wii Sports,my soul lives in wii sports
Wii Sports,Back in the day. I played Wii Sports so much the disk stopped working
Wii Sports,nostalgic 🥺
Wii Sports,extreme nostalgia
Wii Sports,Can I have an iPhone XR pls
Wii Sports,I had the first generation that was backwards compatible with the GameCube
Wii Sports,Play Wii Sports Resort more games
Wii Sports,Fun game but ultimately replaced by the successor Wii Sports Resort
Wii Sports,They need to make switch sports
Wii Sports,Woooooooooowwwwww brought back memories lol
Wii Sports,Bro I loved Wii sports 🏀 I haven’t played in Years
Wii Sports,*NOSTALIGIA*
Wii Sports,I played this on my Wii mini this morning ahahaha
Wii Sports,i miss playing wii sports .. i would play that with my wife and her friend super fun.. might have to buy another one and get wii sports again
Wii Sports,Just played it yesterday ….. great fun still when you don’t want to go play actual tennis
Wii Sports,First
Wii Sports,You did not say that famous quote: “who do you think you are?? I am??!!” 😂
Wii Sports,I'm gonna need a full cover of Wii sports theme
Wii Sports,Do wii sports resort
Wii Sports,I worked for a senior service agency ten years ago and helped run a Wii bowling league at a nursing home. The residents LOVED it.
Wii Sports,One of my favourite things to do was to just set all the slots in Tennis to empty and just let the miis play. Then do commentary with my friends
Wii Sports,"Great video honoring a great game that I STILL play often. 😉

Too bad Switch Sports is total garbage. 🤮"
Wii Sports,Is that MC Ride on the thumbnail?
Wii Sports,I have to say this even though I'm late af. THE MIIS IN BLOWLING DO NOT JUMP UP BECAUSE YOU THREW THE BALL BACK THERE. I do not understand why tf everyone thinks this. Ever notice how the timing is off and never consistent? Why wouldn't they react perfectly and the same every time you throw the ball back? If anyone in the bowling alley gets a strike they all jump up in celebration. You only ever see them when you throw the ball backwards though so everyone just assumes it has to do with them. My autism cannot handle how wrong everyone is about this lmfao
Wii Sports,Suddenly remembered I threw my arm out playing Tennis one time. It was worth it 🤭
Wii Sports,when the wii came out it felt like miis were gonna be used for everything and then they kind of weren't
Wii Sports,"Winning boxing…..

Oh oh oh oh oh 

Oh oh oh oh oh 

Oh oh oh oh oh"
Wii Sports,My dad ended up losing a bunch of weight boxing against Matt… so I mean… Matt helped my dad 😂
Wii Sports,"I remember my family was only able to get a Wii with it always being sold out via a credit card reward. Also, so Wii Sports Resort when?"
Wii Sports,YOU GUYS MADE FUCKED UP LITTLE GUYS TOO!!? MY SISTERS AND I MADE ANT VERSIONS OF ALL THE MAIN TWILIGHT CHARACTERS!! ANT NAMES AND ALL
Wii Sports,These guys are like the Click and Clack (from car talk)of gaming.
Wii Sports,I'm so glad to see Eddy nine pins play the other games
Wii Sports,I honestly can't remember playing any other Wii game.
Wii Sports,"Im assuming most people don’t know that in the 91 pin game mode, if you ride the ball on the railing all the way down that you hit the red button at the end it knocks down all of the pins. So challenging yet satisfying to do that"
Wii Sports,Eddy nine pins
Wii Sports,Congratulations on getting into the Hall of Fame
Wii Sports,I loved wii baseball and didn't have much problem going pro
Wii Sports,My ring tone is the wii sports theme
Wii Sports,I'm not saying me and my sister were pro gamers but we did pro every sport you could on both our mii's and I had 3 perfect games in the bowling
Wii Sports,I love the miis! I need more miis
Wii Sports,Wii sports? Never heard about this game.
Wii Sports,Wii sports resort hit too
Wii Sports,"pleaseeeee do a video on wii sports resort, that game was literally everything to me!! the sword fighting was top tier"
Wii Sports,“One freak mii everyone had?” That was just straight up my main mii I love making the stupidest character possible XD I still do on the switch too.
Wii Sports,i didn’t bother buying switch sports and it’s all because they don’t have the backwards bowl
Wii Sports,Please do a wii resort one
Wii Sports,"my mom bought us one before we even knew what a wii was, one of my fondest memories. luv my mom"
Wii Sports,11 years ago is when i last touched this (I’m 15) I regret letting my parents throw it out and not fixing it.
Wii Sports,Can someone make 10 hr version of eddy Wii song
Wii Sports,wsg eddy 9 pins
Wii Sports,4:07 holy shit it looks just like him
Wii Sports,"You may not like Wii baseball, I agree.

But take things back to the mid 80's and play Black Box Baseball!!

That, and LJN Baseball are very bad.

Still better than Atari 2600 Baseball. the one made be Atari, not the one that came after.  

The one that was a port of the Intellevision Baseball.  That one was the best, at the time.

Cheers from Canada"
Wii Sports,"You're right.  The Wii does bring families together.


Waaaay more than ""Scene it"" or ""Monopoly""

Those games have led families to crumble, 
world wide."
Wii Sports,nine pins
Wii Sports,I HAD NO IDEA THERE WAS A TRAINING MODE??!????!!?
Wii Sports,"Wow, another great video from Eddy Ninepins and his twin brother."
Wii Sports,"EDDIE 9 PINS LET""S GOOOO"
Wii Sports,One time in boxing I beat my brother so hard he threw from crying💀
Wii Sports,"I played Wii Sports Resort religiously growing up, i loved coming up with more strange ways to crash my plane"
Wii Sports,hey it's eddy 9 pins
Wii Sports,Growing up I had a Wii and I remember playing Wii sports the first time I played the console and at least a couple of times after but at some point I lost the disc and I always wanted to get another one and play it more but I never did and I’m still upset about it bc I would wave enjoyed the shit out of this
Wii Sports,I have a lot of found memories of playing Wii bowling with my Grandma and Mom on holidays or when I would spend the night. Just the three of us going at it. Good times. Every now and then I'll boot up the ol Wii for old times sake.
Wii Sports,Every night is a late night as a gamer 😔
Wii Sports,"I played Wii bowling at lot as a kid. I randomly got pro in it one day, and it made me feel incredible because I didn't even know pro was a thing"
Wii Sports,"Something I would like to add is making a mii of someone, and then the person dying. My dad died about 3 years ago so when I started playing the Wii again for the first time in many years, it was really bittersweet. He played wii the most besides me so he's almost always on my team or on the sidelines watching. No other game has that angle imo"
Wii Sports,I didn’t even know there was a training mode
Wii Sports,How does the Mii look just like Eddy?
Wii Sports,"You guys should review the new one , it’s ass"
Wii Sports,Nintendo switch sports was so disappointing
Wii Sports,"I was such a little OCD freak... I got SO upset when my mom and dad made crazy looking miis! My own was the default and I'd wail whenever they made any with eyes on their foreheads and antennae eyebrows. I'd wake up in the morning to new monstrosities! Looking back on it, they really helped get the stick out of my butt and have a sense of humor, and I am proud to say I now have a fair share of mutated miis. 😂"
Wii Sports,That Yoshida Brothers Rising song was and is such a fucking banger.
Wii Sports,"You need to talk about resort, swordfighting absolutely slaps"
Wii Sports,This is my favorite YouTube channel of all time and I'm a YouTube addict lmao I like it how y'all go back and forth I wish y'all did more videos
Wii Sports,I’ve just been listening to this and not paying attention to the video. Tony’s voice was so so sooooo familiar and I couldn’t place it. I just did. He sounds exactly like Josh from “Stuff you should know”.
Wii Sports,"Did anybody else used to play through the entire bowling mini game just to get one attempt at the 91 pins barrier trick easter egg - where if you throw the ball perfectly along the barrier on the right or left side there's a ticking sound, an explosion and all 91 of the pins fall? I vividly remember hitting that for the first time and having no idea that my life had actually peaked in that moment"
Wii Sports,Sports Resort was better.
Wii Sports,so generous of tony ten pins to sit down and record this video with eddy nine pins!
Wii Sports,The Wii fit and sports directly contradicted the notion that gaming was unhealthy!
Wii Sports,Eddie with a y nine pins
Wii Sports,need the wii sports resort episode
Wii Sports,"Dude i love LOVE this game, and I swear I played 16 hours a day of this and wii sports resort. I loved these games."
Wii Sports,Me who bought a Wii+games for 70$ at a yard sale :/
Wii Sports,The emotional damage of someone picking the round face for your mii
Wii Sports,2:29 BOOOOOOWWWWWLING
Wii Sports,"I gotta disagree on baseball, y’all are… off base 😎"
Wii Sports,I never liked Wee or N...AND I NEVER WILL...THE GRAPHICS AND GAMES ARE UGLY
Wii Sports,I remember thinking the people waiting outside stores to get a wii were NUTS. I was 9.
Wii Sports,Are you guys going to review the switch sports? Curious your opinion on the new version.
Wii Sports,so it's supposed to take multiple days to earn pro in a sport huh
Wii Sports,"God, what did your uncle do? Are you okay?"
Wii Sports,Did they cut out an ad at the end?
Wii Sports,"I didn't get a Wii until 2009, but I still have it and it works like a charm. My whole family LOVED bowling and it was wonderful bonding through hard times and bad memories."
Wii Sports,"headcanon: matt is a retired boxing champion, and elisa (the person you usually fight before matt) was the actual champion 

matt fought you just to see if you were a true champion"
Wii Sports,I kinda want to use eddy's singing as my ringtone
Wii Sports,"bah I mastered bowling with Mother...found the sweet spot between pin 1 and 2 if your lefty, 1 and 3 if your righty. get the ball dow the front lineand its strike everytime.......  oh great hint, keep the face of the controller FLAT to roll ball straight... if you twist it during the throw it spins the ball.."
Wii Sports,Bro i miss training mode way more than i thought i would
Wii Sports,The pawnshop I bought mine at was so dumb they thought it was a dvd player and sold it for 40 dollars!
Wii Sports,the christmas of the wii was the best christmas ever.
Wii Sports,Thank you for the nostalgia and for educating the youths on the magic of this console
Wii Sports,bro my grandma has a wii
Wii Sports,wii sports resort was slept on
Wii Sports,"forgive me


DOWN!


🎶 Golf 🎶"
Wii Sports,"As a kid who got in a lot of fights in school, boxing was the best game to me. I remember one summer staying at a cousins house the whole summer and we’d binge Rock band, left for dead, and wii sports. But I would play boxing alone for the most part and everyone would ignore it. But I was pro, and they made fun of me because it was all computer characters. They’d fight me and just spam super fast and knock me out once and look at me like the Miis do. Like “ha you thought you were dope” and then I would completely decimate. Not getting hit a single time and needing that shot and then they would call me lame. But guess what bitch, I’m not the one getting pissed because someone better at a game we both played non stop for three months. Now we all love each other (sike)"
Wii Sports,My peak physical and mental health is when I had Wii sports and Wii fit hands down.
Wii Sports,Nice one Eddie Nine Pins
Wii Sports,"After hearing you sing that smash hit Wii Sports song, I had to subscribe 🤣🤣🤣😌"
Wii Sports,Yo did Eddy ever make a statement about Established Titles? There was an ad read for them on this video but it looks like he pulled it.
Wii Sports,They did not have to go that hard with the training compilation with ave Maria in the background
Wii Sports,Man I’m glad eddy 9pins made another video about wii sports
Wii Sports,Eddy 9 pins
Wii Sports,Yeah.... So wii sports resort really is the peak. Switch sports barely scrapes past the first game.
Wii Sports,Eddy 9 Pin
Wii Sports,Why would I take advice on bowling from eddy 9 pins?
Wii Sports,i can’t even describe the instant rush of joy i got when the wii sports theme chimed in. i was dancing in my seat
Wii Sports,YES PLS make a wii sports resort video that game will forever be more iconic to me it's so fun
Wii Sports,Hot take: kinect sports was better
Wii Sports,Badminton❌️ Badmin✅️
Wii Sports,is Nintendo going to fix motion problem or what?
Wii Sports,Still better on the original Wii
Wii Sports,No golf?!?😢
Wii Sports,No boxing!?
Wii Sports,Such a missed chance they didn't include the terrific golf from Wii Sports
Wii Sports,"If you could only buy this or Mario Tennis, which would you get? Obviously this has more games, but presumably the tennis gameplay is a lot better on Mario."
Wii Sports,Damn no baseball
Wii Sports,Kinect Sports was better
Wii Sports,"he said he ""waited till the menu music ended? to move on""
.....we could tell the quality of this review, thanks."
Wii Sports,Does this need any separate hardware  purchase other than game card ? Does normal joycon works ?
Wii Sports,Wii Sports Resort is destroying this
Wii Sports,"More switch garbage ouff. Why are there missed opportunities, jesus they have all the resources to make a mega awesome game and release this stuff"
Wii Sports,The old style was 100% better
Wii Sports,You have 12 friends? Unlikely story.
Wii Sports,Very helpful review
Wii Sports,Sword figthing was my favorite on wii sports
Wii Sports,Osososos
Wii Sports,"As if it doesnt have golf, boxing or baseball??"
Wii Sports,Evryone talking about baseball and boxing but where is golf 😩
Wii Sports,Should have guessed before watching this video ign would give classic 7
Wii Sports,No ⚾️
Wii Sports,i’m so upset they don’t have baseball or any of the games from wii sport resort… disappointed
Wii Sports,12 friends?! Must be nice
Wii Sports,Basketball 🏀
Wii Sports,"Bowling is the best / most fun sport hands down to play!! But everything else is fun for 5 - 10 minutes. Nintendo really screwed up, especially with badminton, soccer, and whatever the hell "" chambara "" is...They really should have just gave us boxing and  baseball back. Hopefully golf is worth the wait."
Wii Sports,what happen to the bike game
Wii Sports,But it isn't set on Wuhu island I'm taking
Wii Sports,What about boxing and baseball those will be missed
Wii Sports,No baseball and boxing is sad 😢
Wii Sports,"If they just remade the original Wii sports but with online play, it would of been far more popular."
Wii Sports,Golf is being added at a later date as a free download
Wii Sports,A lazy cash grab.
Wii Sports,Review the controls
Wii Sports,Great review
Wii Sports,"For anybody who is interested in the party style of games, try out ""Mario and Sonic at the Oympic Games"". It has a much better variety."
Wii Sports,WHERES THE MIIS?!
Wii Sports,I'm starting to see the trend with Nintendo's modern games. The lack of content compared to their older titles!
Wii Sports,Downgrade
Wii Sports,"We need the get the skydiving, archery, wakeboarding, and frisbee back!"
Wii Sports,IGN again proving why they are the worst :)
Wii Sports,imagine if Nintendo didn't make the dlc's free
Wii Sports,At least he got to spend time and play with his parents
Wii Sports,"L
O
L"
Wii Sports,Still waiting for 1-2 Switch 2!
Wii Sports,The game is not 7/10 it's 9/10
Wii Sports,Wii sports music reference lol
Wii Sports,No boxing? Disappointed
Wii Sports,Imagine the chaos in the living room if a party of parents would be playing Switch Sports.
Wii Sports,No local multiplayer without the dock ruins this game
Wii Sports,I’m so sad the plane flying isn’t on there 😭😭😭😭
Wii Sports,why have doubles tennis 🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃
Wii Sports,No baseball 😱
Wii Sports,"no boxing '?>
best part sport game"
Wii Sports,"Badminton is my favorite, having a blast online trying to rank up 😁"
Wii Sports,"Lol, sports resort came out way later than sports...."
Wii Sports,$50 for half of the game. Typical for the gaming industry. That's I wait till it goes on sale or simply don't buy it. Then they will drop the price. Trust the process.
Wii Sports,"My dad and little brother both destroyed me at bowling, with my brother getting a 192 on his first go"
Wii Sports,They missed out golf
Wii Sports,This was always a great party game!
Wii Sports,What's with the lack of games?
Wii Sports,Where’s the boxing 🥊?
Wii Sports,"Meh, I'll get Mario Tennis, Strikers orGolf instead. This is not the sports game for me."
Wii Sports,"if it ain't broke, don't fix it. unfortunately it looks like nintendo tried too hard to fix it."
Wii Sports,Wtf do u mean 15 years ago?!!!
Wii Sports,Is Golf gonna be a Free?
Wii Sports,"Ill wait for Golf to come out, hopefully its a free DLC and it has a solid course selection."
Wii Sports,The lack of archery is for me the biggest flaw in this package - I'd have liked to see the game utilise the ring-con to emulate drawing back the bow string as an option.
Wii Sports,"Baseball and boxing were my favorite sports in the original, needless to say not excited by this edition"
Wii Sports,Cool
Wii Sports,4/10 for me soccer and volleyball hard carried
Wii Sports,No mention of unlocks or online 🫤
Wii Sports,"Didn’t need to flex on us with the 12 friends, we can’t all be popular like you"
Wii Sports,BOXING WOULD BE SO PERFECT
Wii Sports,12 friends. Who has 12 friends....
Wii Sports,The most unbelievable part here is when you say you got a group of 12 people together.
Wii Sports,"Contrary to your opinion, I've enjoyed the Football mode the most! It really feels the most tactical because of the importance of positioning, passing to teammates at the right time and aiming the ball correctly."
Wii Sports,It went from a novelty party game to nostalgia freak gamers playing a competitive minigame collection AND ITS GREAT
Wii Sports,"It's pretty disillusioning that they put both Tennis AND Badminton in here, when they only have 6 sports total. It's kind of a wasted slot that could have been used for sports with more variety."
Wii Sports,"Im callin 7
Edit: lets gooo"
Wii Sports,Bad game
Wii Sports,"This review is not great, every sport is personal preference and soccer is easily my favorite one of the bunch"
Wii Sports,"Omfg Nitendo, just remake wii sports resort"
Wii Sports,"Nice game, but feel lacking. The games have less than the Wii varients. We had twelve games cut down to six... and the only real improvements seem to be bowling and soccer... one with an expansion for extra stuff. Soccer being a new game with old problems. 

The second problem is the odd lack of equipment to make for Mii stand out... yes you can 'grind' and randomly pull a new piece out, but not a lot of these games will last long enough for it.

Mostly miss Archery, and some of the other interesting sports."
Wii Sports,How do you have 12 friends wtf
Wii Sports,It's a shame that everyone is so focused on the fact that miis aren't quite in the game.
Wii Sports,The should've added baseball
Wii Sports,"Correction: Golf will arrive as a free update, not DLC"
Wii Sports,"Quick question:

Do you HAVE to use motion controls for this game or can you just use the joycon or a controller?"
Wii Sports,What about boxing? Baseball?
Wii Sports,I’d prefer the og wii sports
Wii Sports,It feels like a cashgrab from nintendo tbh
Wii Sports,Controls might be hard on the switch lite.
Wii Sports,I’m just super disappointed they cut boxing :( that was my entire cardio as a kid.
Wii Sports,the only thing it lacks is no more sports
Wii Sports,seriously how is golf NOT in the game?
Wii Sports,No golf makes this game a no go for me…
Wii Sports,"Dude, just cause you aint ""A rank"" pro on soccer dosen't mean its the most disappointing. It takes a lot of team work and strategy to score that goal yo!!!"
Wii Sports,"So just to get this clear there’s no base ball, basket ball, and boxing?  You’re charging $40 for 6 games when the original had more options and was free. And literally 3 of the 6 games are similar."
Wii Sports,"Might have missed it, but does this game have an online multiplayer feature?"
Wii Sports,my favorite game ever
Wii Sports,"13 years later we know, that this is one of the greatest Wii games ever made."
Wii Sports,"The fact that Wii was so advance in its time 
It's crazy to imagine"
Wii Sports,Why does t the switch game have nearly this much content. SAD.
Wii Sports,"""Apply English to the ball."" XD"
Wii Sports,-“#”#
Wii Sports,Oh lord the nostalgia
Wii Sports,ButtPaste300
Wii Sports,Lol wii sports resort was packaged with my wii
Wii Sports,IGN is satan
Wii Sports,this is the greatest nostalgic game ever.
Wii Sports,Looking back this game is seriously underrated...
Wii Sports,2021 anyone?
Wii Sports,You CANNOT call this a 'tech demo'.
Wii Sports,"Swordplay- Insanely intuitive and challenging!
Wakeboarding- Satisfying seeing your points rack up!
Frisbee- Incredible precision possible, and nice to try and get a high score!
Archery- Incredible precision with the Wii Motion Plus, and the hidden fruits are super cool!
Basketball- Incredibly addictive and super fun with friends!
Table Tennis- Awesome controls and depth. So much replay value!
Golf- The insane amount of complexity and strategy possible!
Bowling- Many different modes with each having a different feel! So much fun with friends, and trying to get a better score!
Power Cruising- High speed fun with cool stages and visuals!
Canoeing- Intense, and addictive! Awesome VS mode!
Cycling- Nail-biting, and a lot of variety in the course layout!
Air Sports- Island Flyover is super relaxing and fun! So awesome to explore Wuhu Island!

I love this game to death. 10/10 for sure! It deserves a better score. Here's to Wii Sports Resort!"
Wii Sports,Who’s watching this 2020? Btw I remember playing this as a kid....Time flies so fast...
Wii Sports,A lot of nostalgia from this game. Especially the music
Wii Sports,Buying a Wii again this week just to play this game with my wife. I loved the original Wii Sports back in the day but never played this.
Wii Sports,"11/10 ""it has a little something for everyone"""

Wii Sports,How to get this game

Wii Sports,I got an ign advert on an ign video lol
Wii Sports,"If only it had online multiplayer, with families being able to play against each other from around the world."
Wii Sports,eh..I bought the game yesterday and it isn't too entertaining...whatever...
Wii Sports,anyone 2021?
Wii Sports,7.7???? IS THAT IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SERIOUSLY IGN???? What is is with your old scoring system??
Wii Sports,"""We look forward to seeing how other games use the Wii MotionPlus""

(well, there was Wii Play Motion which was good, but other than that it was just Skyward Sword and that was awful)"
Wii Sports,"I have this games in my wii,i can play tennis very well my record is 247"
Wii Sports,"I have this games in my wii,i can play tennis very well my record is 247"
Wii Sports,"You know, in my opinion, this game deserves a 10."
Wii Sports,who remembers the zombie game
Wii Sports,this deserved a higher rating
Wii Sports,Only 7.7?
Wii Sports,I seriously think this is one of the best games of all time
Wii Sports,Definitely a true Wii classic game.. swordplay is actually pretty awesome :D
Wii Sports,Nice
Wii Sports,Cycling is actually my favourite game- that and table tennis
Wii Sports,was this dude playing a video game or taking a math test?
Wii Sports,WTF? Cycling in this game is awsome!
Wii Sports,Wii sport resort There's sports that don't feel like sports
Wii Sports,this looks like so much fun 
Wii Sports,The only people who dislike the wii are people who are too lazy to pick up the remote and move about

Super Mario Bros.,6:35 nintendo will roll out one these every 12 months lol ok dude major cap
Super Mario Bros.,They should launch one with POKÉMON games!!!
Super Mario Bros.,Yo make dat starfox one tho
Super Mario Bros.,Where would the gaming market be if some dude didn't get bored with his calculator
Super Mario Bros.,It is a great system but a little overpriced for only having two games. The Zelda one is far better and much more worth the price
Super Mario Bros.,"Me playing Zelda game and watch:
Psych"
Super Mario Bros.,Nice video! Anyone knows how to set the time on these things? What does the ACL button do?
Super Mario Bros.,Where can we get a mickey mouse and popeye??
Super Mario Bros.,how the hell did they not put SM3 on this thing?  What a waste
Super Mario Bros.,Got my first star on the Lost Levels and unlocked the world select by pressing b and I've also finished the Super Mario Bros and unlocked the level select and hard mode there. On my second playthrough of the Lost Levels now to unlock world 9. Then it's only six or eight more stars for worlds A to D 🙂
Super Mario Bros.,"A screen that's not the same resolution as NES games? LOL at that. I don't like LCD screens but the one thing they have going for them is that they produce a very sharp picture, but only when displaying video at its native resolution or an exact multiple thereof. I can't stand the ""soft"" (as you called it) look of scaled video on an LCD. It also means they were too cheap to have LCD screens custom manufactured, and instead went with off-the-shelf ones.

A propriety non-replaceable battery is a load of BS too, as is the lack of a headphone jack and not being able to add your own NES ROMs."
Super Mario Bros.,"I just picked up the zelda version. Only played breath of the wild, but this little device is still wicked. It will easily pass the time in any scenario, and I personally love it."
Super Mario Bros.,I can’t be the only one who didn’t know the watch in “game and watch” literally meant a clock.  I figured it had like.. stuff to watch on it
Super Mario Bros.,I would definitely get this if they made it serve as a powerbank too.
Super Mario Bros.,"I had Russian clone of Nintendo Game and watch, it was big deal to get it there"
Super Mario Bros.,There's two variations released the Japan and the US variation. Any differences between the two? And which one is the best? Thanks!
Super Mario Bros.,"I was about to buy this,,, then I remembered I have a Switch... and then I still want it."
Super Mario Bros.,I think the zelda one is a much better deal since it has 4 games that are much bigger than the mario games
Super Mario Bros.,It has been improved.. last time i played game & watch was on 1981.. the game was painted on the screen.
Super Mario Bros.,Hold a for 5 seconds on the clock
Super Mario Bros.,Harga satuannya berapa bagaimana cara membeli.Game watch Mario bross?
Super Mario Bros.,But WTF is Game And Watch?
Super Mario Bros.,"""if you have the screen and volume at max, you should expect shorter battery life""

no fucking shit. i want to how much less?"
Super Mario Bros.,"I still have a stack of my old Game & Watch games. If someone had given me this Game & Watch back in the day, it would've blown my mind lol. Man.. how time flies."
Super Mario Bros.,The only sad part of it is that you can't save and have to start over always
Super Mario Bros.,"The battery sux, the only way these retro games survived is because you could put your own batteries in n out. A chargeable battery wont last 10 years…"
Super Mario Bros.,Where can i buy the nintendo game and watch AMBULANCE game.i am from south africa.
Super Mario Bros.,the couldn't include super mario 3? :(
Super Mario Bros.,"""Why did Nintendo put so few games on here?""

*laughs in Nintendo fan being left out for decades*"
Super Mario Bros.,Imagine a Pokémon one
Super Mario Bros.,Brothers
Super Mario Bros.,My criticism is it should have Mario 1 2 and 3
Super Mario Bros.,I was just searching for a cheaper game console that has pokemon an hour ago. I wanted to play with my sister's Switch and it'snow with my nephews. I thought I could buy a cheap decoy so I can have the Switch. Now I'm thinking I might just buy this for myself
Super Mario Bros.,I feel like Nintendo is young. Because my mom is 3 years older than Nintendo XD
Super Mario Bros.,I have Donkey Kong Jr.
Super Mario Bros.,Does anyone know if the watch could stay on constantly if plugged in? is that safe?
Super Mario Bros.,2 expensive for a free game in a retro console
Super Mario Bros.,Ive watch this 100
Super Mario Bros.,"Ive bought it 5,000   but i love m-luigi"
Super Mario Bros.,They should have released with all ROMs.
Super Mario Bros.,"My question, can you bring it
Inside a plane?"
Super Mario Bros.,"I didn't get this right when it came out because I didn't think it was 'worth it'. Then, people started hacking them, which, doubles my interest in any 'mini' or 'classic' type console, I want to be able to choose the games I add :) After buying it, the prices went WAY up, and I might just keep this one stock because of how nice of a collectible it is. I'll grab a used one later to hack, but even the way it is, it's totally 'worth it' if you're either a Nintendo fan, a Game and Watch fan, or if you just want an easy way to reply Mario again. The only thing I would have liked to have seen is the kick-stand like the classic units have.

I really hope they come out with a Donkey Kong version, or a dual-screen version with games like Oil Panic."
Super Mario Bros.,Walmart still has the Mario game and watch in the store. 2021 Had to get one and Zelda. 😎
Super Mario Bros.,"Wow, nintendo has no shame at this point, 50 bucks and you get three games..."
Super Mario Bros.,My friend selled it to me for $6 dollars 😂
Super Mario Bros.,They should have added Super Mario Land on there...it would have been icing on the cake 🙂
Super Mario Bros.,The no save is putting me off buying this.
Super Mario Bros.,Just ordered mine. So pumped to hear it has metal on the case!!!
Super Mario Bros.,I remember seeing the original in a k-mart
Super Mario Bros.,They should release a collection of all game and watch games instead of this shit
Super Mario Bros.,"I got two, one to play and one to keep in the box and sell"
Super Mario Bros.,the screen is too small compared to a real game & watch
Super Mario Bros.,"Nice, fair review. The Game&Watch devices were wonderful!

30$ would be a fair price for this."
Super Mario Bros.,"Because minimalism, you spoiled child."
Super Mario Bros.,For you young kids that weren't around in 1985 as a ten-year-old I did not even know super Mario Brothers exist it until 1988 and then only the rich kids and the kids that had fathers that were overcompensating for their absence owned 1 it wasn't until 1989 the Christmas of 1989 when me and all of my friends got the NES for the first time I only knew one person who had one in 1988 and it's because his father and mother got a divorce so is absent father bought him one
Super Mario Bros.,5:10 that Superfamicom box so delicous
Super Mario Bros.,Why is nobody talking about this small but awesome surprise feature? Nintendo’s ZELDA Game & Watch SURPRISE REVEALED https://youtu.be/yMrU1s2r9nM
Super Mario Bros.,I just got mine for my birthday and I’m so happy with it!
Super Mario Bros.,ONE YEAR LATER wow everything he said at the end came true  they have made a zelda one and it does have more content than the mario  bros one
Super Mario Bros.,S
Super Mario Bros.,"Oh yes, the next one is Zelda!"
Super Mario Bros.,"There should have been more Game and Watch releases or at least a Game and Watch with more titles on it. They should have released one that had all the original 1985/86 black box NES titles on it that used the traditional NES controller (Donkey Kong, Donkey Kong Jr, Donkey Kong 3, Donkey Kong Jr Math, Mario Bros, Super Mario Bros, Wrecking Crew, Baloon Fight, Clu Clu Land, Golf, etc)."
Super Mario Bros.,I got this for my birthday without realizing it was limited XD
Super Mario Bros.,If only they add (mario 3) it would be the best relic ever!
Super Mario Bros.,"if it works as a clock, why put it to sleep after leaving it unintended for a couple minutes"
Super Mario Bros.,Should've added bluetooth or even an analog headphone jack to justify the $50 price
Super Mario Bros.,I want Zelda
Super Mario Bros.,"I got mine for my birthday last week. I recently got the score of over 1, 000 000 on Super Mario Bros Lost Level (SMB2) playing Mario in infinity lives."
Super Mario Bros.,Can i save the game and resume where i stop?
Super Mario Bros.,"I bought this the day of release, and I'm getting the Zelda one too!"
Super Mario Bros.,I guess its time to get stabbed in the alley trying to get one from a sketchy website
Super Mario Bros.,"Say you die in the game, do you have to restart from the very beginning?"
Super Mario Bros.,Why didnt they put all 3 marios? They are puttin 3 zeldas on the new one boooo
Super Mario Bros.,"Naw super Mario bros 2 is cool for this system bc like u said we aren’t familiar with it, so ppl get a chance to play a new Mario game, the only other way I’ve played that game is super Mario allstars but it’s not even in the original style so imo I think it’s kinda cool, only is Mario 3 was on this thing"
Super Mario Bros.,"Actually just saw a pre owned version of this at my local gamestop, hopefully i can pick it up soon before anyone else"
Super Mario Bros.,No kickstand is dogshit
Super Mario Bros.,It's Super Mario Brothers.
Super Mario Bros.,I don’t play Mario games
Super Mario Bros.,"Where's Super Mario Bros. 3?
Transfer Nes Classic save file games to Game & Watch or Nintendo Switch could be fun.  hope for update"
Super Mario Bros.,How many games is have this mini console?
Super Mario Bros.,This thing cost like 5 dollars to make and chumps paying 80 box for it 😆😆😆😆
Super Mario Bros.,"Sooooo they just announced the Zelda version, looks much better with 4 games included"
Super Mario Bros.,"Someone tall me the secrets, I’m getting one but it’s gonna stay in its box forever"
Super Mario Bros.,Just bought it brand new for 35 euros
Super Mario Bros.,wow they nailed the zelda thing
Super Mario Bros.,I got one to
Super Mario Bros.,Why is it called game and watch
Super Mario Bros.,These will be on ebay for mega money one day
Super Mario Bros.,SML2 would've been a nice inclusion if they wanna stick to NES and GB games.
Super Mario Bros.,Are there checkpoints? Or do I need to start again when It’s game over?
Super Mario Bros.,I'd say it's worth the price. I got mine not to long ago and play it all the time. Can't wait to get the Zelda version.
Super Mario Bros.,What I want to know is if it’s durable like the rubber buttons
Super Mario Bros.,"6:34 They did make another game and watch, but this time it's the legend of zelda."
Super Mario Bros.,Nintendo: we added super Mario bros and the lost levels. And everyone’s favorite... BALL!!!
Super Mario Bros.,Wish it had tetris
Super Mario Bros.,A pokémon version would be so cool for this
Super Mario Bros.,Is there a save game feature on it?
Super Mario Bros.,Who would buy this
Super Mario Bros.,"I was pumped for this as a novelty item until I heard the price point.
What is wrong with these sick fucks?
Sure their audience is full of brainwashed nostalgia blind idiots that will buy this and then realize that the original Super Mario Bros isn't even fun to play in modern times except maybe the first two levels, but I'm surprised to see ANY games journalist be able to be nothing but cynical about this piece of shit and tell people to stay far away from it. I payed $200 for a New 3ds XL and I can play every single NES, SNES, N64, GBA (including Game and Watch Gallery!), DS, and 3DS game freely and easily thanks to the homebrew community, and anyone who would honestly buy this for their portable Super Mario Bros + Lost Levels experience is a damned fool."
Super Mario Bros.,"Ahh, we love mr. video"
Super Mario Bros.,"This was great when I was younger, and it seems just as nice now."
Super Mario Bros.,"""Star Fox is coming to the Wii U"" being cited as a positive thing... didn't quite age the best, suffice to say."
Super Mario Bros.,I hav ethe Super Mario Bros : Game & Watch
Super Mario Bros.,Wow 85 comments :)
Super Mario Bros.,I wonder what the devs were thinking when making the story and then having you break bricks. Did they want to make Mario a murderer?
Super Mario Bros.,cool Sgt. Pepper Poster
Super Mario Bros.,Dude really stole this entire review from SomecallmeJohnny lmfao
Super Mario Bros.,Gotta hype myself for that new mario so nostalgia time
Super Mario Bros.,5:35 The bricks that contained items were Toads! !! !!!
Super Mario Bros.,Over 30 years later and this game is still so fun to play
Super Mario Bros.,"*DEEP BREATH* HAPPY 2015 YA'LL!!! 




so much time has pasta"
Super Mario Bros.,Great review super Mario bros is my favorite game ever
Super Mario Bros.,"1:39

Well, guess who's baaaaaaack?
Bubsy

Oh, and also Crash"
Super Mario Bros.,This game is actually really easy too those stupid hardcore minecraft fnaf and cod players who thinks the new mario games are for baby's who know who i'm talking about a channel who is confirmed a troll and had his channel terminated if you want a really difficult mario game play super mario bros 3 or suffer yourself playing unfair mario
Super Mario Bros.,8:11 only in The Lost Levels.
Super Mario Bros.,"I am so glad you knew about the continued code, because it seems like *nobody* knows about it nowadays."
Super Mario Bros.,"Real talk, who came back here after Marc's video on Super Mario Bros on ice!?"
Super Mario Bros.,Have you ever addressed your plagiarism on this video?
Super Mario Bros.,*watches review of smb* *gets a mario kart 8 deluxe ad*
Super Mario Bros.,Iplay twomgwiipasmgoiusa 😉😇🙃😊😊😡💩💤
Super Mario Bros.,"I played the super mario all star version of this games,but I still like the nes version better."
Super Mario Bros.,"The current DK isn't Jr, he's Jr's son and Cranky's grandson."
Super Mario Bros.,Really like that drawing of u.
Super Mario Bros.,No he kills toads
Super Mario Bros.,"Fun Fact:The Over world theme has Lyrics to it and shown in the Super Mario Bros Super Show!
I recommend you check it out Marc and To every one else who is intrested."
Super Mario Bros.,"Interesting, most if the jokes were stolen straight from SomeCallMeJohnny. Especially the joke about the fire flower being able to almost kill everything. Hell, most of the game clips were used straight from Johnny's review."
Super Mario Bros.,I like how they ret-conned it to New Donk City
Super Mario Bros.,"Serousisly people Mario isn't a murderer if you litarly turn the page it states that when Mario (and Luigi) breaks a brick he frees a toad and they rerord him by giving him the mushroom, fire flower, starman, coins and just plain points (making peach not the only one to be able to revert the curse, Mario and luigi can too but not in one whole go, only peach can snap her fingers android the intire population is saved but if you go bye the tv show peach can't reverse the curse without the magic want that did it so she and the Mario brothers head off to find the wand) ( also the anime movie mad in 1986 got this right cause when they got a power up a toad or abunch of toads are freed)"
Super Mario Bros.,I always thought the original bowser art looked like a shark.
Super Mario Bros.,Level design? Aged well? I don't think so !
Super Mario Bros.,korean at 4:15 !!!!!!!!!!+!+
Super Mario Bros.,he changed his name to Marc Lovalo!?
Super Mario Bros.,I am sure
Super Mario Bros.,how do you do the Mario slide glitch
Super Mario Bros.,"Marc: Happy new year! At last its—
Me: 2017!

Me: .-."
Super Mario Bros.,"Wow. Ironically, I'm watching this on January 1, 2017"
Super Mario Bros.,"You have such a great channel, honestly never heard of it until tonight but I'm subbed now."
Super Mario Bros.,"I really don't like how you use footage from other youtubers...

Super Mario Bros.,AND A SUPER GAMING BROTHERS FAN! AWESOME! We should hang out sometime
Super Mario Bros.,"Eddsworld and Beatles fan, awesome"
Super Mario Bros.,i have just found this channel and i love your content and as a fellow youtuber i hope you become very popular in the future
Super Mario Bros.,f*** your SM3DW Review
Super Mario Bros.,great YouTuber! I'm subbed and NO DISLIKES
Super Mario Bros.,First to dislike ;)
Super Mario Bros.,why are people saying mario is a monster when when he breaks bricks? luigi does the same! who even cares about toads anyway?
Super Mario Bros.,6:07 You also watch SCMJ? I do too! :D
Super Mario Bros.,+SuperSmash3DS dude you definitely deserve more subs because of the quality and the scripting
Super Mario Bros.,Mario sucks  cod and madden are better
Super Mario Bros.,"""Before we had Wii Sports, Tetris, and Minecraft."" And before we had StarCraft. And before we had the Sims. And before we had Myst. But yes, once it was the bestselling video game in history. xD"
Super Mario Bros.,Ahh this game is such a memory for me.
Super Mario Bros.,Dead
Super Mario Bros.,Great review
Super Mario Bros.,"Good stuff man, you definitely summed up what makes this game so enjoyable to this day. :D Looking forward to the next review!"
Super Mario Bros.,This was a surprisingly good first review. Can't wait to see the next one. And good luck with Mario lost levels. 
Super Mario Bros.,<3333
Super Mario Bros.,"Really good video my dude, promising start to your reviews!"
Super Mario Bros.,You forgot lava and water
Super Mario Bros.,"its not 32kb, its actually 41kb"
Super Mario Bros.,"Wasn't it 40kb?
Well but 8kb for grafix"
Super Mario Bros.,I knew about the bushes and the clouds.
Super Mario Bros.,I know
Super Mario Bros.,The clouds have butts
Super Mario Bros.,And Goombas were the mushrooms just remodeled
Super Mario Bros.,Bro didn't blow the cartridge and it worked?!
Super Mario Bros.,"If you guys didnt know, a nes cart only has 40 kb storage"
Super Mario Bros.,I have an old nintendo can you see if it works or not
Super Mario Bros.,the game is 40 KB not 32
Super Mario Bros.,"I knew about 2/3 of these, the third one I didn’t know until now! 😬😬😬"
Super Mario Bros.,Wait the nes can hold 100kb
Super Mario Bros.,And it’s still a fire game
Super Mario Bros.,and 40% of music is 1-1 or 1up theme
Super Mario Bros.,Makes sense why bowser shows up about 10000000 times now.
Super Mario Bros.,Just say bros jesus
Super Mario Bros.,Love the content you are like my favorite retro YouTuber
Super Mario Bros.,also every character has 3 colors
Super Mario Bros.,And Luigi is using the Koopa troopa texture
Super Mario Bros.,And Luigi’s palette is the same as the koopa troopas
Super Mario Bros.,Only 32
Super Mario Bros.,Yes. 😅
Super Mario Bros.,This is a common knowledge for nintendo fans isn't it?
Super Mario Bros.,Same with the goombas and the super mushrooms.
Super Mario Bros.,Game uses same boss everytime
Super Mario Bros.,Cool information
Super Mario Bros.,yes
Super Mario Bros.,The Luigi thing isn’t from Super Mario Bros on the NES it was from Mario Bros in arcades. They used the same green from a Koopa Troopa.
Super Mario Bros.,I knew all o' it exept da' first dev and and 32kb thing 😮
Super Mario Bros.,Fun fact: a screenshot from super Mario bros is around 13x the size of the whole game :0
Super Mario Bros.,It's so weird how much more the NES could pump out graphically in 1990 than in 1985.
Super Mario Bros.,the average screenshot takes up more storage than super mario bros
Super Mario Bros.,I have that game and it comes with duck hunt
Super Mario Bros.,Wow never knew the most obvious mario fact that luigi Is green mario
Super Mario Bros.,"32 kb and they needed to save space ..
🥲"
Super Mario Bros.,The power up sound effect is literally just a sped up version of the tune that plays when you pull down the flag at the end of each level
Super Mario Bros.,"""Actually The Game Is 40kb"" - 🤓"
Super Mario Bros.,"Yes, I know about it. I did not know about the cloud bad there’s no about the Luigi and Mario color swap."
Super Mario Bros.,DON'T PUSH THE CARTRIDGES DOWN YOU IDIOT IT'S BAD FOR THE GAME
Super Mario Bros.,This is why sonic the hedgehog did it better.
Super Mario Bros.,They changed the mushrooms sprite into a goompa
Super Mario Bros.,...this is obvious honestly when you think about it...especially the Mario and Luigi one
Super Mario Bros.,and some audio is the same too like the miss melody just being apart of the main ground theme and the powerup sound just being the flagpole slide slowed and looped
Super Mario Bros.,I feel ripped off
Super Mario Bros.,It’s 41 KB not 32
Super Mario Bros.,"""Hey guys, did you know that Super Mario Bros. Is a game on the NES?""
☠️"
Super Mario Bros.,I don’t know that you help my for know that
Super Mario Bros.,Mario 3 :
Super Mario Bros.,It takes 7 times the amount of Nintendo cartridges to make ONE full hd photo with your phone.
Super Mario Bros.,Uea even the peach song got effected
Super Mario Bros.,How do you open that I cannot open mine
Super Mario Bros.,This is why ur the best gamer youtuber u tell us new tricks and new things every day
Super Mario Bros.,32 KB on this big*ss cartridge? No way.
Super Mario Bros.,I love your videos please don’t stop posting
Super Mario Bros.,Please do not stop posting you’re the best I love your videos they’re really funny😊
Super Mario Bros.,Okay
Super Mario Bros.,Same thing for goombas. But I can’t wait to see your reaction to the end stage music & power up sfx being the same.
Super Mario Bros.,"Correction: 41 kb
nice vid tho"
Super Mario Bros.,😊
Super Mario Bros.,Could even get HD graphics smh Nintendo
Super Mario Bros.,We never cared because we had fun.😁
Super Mario Bros.,this ruined the game forever 😭
Super Mario Bros.,.sorB Oiram repuS
Super Mario Bros.,Soupah mahrioh bruthas.
Super Mario Bros.,Yes I did actually.
Super Mario Bros.,Yes I did
Super Mario Bros.,Love how a picture of the game takes more storage than the game itself
Super Mario Bros.,Ya they use the same sprit with a different color palette
Super Mario Bros.,I did know that actually
Super Mario Bros.,They even make the ground of the level always flat. There is always ground if its not conflicting with anything else.
Super Mario Bros.,"Yes and they made the default block for a certain y coordinate be some kind of brick. And so the holes are what is programed specifically.
Also I believe they also had mega sprites, that's when, instead of storing the positions of individual tiles, it stores the position of a programmed collection of sprites. Like the stairs/hills foe example, there's like a 4x4 bundle of blocks arranged into the stair pattern, and you just place the pattern instead of the individual blocks.
This is a technique that they often used in many of their games when they were strapped for space."
Super Mario Bros.,"Game Devs then: we studied the console and got the game under 1mb, we could've done much better😞

Game Devs now: sorry guys we can't release the game right now, the game crashes when you exit the game 😢😢"
Super Mario Bros.,It takes 7 times the amount of Nintendo cartridges to make ONE full hd photo with your phone.
Super Mario Bros.,The goombas are a modifed sprite of a super mushroom
Super Mario Bros.,On the palace where you start players when you use A and B it will change the stage
Super Mario Bros.,You see if with all the cut corners it is so well done you dont even realise it
Super Mario Bros.,Luigi has the same color scheme as koopas and bowser
Super Mario Bros.,And the Goomba walk are 2 frames
Super Mario Bros.,42 kilos.
Super Mario Bros.,Hey where's new employee
Super Mario Bros.,i always lnew this about the game and thought it was kinda smart ngl
Super Mario Bros.,"I got 2 questions for you
1: have you watched the mario movie and if you have what did you think
2: do you have Diddy kong racing?"
Super Mario Bros.,"Goombas only have one sprite, which is just flipped while they’re walking"
Super Mario Bros.,some i already did
Super Mario Bros.,Yes
Super Mario Bros.,Why is your super Mario case in such good condition god damn
Super Mario Bros.,This information is of the highest import (it's also refusing to load for me 😤
Super Mario Bros.,Back when Luigi was Green Mario.
Super Mario Bros.,Amazing game only 32kb while trash these days is 320gb
Super Mario Bros.,Everyone is wrong about the size of the game. It's 30.79 KB.
Super Mario Bros.,If you look close enough the sky on all the maps are the same unless it a different style of map
Super Mario Bros.,"Channel keeps getting worse, lol."
Super Mario Bros.,i love the old school SMB fun fact that’s just “toad’s sprite flips you off” that’s funny
Super Mario Bros.,Also the actual Nes contains 2Kb ram.
Super Mario Bros.,The Mushroom Sprite and Goomba Sprite are the same shape but the goomba has feet and they are different colors.
Super Mario Bros.,"@1980sgamer1 if you didn't use any of your nintendo wii u it can be bricked
So test them

Pov:nintendo:we are sorry for what happends for the wii u please consider buying an nintendo switch"
Super Mario Bros.,"This is widely known. 
Even most zoomers know this."
Super Mario Bros.,Omg and all the bricks are exactly the same too!!!!
Super Mario Bros.,Yes actually I knew these facts and I don’t know why lol
Super Mario Bros.,Can you play this game with random people online?
Super Mario Bros.,"it's a fun cute little game 
but shouldn't cost the 65usd it still cost so many years into it's release

it's a 40usd max game.
not a 65 usd one

but everything is more expensive nowdays"
Super Mario Bros.,Is it worth $59
Super Mario Bros.,It’s still 60 bux wtf
Super Mario Bros.,"C'mon, IGN. Are you really gonna give THIS GAME an 8 out of 10? Did you seriously forget how it has a little something for everyone?"
Super Mario Bros.,This is the most frustrating game to play… argh.
Super Mario Bros.,It has a little something for everyone.
Super Mario Bros.,Doesn't mention Tropical Freeze as a peer that trounces this :S
Super Mario Bros.,This game makes you feel like mario
Super Mario Bros.,This game makes you feel like mario
Super Mario Bros.,Luigi U is not a mobile game! Are you insane?
Super Mario Bros.,Waited 20 years for? What was Mario Bros Wii a bad game according to y’all?
Super Mario Bros.,"Bro the Wii U was so mucch fun too, im not even sure why it is hated on."
Super Mario Bros.,Mairo u deluxe is way better than Rayman. It gets 10 from me or at least a 9
Super Mario Bros.,Dumbass game
Super Mario Bros.,"It’s crazy how every 2D Mario is basically the same game but they still remain fun and full of life somehow, the old saying goes if it’s not broke don’t fix it."
Super Mario Bros.,"Nintendo really should do a bundle and include a bunch of 2D mario games like the wii version, the 3ds and then the wii u version. That would make the £50 price tag fair enough"
Super Mario Bros.,Love it
Super Mario Bros.,Got it for 10 dollars
Super Mario Bros.,Easily the second best Mario game on switch behind odyssey
Super Mario Bros.,Didn't even mention the co-op.... kind of a big deal on a review
Super Mario Bros.,8/10 it doesn't have a little something for everyone
Super Mario Bros.,Is this online multiplayer?
Super Mario Bros.,Every modern Kirby is better than this Game!
Super Mario Bros.,0/10 it has a little something for everyone
Super Mario Bros.,Nice
Super Mario Bros.,If I never had a Wii U should I get it?
Super Mario Bros.,Why does toadette turn into peach. I still don’t get that lol
Super Mario Bros.,Should I get this or super Mario world 3D/bowsers fury for all the family to play together on the couch
Super Mario Bros.,"This game is boring the Wii u version when I got it, I completed it in like a week I think the WII VERSION WAS BETTER AND MORE FUN Nintendo removed the propeller power up in the Wii u version 😭 but its in the deluxe version?? WTF"
Super Mario Bros.,The wii u is so underrated. Love the console
Super Mario Bros.,"So am I understanding correctly....this is a Wii U game update, that's not on the ""Wii U"" but on the switch only?"
Super Mario Bros.,Finally grabbed it today for 26 bucks on black Friday
Super Mario Bros.,Does it have a little something for everyone?
Super Mario Bros.,Well its 60 dollars because it has 2 games
Super Mario Bros.,This is goin on my christmas list lol
Super Mario Bros.,"I prefer this than any of the 3D games. Classic, simple Mario."
Super Mario Bros.,Super Mario is just the stupidest game on earth
Super Mario Bros.,"I’ll be honest. I don’t like this game at all. It’s not a bad game by itself, but it’s the only Wii U port that is actually WORSE than the original game. If you want to play NSMBU and Luigi U and still have a Wii U, get those versions."
Super Mario Bros.,this game should vbe 15 dollars. ITS 60 DOLLARS AND IT LOOKS SO BAD IN GRAPHICS
Super Mario Bros.,"NSMB Tier list.

S Tier: NSMBDS and NSMBW

A tier: none

B tier: NSMBU

C tier: NSMBUD

D: NSMB2"
Super Mario Bros.,It has a little bit of something for everyone
Super Mario Bros.,"Please reply someone! I swear I remember being able to play mario with a friend (local co-op) at the same time on the original ones, however when I tried it with the nes it didn't seem to work, it was more like die by die, just wondering how co-op is on this??? Thanks!"
Super Mario Bros.,"""Raymen Legends is more fun with friends""


Are you sure about that?"
Super Mario Bros.,828288298/10 its expensive but the most best game
Super Mario Bros.,I'll buy it for $20
Super Mario Bros.,"This was a nice ‘wiiview’





I’m sorry"
Super Mario Bros.,Is it a online
Super Mario Bros.,I hate this game they removed a toad
Super Mario Bros.,it has a little something for everyone
Super Mario Bros.,To me I still like this game and speedrun this
Super Mario Bros.,how is this game an 8 yet battle for bikini bottom re-hydrated is a 5
Super Mario Bros.,"In the future, I'm gonna make a comment like this: 
The nostalgia of waking up on Easter, Thanksgiving, Christmas, or any random family party, having everyone coming over or going over to their house, and saying hi to all your cousins, aunts, uncles, then taking our food upstairs to our rooms (even though we were not allowed to) while the adults were talking or watching TV, turning on the Switch, taking Super Mario Party out, and putting New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe into your Switch, and seeing file 1 completed, file 2 halfway completed, and file 3 still on world 1 that you started with you, your sister/brother, and your 2 cousins. We also argued on who got to be Mario."
Super Mario Bros.,There aren’t many 2 D Mario games for the switch and this is some classic fun.
Super Mario Bros.,It has a little something for everyone!
Super Mario Bros.,“It has a little something for everyone”
Super Mario Bros.,I wish Nintendo wouldn't sell games at their original price several years after their release
Super Mario Bros.,Does this guy know nslu isn’t new I got it with my nsmbu on Wii u and it was it’s own game
Super Mario Bros.,I almost feel like they should've used the same person who reviewed the Wii U version to review the port 🤔
Super Mario Bros.,Can you play this multiplayer with two Nintendo switch lites?
Super Mario Bros.,I can’t be the only one who thinks seeing a Mario character in 2D swim in multiple directions is really weird.
Super Mario Bros.,"I got NSMB on Wii U, but didn't 100% it, and I haven't bought Luigi U. Is it worth getting it again for Switch? (Ignoring SMM2 by the way in this question)"
Super Mario Bros.,Toadette ftw!!🍄👗✊
Super Mario Bros.,"Guys, as desperate as you are please dont buy from Scalpers. Let them rot with their overpriced stuff and dont be a victim!


Do your research. Stay safe."
Super Mario Bros.,I will pick it up on my bday
Super Mario Bros.,"8 really, that standard for trash todays age"
Super Mario Bros.,For everyone saying why are they charging 60 dollars for it AGAIN i agree but nintendo did it because the wii u didn’t have enough people buying it which also caused less people buying mario bros u so they obviously decided to port it to switch for extra money from die hard fans and money from people who didn’t buy the wii u
Super Mario Bros.,"Why does Mario run like *SONIC* if u hold the run button. 

I swear I rage on this game"
Super Mario Bros.,downvoting the video just because it is IGN
Super Mario Bros.,"Question, the last 2d Mario game I played was new super Mario bro’s wii back in 2010. I loved it.. is this one better?"
Super Mario Bros.,Great review by this guy.
Super Mario Bros.,How are you reviewing something that has already been reviewed a few years ago wtf
Super Mario Bros.,"This game is so gorgeous. The level themes make it feel like SMB3. Glad we have this game, but I think the next Mario 2D platformer should break new ground. Something new. Maybe 2D version of Super Mario Galaxy or a new, unique land to explore or something."
Super Mario Bros.,I find this game way more fun if you play with family or friends. This brings back memories of playing co-op on Nintendo Wii. I enjoy it 9/10.
Super Mario Bros.,2/10 amazing difficulty
Super Mario Bros.,How amiibo card can be used in new Super Mario bros U deluxe
Super Mario Bros.,9/10 epic nostalgic game
Super Mario Bros.,I would buy it if it were $30 instead of $60!
Super Mario Bros.,can we get a remake of donkey kong 64 or a donkey kong odyssey
Super Mario Bros.,But does it have a little something for everyone?...
Super Mario Bros.,"""It has a little something for everyone"""
Super Mario Bros.,"i'm not a nintendo fans, but damn....no 2d or semi 3d sidescrolling adventure games better like Mario series....the creativity that nintendo had for this series is unlimited and amazing"
Super Mario Bros.,Who's looking at this for black Friday deal :) ?
Super Mario Bros.,The reason it didn't get a 9 was because it didn't have a little something for everyone.
Super Mario Bros.,"Which should I buy first for my switch:
Mario bros
Mario odyssey 
Mario smash bros 
Super Mario maker 2

Please help 😀"
Super Mario Bros.,It lowered in walmart
Super Mario Bros.,"6 out of 10 no NSMB Wii to Make an Exceptional Deluxe, Just The 2D versions from Wii U ports NSMB U and Luigi U, Not Deluxe Enough."
Super Mario Bros.,"This video is nitpicking and biased, bye bye I win"
Super Mario Bros.,What triggers me is the price
Super Mario Bros.,this is $15 game
Super Mario Bros.,"IGN, why do you compare a 3D game to a 2D game? Dumbasses."
Super Mario Bros.,0/10 blue toad is a costume
Super Mario Bros.,"yuck
2/10"
Super Mario Bros.,6/10
Super Mario Bros.,Same formula with better graphics?
Super Mario Bros.,I'm having a hard time choosing between this and Smash. Any suggestions?
Super Mario Bros.,ryman > mario now
Super Mario Bros.,Why didn’t they port New Super Mario Bros Wii along with U for this port? I wish they had done that.
Super Mario Bros.,Hmmmm......peachette vs pink gold peach
Super Mario Bros.,Multiplayer mode isn't mentioned. Can we play multiplayer?
Super Mario Bros.,I saw it in the electronic shop and was fascinated by it. I am not a gamer at all but I had a couple of game and watch back in the day. I ended up it buying it online. I guess it's a nostalgia thing for me.
Super Mario Bros.,"Very cool. I had no idea about Game & Watch until I filmed a video in Pune, India, where this guy had a massive collection from the 80s! Now I'm going to give it a go with this and gift it to my little nephew."
Super Mario Bros.,I just bought it I always wanted to get my hands on one of these I can't wait till it gets here
Super Mario Bros.,They should make a Pokémon one or metroid
Super Mario Bros.,I have one of these and I take it to school  And they are 100% OK with it
Super Mario Bros.,"I remember when the original game & watch games came out like in 1982. Loved them all, only had one that I can remember."
Super Mario Bros.,I'm gonna get this just to bring back memories for my mom (she played mario as a kid)
Super Mario Bros.,But it only has 3 games on it..? It's the first game and watch ever that has 3 games on it.. And these together actually have a lot of levels to play..
Super Mario Bros.,what about the original nes which you didint mention that i got a few month before this came out a i was 9 years old
Super Mario Bros.,"Not going to lie, bought the zelda and smb as a set for 70 and the big draw to me was the clocks which just are so fricking cool, heck the clocks are more of interactive and game like than the original game and watches that bore the super mario bros and legend of zelda games."
Super Mario Bros.,Oh man…this brings me back to grade school back in the 80’s. This was the THE gadget to be seen with and you were super cool if you had one! lmao.
Super Mario Bros.,Nintendo Game And Watch Google
Super Mario Bros.,"looks cool and nostalgic aesthetically, but those brick shaped controllers hurt my hands as a kid and also as an adult..."
Super Mario Bros.,If they made one Tetris themed take my money
Super Mario Bros.,Just left wal-mart...they had 12 for 75% off. Grabbed them all.
Super Mario Bros.,When I get this im gonna bring it to school
Super Mario Bros.,I know the PlayStation five is selling like crazy and same with the Xbox series X but this is the real best console of the 9th generation Not only can I play it when I’m in the toilet but I don’t need to hook it up to anything best console of all time
Super Mario Bros.,I have it
Super Mario Bros.,"Glad I watched this.. Like yourself I have fond memories of the original ""Game & Watch"" handhelds...   Glad because as the 35th anniversary title would suggest. It's not what I'm looking for.... I'm only after original boxed versions from the early 80's.  Similar to Hornby.. I couldn't give a toss about modern copies."
Super Mario Bros.,They could've put SMB3 and other GAWs on there.
Super Mario Bros.,Got one.    Keeping it sealed.    Got the games on my PS Vita.
Super Mario Bros.,I know of a guy in NY that bought like 10 of these and had them on sale for 200 usd each. Talk about a scammer
Super Mario Bros.,Game & Watch has been an enjoyable experience so far for myself
Super Mario Bros.,"In case anybody's curious he said ""cute"" 6 times."
Super Mario Bros.,"Switch was THAT big of a failure that Nintendo had to make another handheld to sell, because Switch isn't selling?? DAMN!"
Super Mario Bros.,If only they had just added SMB3 it would've been perfect.
Super Mario Bros.,I wish they had the alarm
Super Mario Bros.,Nintendo making it just 3 games they call it a day
Super Mario Bros.,Just call it game and stare since you just stare at the clock
Super Mario Bros.,As a mario fan that hes mom is a mario fan when shes kid  id like to buy that well i got it
Super Mario Bros.,I wonder if u can mod it to run other games.
Super Mario Bros.,"TOO MUCH BLAH BLAH, YOU NEVER TOLD US THE SCREEN IS COLORED. IT WAS NOT COLORED BEFORE."
Super Mario Bros.,"My wife just said, game and watch what?"
Super Mario Bros.,Didn't the Gameboy micro copy the game and watch look first?
Super Mario Bros.,I had one that had a transparent screen like a window pane where you could look through and see what's behind it. Unfortunately I lost the device. I guess it's an expensive collector's item today.
Super Mario Bros.,I took the time to purchase it from Wal-Mart online and I'm looking to open it once delivered.
Super Mario Bros.,Is it good as a christmas gift?
Super Mario Bros.,GHE WATCH
Super Mario Bros.,ماريو كلاسيك 😵‍💫❤️‍🔥
Super Mario Bros.,"Stupid little device to make few extra dollars, nintendo's mindset."
Super Mario Bros.,YES to a game and watch black and white compendium !!!
Super Mario Bros.,Just purchased this today at a brick and mortar target.
Super Mario Bros.,Some of the games came with a metal holder that you could click out so the game could stand. I wish this game had that so you could put it on a shelf showing the clock
Super Mario Bros.,They should have put Mario Bros 3
Super Mario Bros.,That's 50 dollars usd?!? I live on California and that think cost 120 dollars usd in target and Walmart
Super Mario Bros.,ma posso usare uno spinotto di caricabatterie per Samsung e poi collego li il cavo che c'è in dotazione con la scatola o devo avere per forza uno spinotto Nintendo
Super Mario Bros.,Шевчук блять😆
Super Mario Bros.,I have one of those
Super Mario Bros.,I really like handheld consoles cuz bringing them to school but im too scared for my switch so this will help a lot
Super Mario Bros.,"Nintendo is still a thing?  I found this video when looking for a way to play old Mario games on my PS5. Stunned Nintendo still exists, 🤯"
Super Mario Bros.,The game and watch is not new they just brought it back out in 2020  it originally came out in the 90s
Super Mario Bros.,If i had 100$ will i buy this for 50$?
Super Mario Bros.,"Love the channel, been watching you for years but there's a super Mario game and watch already, the old blue one, you member!!"
Super Mario Bros.,real question is … can you hack it ?
Super Mario Bros.,2:52 what game is that?
Super Mario Bros.,2:52 what game is that?
Super Mario Bros.,"I had theese back in the 80s and loved them :) When I got the new one in my hand I was a bit dissapointed. First of all. The screen is smaller than they used to be (why not the ""widescreen""). Secondly the plastic seems lighter and cheaper. Even the buttons feels cheaper (They were softer before). The clip is missing too on the backside. My favourite from the 80s were ""fire attack"". But that one is considered too ""stereotype"" today so they will not make it. Also the old ones was LCD games. Not the kind of ""modern"" gameplay as this."
Super Mario Bros.,I'm only here to watch a review because i have a high chance of getting one for 2 pound on ebay UK currency. And it's 40 at usual stores
Super Mario Bros.,It looks like a good or alright game. But I believe it cost too much. 59.99 is way too high for that. I'm sorry my opinion.
Super Mario Bros.,“You don’t need this thing”….shush your mouth!  My wife isn’t listening right now.
Super Mario Bros.,now u can get link
Super Mario Bros.,Whoa...big bugman.
Super Mario Bros.,"The Game & Watch _had_ Super Mario Bros. Both in the new widescreen and the crystal screen versions. And that game's sadly missing on this G&W release. :( It'd have been the much better G&W game to include instead of ""Ball""."
Super Mario Bros.,I don’t need it. But I want it.
Super Mario Bros.,I never playing game and watch but do I had switch but might steel get this one. Cause I love retro old 80s like I got still got gameboy pocket yellow versions and also got ds
Super Mario Bros.,Just bought one today
Super Mario Bros.,I have one. To
Super Mario Bros.,"Can’t take my switch to work, I can with this."
Super Mario Bros.,"It’s 30 dollars here, I might get one."
Super Mario Bros.,I just bought it today thru online
Super Mario Bros.,"It's these type of devices that really work for me. While I have a Switch and utilise the NES collection on there (and the classic) at least a few times a week, I will always opt to use my original NES and the cart (for the games that I do have) because it's mono-focused. That is, I don't have a massive range of options, I just have the game and I find a lot more enjoyment and immersion that way. I'm going to pick one up right now online in fact."
Super Mario Bros.,"Now that they have the red and gold one for Mario, and the green and gold one for Zelda, I hope next year they do one for Metroid. Maybe make it purple and silver?"
Super Mario Bros.,They need to make a Pokémon game and watch
Super Mario Bros.,it's a pretty cool dust collector.
Super Mario Bros.,Actually the Pokémon mini is the smallest Nintendo system
Super Mario Bros.,700$
Super Mario Bros.,"I don't think the word ""watch"" in this case means clock. ;)"
Super Mario Bros.,"Stupid idea by Nintendo. Tiny little screen, no alarm, expensive, & just a game that we can all play anywhere else for free if you already own a copy or digital! How about a mini (N64)?!! That would make ton of sense, Nintendo!"
Super Mario Bros.,"if they started dropping game and watches of NES games, I would 100% start collecting these. Yeah I can  play them on the switch, but the switch still isn't a game and watch. they fit a different niche. People are willing to buy amiibos and they barely do anything besides look cool and give you items in games."
Super Mario Bros.,I remember when I was a kid and had the OG Game & Watch Black & White LCD games from the early 1980’s.
Super Mario Bros.,I got wanna theses and the handheld feels like a piece of jewelry
Super Mario Bros.,It would have been cool if it had super mario 3 too
Super Mario Bros.,It is Apollo good
Super Mario Bros.,"It's kind of neat, but also a waste that nice screen will only ever see Mario 1. If Nintendo added more memory and changed the look, they could make a great GBA Classic mini."
Super Mario Bros.,Noo you just teared 660000 usd 🤣
Super Mario Bros.,I'd pay good money if they make a handheld with all the old school street fighter games 💸
Super Mario Bros.,"I bought it!

and I love it!

Very retro haha!"
Super Mario Bros.,Thank you for the review poindexter.
Super Mario Bros.,"I Loved This Thing When I Got It! Though It Was Disappointing For It To Only Have 3 Games, One Of Them Is a Remake Of Ball, It's Still Awesome! Sadly, This Thing Won't Be Avaliable Forever Which Is Very Sad Because This Is Something People Would Want, But Nintendo Is Giving Us a Time Limit To Get It Or We'll Miss It"
Super Mario Bros.,Can I have half of your hair?
Super Mario Bros.,Got one for my 8yo ASD kiddo who is obsessed with classic super mario bros. This was *perfect* and what a great tribute; a classic wrapped in a classic.
Super Mario Bros.,"My child within says; Get it, get it now, pronto"
Super Mario Bros.,Super fruatrating. Not a single clear 360 shot of the console:( or a presentation
Super Mario Bros.,Only 3 games? Wtf
Super Mario Bros.,Horribly overpriced for 3 games.  Come on Nintendo.
Super Mario Bros.,"""The game and watch never had Super Mario Bros"" you need to do some research, back in 1986 there was a Super Mario Bros unit released, they're called ""Game And Watch"" because it has a game and it's a watch, just because you don't wear it on your wrist doesn't mean it's not a watch, it's a time piece non the less, I'm guessing you're around 40? It would seem you never got to experience Game and Watch in it's original release in 1980, for those of us who did, this release is a very exciting thing."
Super Mario Bros.,A watch?..but where’s the strap?
Super Mario Bros.,I'm buying one I'm in Trinidad and Tobago and a Nintendo switch in a game store cost 1300 online costs 1000 but this for 50 dollars online it will cost 350 so I got that going for me.
Super Mario Bros.,I have it the graphics and screen looks expensive amazing brilliant and sounds just like the original game
Super Mario Bros.,"50 years from now, this will be worth at least $100. I better go buy one"
Mario Kart Wii,My childhood favorite racing game!
Mario Kart Wii,Came here as an active online 2023 MKW player to see what they got right and what they got wrong
Mario Kart Wii,"3:20 Fourteen years later, Mario Kart finally got an item editor."
Mario Kart Wii,"This is the most dogshit mariokart I’ve ever played. Genuinely horrible

(Joke)"
Mario Kart Wii,The video looks great being from 2008 and at 480p.
Mario Kart Wii,I’ll stick to NHL Slapshot
Mario Kart Wii,hi

Mario Kart Wii,Happy Early 13th BDAY to Mario Kart Wii
Mario Kart Wii,lol
Mario Kart Wii,Game still alive. Mariokart ctgb
Mario Kart Wii,I don't like racing games in general but I loved this one and I still have it!
Mario Kart Wii,Hello again!
Mario Kart Wii,This was in my recommended and I’m not even mad 😭
Mario Kart Wii,"nintendo switch jogos
mario kart 2008"
Mario Kart Wii,"Professionally and casually, I thoroughly enjoyed this game. If you didn’t, Mario Kart isn’t the game for you and you don’t have friends."
Mario Kart Wii,It's not supposed to be the best Mario kart game on paper but it is after playing it.
Mario Kart Wii,"“Will piss off competitive players.” Yea sure pal, as if we don’t still play in 2020"
Mario Kart Wii,Who's here because of 2020 quarantine and is broke to buy a ps5
Mario Kart Wii,Who's here in 2020
Mario Kart Wii,2:16 sorry i dont speak wrong
Mario Kart Wii,Got this recommended 12 years later wtf
Mario Kart Wii,Still a great game to play today!
Mario Kart Wii,Why was this recommended to me after 12 years
Mario Kart Wii,Can't wait for this game to come out!!!
Mario Kart Wii,"Mariokart wii comes out: it's okay
Breath of the wild comes out: mariokart wii has a better open world"
Mario Kart Wii,Ah 2008 when people actually used karts
Mario Kart Wii,2:20 he said bikes and karts were both balanced
Mario Kart Wii,I miss playing Mario kart wii online. 😭
Mario Kart Wii,The old IGN
Mario Kart Wii,I can’t believe I unlocked all the characters when I was younger
Mario Kart Wii,"Ign owned gamespy, the company that hosted nintendo wfc."
Mario Kart Wii,glad this is in my recommendations
Mario Kart Wii,"1. Mk wii
2. Mk dd
3. Mk 7"
Mario Kart Wii,"Can’t believe there are others who hate this Mario Kart. Wii is not only the best game in the series, it’s the best racer and one of the best games ever made."
Mario Kart Wii,sounds like this game isnt worth playing at all on 150cc and above because of the impossible AI
Mario Kart Wii,This game deserves a remake
Mario Kart Wii,2:16 Lmao bikes are much better
Mario Kart Wii,2019 will make 11 years I been subbed to IGN 💪🏾❤️🥰
Mario Kart Wii,this review is old
Mario Kart Wii,"2:16
...
Lol"
Mario Kart Wii,Dang..... this game is over 10 years old.... still the best Mario Kart in my opinion
Mario Kart Wii,2018 anyone?
Mario Kart Wii,"Dumbest Mario Kart game ever!!

I am 24 years old and I cannot unlock anybody besides King Boo, Rosalina, and Diddy Kong."
Mario Kart Wii,Well who’s here in 2018?
Mario Kart Wii,Most of my childhood was spent playin this one game it means so much to me
Mario Kart Wii,Mario kart wiis online is better then offline?
Mario Kart Wii,Neither bikes or carts overpower each other? Really?!
Mario Kart Wii,“Checkout mario kart wii” I could if my disc wasnt scratched
Mario Kart Wii,I am here form a nmead video
Mario Kart Wii,2018
Mario Kart Wii,Who's here in 2018?
Mario Kart Wii,This review is by the same guy who did that amazing ninjabread man review!
Mario Kart Wii,This and Mario Kart DS are the best Mario Karts to date!
Mario Kart Wii,I found a working copy of this game in a desk downstairs. Thought I lost it!
Mario Kart Wii,I got this game when i was 7. I beat 150cc first week
Mario Kart Wii,"150cc is hard, hah. Good one IGN. This review surprisingly still holds up (to an extent) today."
Mario Kart Wii,"This video made me wanna play MKWii again. Then I realised that sad moment when the race I was in at the time, online, suddenly stopped, and Nintendo WFC was never to be seen again."
Mario Kart Wii,Why am I watching this? It came out NINE years ago.
Mario Kart Wii,I have to give this game a perfect 10/10! It's my favorite game in the series!
Mario Kart Wii,2018 anyone? Happy 10 year anniversary for this game 😄
Mario Kart Wii,"When you play the game a lot, it's not that hard. Especially if you play on wiimifi, you need to be good at the game. Mkwii= 98/10"
Mario Kart Wii,Who still plays this? *Me* ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Mario Kart Wii,Bad Review srysly
Mario Kart Wii,You never talked about op characters like rosalina and funky kong
Mario Kart Wii,prob 7
Mario Kart Wii,lol i beat 150cc when i was like 7
Mario Kart Wii,150cc is hard?Even 200cc isn't that hard...
Mario Kart Wii,"Pffft, 150cc is easy. Obviously, it's not going to be as easy as 50cc, I mean, what did you expect? It's supposed to be a challenge, but it's nowhere near impossible. Also, for that part where you were saying that there were balancing issues in a 2 player race, you are completely wrong. The cloud isn't a 2nd place item, in fact, it's usually found near the middle-end part of the pack, and although it may electrocute you in the end, it gives you a boost before it does. So in all, I think there were some flaws in your review. 

I give your review 7.8/10
Not enough kart."
Mario Kart Wii,I'm still playing this game lol
Mario Kart Wii,Halsey St
Mario Kart Wii,Who remembers this gem of a game
Mario Kart Wii,it not about the graphics it about the gameplay like if you agree
Mario Kart Wii,I still love this game even its old this game is not dead yet
Mario Kart Wii,"Multi player is amazing now, we have hackers and...... no multi player"
Mario Kart Wii,150cc isn't that hard
Mario Kart Wii,"A game that made my child hood 10000000 times better, especially the online which unfortunately shut down"
Mario Kart Wii,Who's watching this in 2017?
Mario Kart Wii,Mario Kart before the character roster turned to crud.
Mario Kart Wii,who's here in 2017
Mario Kart Wii,The online has a lot of FTW hackers
Mario Kart Wii,"150cc hard to play? Sounds like a personal problem.

Pleb better Git Gud, cause this is sad"
Mario Kart Wii,mirror mode was the hardest for me
Mario Kart Wii,To this I say HA
Mario Kart Wii,Good old times (;
Mario Kart Wii,Everyone who says r.i.p mkwii no online go to Mrbean35000vr and there is a tutorial of how to get custom tracks as well as that online with normal tracks and custom tracks!
Mario Kart Wii,"mk8 is better but having played it a lot something was missing.
For pure gameplay there is something about this one which gives it the edge.
MK8 just feels a bit over polished"
Mario Kart Wii,WFC is back dont worry guys do not worry mkwii memories are back lets get loads of people to get online again it would be amazing!
Mario Kart Wii,people have gone to mario kart 8 now mkwii is well better in my opinion the graphics of mk8 are well better but mkwii is much more fun has a lot of great memories online was unbelievable i play this game everyday and i always will do even though i completed everythink i have online back loads of people go back on online wiimmfi so fun and just an amazing game overall
Mario Kart Wii,This game is by far the best mario kart wii to be honest i dont think they can make one better so much to do so much fun espicially online which i still have you can still get online using wiimmfi look it up on youtube and google and you can get it back so simple and easy!
Mario Kart Wii,Mario Kart Wii is my favorite mario kart game
Mario Kart Wii,"to me, one of the worst MK games ever. Should have looked more like Mario Kart Arcade"
Mario Kart Wii,Alright. Great.
Mario Kart Wii,Sorry but this looks so bad comparing to Mario Kart 8
Mario Kart Wii,This is truly one of the best games nintendo has every made.
Mario Kart Wii,this game is awesome
Mario Kart Wii,7.8/10 Too much kart
Mario Kart Wii,I managed to do 150cc. I did go through some serious torture porn with the AI but it's a lot of fun. But I'm pissed that they took down WFC. But in the end I think it's time for our family to upgrade to a Wii U. So we can play Mario Kart 8 and get new games for the TV room as Nintendo systems are our family systems. 
Mario Kart Wii,"15:44 There are hints of the old style battle mode returning with Tour, plus your able to use items after you’ve been knocked. While still timed, it’s about a five minute long so you’ll easily finish a battle in time."
Mario Kart Wii,"I absolutely *love* MK wii the most out of any in the series, but I don't think it's the best. This was a great analysis on it. I was just playing it recently and OMG THE BLUE SHELLS I KNOW"
Mario Kart Wii,6:55 Because I like Wario more
Mario Kart Wii,"Dude I NEVER KNEW the automatic and manual was about drift until today.......and I'm 22 years old........

I NEVER even seen the logo in the corner until today.........you just really undid my whole childhood theory on those automatic and manual options......."
Mario Kart Wii,Wait…THERE’S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KARTS AND BIKES?!??
Mario Kart Wii,"Despite me disagreeing with some of the points made in this video, this is a very fair video. I am in the camp of being nostalgic for this game. This is also my favorite mk. I do admit, however, that it is not for everyone and there are flaws to the game. People just prefer different things. Thanks for the review! Very good and fair. 👍"
Mario Kart Wii,The Giga chads who are competitive but also grew up with mkwii: time it break the world record for longest number of blue shells in a race. (Gets 20 blue shells in one race on n64 bowsers castle)
Mario Kart Wii,"I really don't like DK summit, because of the pink snow, skiing shy guys, and also whenever i see a skiing mountain it makes me have flashbacks   to the HTF short called ""Ski ya don't wanna be ya""."
Mario Kart Wii,he think the game is bad. grrrr
Mario Kart Wii,"Silok: ""I am not very good with bikes.""
Also Silok: *Falls off on Rainbow Road... You know... The track where bikes are useless...*"
Mario Kart Wii,😅 You DO lose points in ballons battle
Mario Kart Wii,I never actually got the game until just recently i bought nintendo wii and well i gotta say it’s my least favourite mario kart game
Mario Kart Wii,"Idk if u didnt play this game enough or smth, it doesnt take long for u to charge the drift, u just have to smash left and right and if u do it fast enough u get almost insta boost. U are missinformating mate"
Mario Kart Wii,"In my eyes, this or MK64 takes the cake for worst MK ever. Apparently it is NOT usual that you lose your very ITEM at each barrage and bombardment you receive. My experience, however, was that I motherfucking did. I hate the steering, I hate that I lost my items on most hits I took. Fuck. This. Game."
Mario Kart Wii,Is it still worth buying when I already own Double Dash and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe? What do you think?
Mario Kart Wii,thank god the days of the waluigi + wiggler + roller wheels came to an end on mario kart 8 deluxe after years of torture
Mario Kart Wii,You're talking to fast for me
Mario Kart Wii,You are just bad.
Mario Kart Wii,"What always held this game back was how chaotic it is. For example, you got mario Kart's video and 9 freaking blue shells, and mario Kart wii does come down to luck and not skill"
Mario Kart Wii,As a mk wii player i honestly feel babysat playing any other mk game because of how harsh the game i grew up with was.
Mario Kart Wii,"I just...honestly can't think of anything that Mario Kart 8 did better than this game other than visuals. I'm sorry, but this one just has much better controls, especially with the bikes...bikes and karts actually felt like they played differently. Wii has the way better new courses, and as busted as the items can feel in this game, 8 is even worse in that regard because red shells are beyond overpowered and take zero skill. Mario Kart 8 encourages spamming power items immediately while Wii encourages using them strategically. To me it's not the same as Melee because while Melee may be the most technical, it is way harder for a new player to get into than the newest game due to the controls, while this game actively controls better than its successor and it's easier to find a combination that works for you. For all the criticisms you listed that sound legitimate, I felt that you did some cherrypicking to make things appear worse in this game, especially with the items and steering.
 
I don't hate Mario Kart 8, but while I appreciate a lot of the effort that went into its presentation, I find this game to play much more fun and would recommend it first to any new player unless they were extremely young/casual to the point where the auto steer stuff would be necessary"
Mario Kart Wii,21:04 HEY TROY!!!
Mario Kart Wii,"17:12  Splatoon in a nutshell. Thats why I've come to regret ever playing it. It's just an inherent flaw with team based games, so yeah it really does suck when you dont have a choice."
Mario Kart Wii,"Something dumb about the POW block, is that since this game can be played with a gamecube controller, every action (including shaking) is mapped to a button. Now, instead of dodging it very easily, all you have to do is mash all of the D-Pad buttons as soon as you see the POW appear and get out scot-free."
Mario Kart Wii,"Finally, someone not saying this game is the best game to ever be made. I have a lot of problems with this game, like how many items and hazards make you lose your item, and the rubber-banding AI making 100% completion painful, but I do still believe that its a good game and the 2nd best mario kart game I've played, with the 1st being 8 Deluxe."
Mario Kart Wii,"I often play VS mode with 150cc and easy CPU's. Sometimes, I even end up 2nd place or worse thanks to the spiny shell bombardment. Also I agree with the overuse of the bloom shader. I also never had fun playing Coin Runners since for some reason, there are POW blocks, which hits EVERYONE in a team, which can basically decide the game. Team VS also sucked because it's mostly luck if you got decent team members.
 
But man, I had such a nice time with that game, it's almost nostalgic for me. The character roster was pretty good, besides the extra babies. I also love that Peach, Daisy & Rosalina got nice looking racing suits when using bikes. Also playing as your Mii was pretty nice, at least you're not forced to wear a helmet. Also, you got to see the characters celebrating on a podest after the VS or Grand Prix, where in any other Mario Kart after Wii, you just see a trophy, the stats and that's it."
Mario Kart Wii,to be honest the tracks for this mode are some of the best in any mariokart game but the mechanics suck for this battle mode
Mario Kart Wii,"This game was great. I played this game a lot as a kid,  it I never finished it.. still really fun though!"
Mario Kart Wii,"I think one problem I have with the items is trying to unlock the characters, like getting 1 star for every grand prix on a certain cc is pretty annoying"
Mario Kart Wii,I only played Mario kart ads and 8
Mario Kart Wii,"Mega Mushroom, POW Block and Thundercloud NEED to return in a next Mario Kart. Of course with a rework"
Mario Kart Wii,Put in 2x speed. . . it’s worth it
Mario Kart Wii,Exma was here 🍞🍞🍞
Mario Kart Wii,Arrgghhh I'm disagreeing and not listening to your well-explained reasoning
Mario Kart Wii,Ayyyyyy! I draw tracks too!
Mario Kart Wii,"14:11 No offense here but I’m just here to correct something.
The bloom effect is visible here because of how emulation works, on actual Wii Hardware the bloom effect isn’t really visible. How do I know? I’ve been playing this game on emulator and real hardware."
Mario Kart Wii,Honestly the best part i remember from wii was hunting character unlocks since there were so many with a lot of different conditions to get them actually looking up what i needed to do and trying to get them was a lot of fun.
Mario Kart Wii,U forgot to bring up ultra shortcuts which I feel like is a very big part of the game
Mario Kart Wii,just get gud
Mario Kart Wii,"A huge fan of this game, but I like all your points. None of them are a dealbreaker to me, but nothing gets better unless we give constructive criticism"
Mario Kart Wii,"When me and my siblings first played the game and we got to the manual and automatic screen for drifting, we thought automatic meant the car goes for you and you didn’t have to press the acceleration button. Good times good times😂"
Mario Kart Wii,so I am the zoomer you were talking about as this was the first game I really played and my childhood. And yes the wii wheel is kinda strange but it helped my mom play this game so I like them. also I love you used TWD98 footage as I love watching him.
Mario Kart Wii,"this game is pretty darn overrated to me
why do people think it's amazing

it is  great, but not a S tier game
A+ for me"
Mario Kart Wii,"25:50 “ how bad can it be?” 

Reminds me of the ending to Wreck-It Ralph"
Mario Kart Wii,"A comment on the blue shells, I rarely get them but when I notice this they always come, 

“I haven’t been hit with a blue shell In ages”

Nintendo: “ok here’s 4 of them in the span of 2 minutes”"
Mario Kart Wii,I’d much rather the baby characters than the Mario skins
Mario Kart Wii,L
Mario Kart Wii,"Double Dash will always be my favorite. The game is so snappy, the kart suspension and bounce gives a really smooth and authentic feel as well as creating a bit of chaos, the colors and textures are vibrant and sharp, the drift is so smooth, mini turbo really feels like a boost, the slidy wall impact mechanic makes for a smoother experience, character-unique items were an awesome touch, almost all tracks are bangers. Such a legendary game"
Mario Kart Wii,🍄🏎️💨
Mario Kart Wii,u dont need a modded wii to use online i was able to do it a week ago without modding my wii
Mario Kart Wii,i think karts should have had the ds styled miniturbos while the bikes have the new drift style but also have wheelies
Mario Kart Wii,I honestly feel like Mario Kart Wii was the most difficult Mario Kart. Mario Kart DS and 8 are so much easier imo.
Mario Kart Wii,"The ""terrible"" item balancing is exactly why so many people have such fond memories of MK Wii. Sure, it's frustrating if you're trying to 100% the game (which still isn't THAT hard), but when you're with friends it's hilarious. It's also what makes the game so appealing to players of all skill levels, where a tryhard can get taken down a peg while a newcomer wins it all."
Mario Kart Wii,Unpopular opinion: this is my least favorite 3D Mario Kart game.
Mario Kart Wii,"You don't lose points for losing balloons? I don't know what you did differently from me, but I always lose a point for losing all my balloons. Of course, if you personally don't have any points, you can't lose any, just like in the example you showed. That point of criticism isn't valid, because it's not true, sorry."
Mario Kart Wii,When I was a kid I had Mario Kart 8 on the Wii U. However my cousins had a Wii with Mario Kart Wii so I got to play it and I was surprised that it had some of the same tracks just different themes.
Mario Kart Wii,"To just play online you don’t have to do any modding, just typing in some settings in the Wi-Fi settings. Ctgp does require modding but it’s still nothing crazy"
Mario Kart Wii,14:00 Have you even tried the GCN Rainbow Road?
Mario Kart Wii,Dude have you played a modern Pokémon game? Gen 3 kidders have literally fit all the modern feature into games now. GF is such a lazy studio I genuinely prefer ROM HACKS over official releases
Mario Kart Wii,Bro get good
Mario Kart Wii,"I think that there is a difference in expectations that the game has to offer. There are really only 11 vehicles that are worth playing (Mach, dolphin, sneakster, quacker, bullet bike, magikruiser, flare runner, spear, jet bubble, wild wing, and flame flyer) all of those have fairly distinct ways that they play. Bullet bike, Mach bike, flare runner are very similar bikes that you can access from any weight class. Magikruiser and dolphin dasher have really good off-road stats and are particularly adept on races with light off-road like beach races, dk mountains, and sherbet land. Weight is a very exaggerated stat in Mario kart wii, so the ability to not rely on wheelies, charge to orange mini turbo, and be able to come out ahead on collisions was a strength of the flame flyer and the wild wing."
Mario Kart Wii,ngl this video has an unbelievable amount of hottakes :/
Mario Kart Wii,The donkey kong texture bug from wii is also present in double dash
Mario Kart Wii,this video was so funny
Mario Kart Wii,Skill Issue the video
Mario Kart Wii,18:16 To be fair. That person had no Points.
Mario Kart Wii,For me personally the biggest problem with Mario Kart Wii is the weight. You can just get hit by a red and then a random player launches you with 1000km/h against the next wall
Mario Kart Wii,"what's up with the mic quality, sounds like you're talking through  a cloth sometimes"
Mario Kart Wii,"I got powed and shook at the wrong time, blued redded, and fell in a tiny gap on maple treeway (wii)"
Mario Kart Wii,The game where there's a character combo that just wins over everything should be forgotten. Death to meta!
Mario Kart Wii,17:40 you can see him lose a point tho
Mario Kart Wii,"8:00 here i noticed, you sound like you have smoke in your throat. Like you take a hit from a shisha or vape and then talk and it gets this dampened sound. it stops sounding like that a minute later, but it returns a few times."
Mario Kart Wii,"Good review, better take than mk7 😭"
Mario Kart Wii,"I never saw any rubber banding in Wii, and saw it as much more prevalent in previous entries. SMK, 64, and DS have much worse rubber banding from what I've seen. The issue of the pack being too tight is an issue, however. The battle mode is underwhelming, yes. I would say the roster in Wii is probably one of the best, considering 8's has several clone characters that no one asked for, while Wii's only issue is Baby Daisy and as mentioned, the character stats. Wii also has some of the best tracks in the series, as mentioned."
Mario Kart Wii,"17:45 OK, THAT'S not true, look at your footage. The SECOND you got hit with your last Balloon, your team lost a point!!"
Mario Kart Wii,6:36 actually once you unlock the ability to put any character in any kart it becomes plain to see that the stats are all in the karts and the characters are only distinguished by weight class
Mario Kart Wii,"Mariokart Wii was my first. Once I realized (with emulators) that I didn’t need gyro to steer, I loved it. After that I played through mk7 which was awesome. I loved like all of them and playing it on the bus with tons of friends. Mk8 felt like a downgrade but once the deluxe fixed the problem of holding an item and getting another, that became the best. But I miss coconut mall which was in Wii and 7"
Mario Kart Wii,I’ve always felt like everything on Mario Kart Wii looked like it was made of plastic
Mario Kart Wii,Once I realised you could steer with the joystick on a nunchuck the game wasn't so bad anymore. Motion controls are garbage.
Mario Kart Wii,Skill issue
Mario Kart Wii,Actually if you loose all of your balloons you team looses a point so say you had 2 point now you are at 1 soooo yea that is wrong but I get where you are coming from
Mario Kart Wii,'Hard to talk about the WiFi'?
Mario Kart Wii,you lose 1point from the total points wjen you lose all your balloons!
Mario Kart Wii,Watching wario turn on maximum overdrive at 12:28 is RIDICULOUSLY FUNNY
Mario Kart Wii,Definitely agree with the blue shell comment. I remember getting blue shelled THIRTEEN times on Bowser Castle 3 and coming second after the final one hit me before the finish line
Mario Kart Wii,I'm not gonna lie mario kart wii is a great game but it's really overrated.
Mario Kart Wii,"I know people talk about “nostalgia blindness”, but wouldn’t there also be “new game renders old game obsolete… blindness” too?"
Mario Kart Wii,24:22 the third demographic is speedrunners
Mario Kart Wii,What's the difference between inside and outside drifting bikes?
Mario Kart Wii,"Can you make a video on Tour? I've never played it, so I'd be interested in hearing about it."
Mario Kart Wii,"I agree with you that there is a balancing problem with this game, (I mean fans have created this game from the ground up in order to make it more balanced) however I don't believe that the way mario kart 8 tried to balance it is the solution. This is because 8s way of balancing bikes was to strip them of there originality. You can no longer wheelie and inside drift, a fun addition from wii that could have been balanced to be more fair, was dumped for this weird feeling hybrid drift which made karts the better pick. So instead of trying to fix the problem, they just avoided it which wasn't a smart move, and the reason why some fans still play wii over 8"
Mario Kart Wii,"I agree with you that the drifting change was a spit in the face to series veterans and made bikes a better pick, however I feel like it wasn't as bad as people made it out to be. It was because of this we got advanced techniques like speed preservation and delayed drifting which made competitive wii feel more unique than most other mario kart games"
Mario Kart Wii,"As someone who grew up with wii here is my personal opinion on this video. When it comes to the items I agree with you. I find the shake dodge terrible and mega mushroom to be a worst star. However with the thundercloud, if it wasn't for the immediate activation it could have been a good item. You get it around 4th or 5th place which motivates you to hit people who are about to take top 3, messing up the top racers and giving racers at the back to catch up. I  agree with your point that the blooper but I feel like its not that effective in wii because the ink would be more efficient if it clouded one area on the screen because in wii you can still see the track"
Mario Kart Wii,"Imagine this: you get three stars on every 200, 150, 100 and 50cc on all of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe’s Booster Course Pass cups.
The game, as usual, sends you back to the title screen. You start up a new race…. and there he is; in all his groovy glory: _Funky Kong_

There honestly would not be a better reward for 100%ing the DLC cups than him."
Mario Kart Wii,"I actually just love the physics engine for MKWii. I love 8 and 8 Deluxe but Wii’s physics engine is just in a tier of its own imho. There’s just something about the crazy jumps, camera angles, and tricks in MKWii that makes it so much more fun than any other MK game. I mean 8 and 8D are fun but I still far prefer Wii’s physics. And the half pipes or whatever they’re called (the blue ramps) that you can just go up and jump into the air with were a lot of fun imo. I hope they make a game that has very similar physics to this game one day."
Mario Kart Wii,This is crazy I’m about to buy a Wii thanks for the review I’m still considering buying this game for my kid
Mario Kart Wii,"""Mario Kart seems to have this unspoken rule where if an item is in two consecutive titles, it then becomes a mainstay.""
Rip fake item box 😔"
Mario Kart Wii,"I gave no intention to be mean, but I'm halfway through the video and it just sounds like you need to get better, really no intention of shitting on you"
Mario Kart Wii,Wii was way better from an itemmanagement position because it gives items based on which place you are and not distance to leader. Its realy easy to build a huge lead in mkwii and only have to bother about 2-3 blues.
Mario Kart Wii,Are you really going to sit there with a straight face and tell me that Mario Kart Super Circuit has better handling than Mario Kart 64?
Mario Kart Wii,Thanks for this review!
Mario Kart Wii,As a casual Mario Kart gamer I loved this game! It plays great and looks spectacular for a Wii game!
Mario Kart Wii,"Even though it’s one of my favorite Mario kart Some of his complaints do make sense. I thing the game being very chaotic and hard is fun, like the old Mario party games. This could be bias though because I grew up on this game and double dash."
Mario Kart Wii,I remember one time me and my brother were playing this game and he got hit by like 2 or three blue shells in the span of 5 seconds
Mario Kart Wii,"Excellent review. I am really bothered by people who are diehard fans of this game. I have a really similar experience to yours. Years ago, I 100%'d this game and also never vowed to do it again. I probably spent thousands upon thousands of hours on this game. Looking back on it, it leaves a sour taste in my mouth, and I don't quite have a wish to play it again from scratch. It's such a massively unbalanced mess. I think snaking and all that does not even come close to how unbalanced and chaotic this game is."
Mario Kart Wii,You deserve way more subs than you have like the quality is so good
Mario Kart Wii,"Hey Gaming Pastime, you didn't review Mario Kart 7 on the 3DS?"
Mario Kart Wii,best Mario Kart game ever.
Mario Kart Wii,whats the best fishing game
Mario Kart Wii,This Was a Great Review Bro I Never Enjoyed Someone Mario Cart Reviews Tell You Thank You For Working Hard On These.
Mario Kart Wii,What's your opinion on the balancing of the game?
Mario Kart Wii,"I don’t remember having that much difficulty or frustration getting 3 stars in every cup and every difficulty, but it has been a while since I’ve played this one."
Mario Kart Wii,"Can you imagine if they kept snaking in a game with motion controls? Yeah that totally wouldn't result in people getting RSI, not to mention look incredibly stupid lmao."
Mario Kart Wii,">MK wii is all luck no skill!!!
Luck IS a skill you scrub, gitgud."
Mario Kart Wii,Mario Kart Wii is by far unfair and cheap i remember the Cup with Maple Tree on 150cc and wanted to rip my hair out. But its still my favorite Mario Kart just because I love the Handling and the tracks. Have you reviewed CTR PS1? Love to watch it your reviews are so honest so awesome.
Mario Kart Wii,I loved the maps in this game but could not stand the fucking slippery controls.
Mario Kart Wii,wow your voice sounds almost like geoff keyglee from game trailers.
Mario Kart Wii,I basically got rid of my wii because of how bullshit this game was. Thank you for articulating what I could not put into words back in college.
Mario Kart Wii,A very fair review. But wait till the butthurt mkwii competitive players watch this lol.
Mario Kart Wii,I recently realized the last game I played on my wii for years was MK in 2014 to catch the online servers one last time
Mario Kart Wii,"I really love this game I think the music in this game is just up there with Mario Kart 8's, it became the #1 selling Mario Kart game way before Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and the courses are the most creative, Coconut Mall being the huge example but what really makes this game the best is the community I just been playing a lot Mario Kart Wii CTGP Revolution where you can play online today with so many custom courses to race on and it's a lot of fun! True the item balance may be all over the place but I feel like that is what make this game fun and think this game is the KING of Mario Kart because it's still alive today thanks to the community!"
Mario Kart Wii,😎👍
Mario Kart Wii,Hell hath no fury like Gaming Pastime having to put up with Mario Kart's BS
Mario Kart Wii,"""Mario Kart 64 plays like shit"". Are we gonna shit on MK64 too these days? N64 badly aged games blablablabla. Next video..."
Mario Kart Wii,Did you describe snaking or did I completely miss that?
Mario Kart Wii,"MK scene have custom servers for Online Multiplayer with Wiimmfi, you need to patch the MK .iso and can be played on a modded console or with the dolphin emulator and it's just like the original experience, there's some guides online on how to set it up, also there's many games that can use Wiimmfi to play online and some of them still have couple of hundreds of players online everyday, MK has around 200 players online on average everyday"
Mario Kart Wii,"11:04 - 11.19
That had no right to be hilarious. 🤣"
Mario Kart Wii,Way to shit on people's nostalgia.
Mario Kart Wii,Hey! There are some catchy tracks. Wario's Gold Mine? Toad's Workshop? Koopa Cape? Bowser's Castle? Rainbow Road?
Mario Kart Wii,This is the Mario Kart I played the most
Mario Kart Wii,The one thing I disagree with You on this review is the music. I love this soundtrack
Mario Kart Wii,"Believe it or not, I'm one of the few people who always used automatic drifting."
Mario Kart Wii,What I don’t like is why they changed the structure of Balloon Battle and why its teams only.
Mario Kart Wii,"Believe it or not, this was my second favorite Mario Kart game behind Double Dash and would always play this with a Wii classic controller because I couldn't stand motion controls."
Mario Kart Wii,I still play it for this day
Mario Kart Wii,How does your game look so good?
Mario Kart Wii,"Mariokart wii was perfect cos of how unique the maps were, and how the game in general simply needed skill to be gd at. I've seen my siblings u can't play mariokart wii for shit cos they keep falling off, clear mariokart deluxe stages with some random ass power up they got, they literally can't die in the game. Any game that does not require much skill can't beat the thrill mariokart wii gave me when I was still invested in it"
Mario Kart Wii,literally the only problem i had with this game was half the battle courses were too big. I liked there ideas but too big for the amount of players that could play in a lobby
Mario Kart Wii,the nostaliga man ....... that game was my first even one and it was perfecttttttt
Mario Kart Wii,"This Game was perfect in every way, but what made it the PERFECT Mario Kart is the time it was launched, most of us were kids, and being able to play against our family, when they came home we challenges them and it was so fun, and the multiplayer was the GOAT"
Mario Kart Wii,I use a numbchuck
Mario Kart Wii,I’ve used the Wii wheel every game in mkwii
Mario Kart Wii,"The unfair, stressful, and hectic moments when your next to the finish and you see on your friends screen a blue shell and you start yelling, cursing, and trying to get to the finish before it gets you is what makes this game so great. It’s those moments that bring me back to this wonderful game. The maps are just so good too."
Mario Kart Wii,"when I have kids, I'm having them experience the wii for themselves so they can know the gaming titan I and many others here grew up with. they shall feel the magic of mk wii."
Mario Kart Wii,Mario Kart wii sucks just like this video
Mario Kart Wii,the answer to your question is Funky Kong
Mario Kart Wii,"MKWii was almost some of the best MK games, but the unbalanced items and (in my opinion) the existence of the baby characters kinda ruin it for me"
Mario Kart Wii,I played it once and I didnt like it probably cause I was like 8 years old and always fell down on that mushroom track I wonder though what it would be like nowadays could maybe change my mind
Mario Kart Wii,"For me when i was in primary school we had these things called games day wear we had a whole day of bringing in ds, laptops amoung other things and we all turned our volume up to max to here the starting music and 123 GO! to the point whole school heard it hahahahah😂😂😂 brilliant memeories"
Mario Kart Wii,"I feel like this game hit the sweet spot in terms of complexity, all the mario kart games after this felt like they added too much just for the sake of change."
Mario Kart Wii,The only bad thing about mario kart Wii is the battle mode. I still played battle mode a ton but I didn't know about any of the older battlemodes at the time.
Mario Kart Wii,Do you think this guy watched Jschlatts video 🤔🤔🤔
Mario Kart Wii,"Fuck ""actual hardware"""
Mario Kart Wii,didnt even mention the GOATED coin and balloon games🧏🏻‍♀️😔
Mario Kart Wii,"Bro, I literally play Mario Kart Wii since 2011 and didn't know about that shortcut at 6:50, crazy man. I love this game"
Mario Kart Wii,Wii was cool but Double Dash is still the most unique Mario Kart title and I don't understand why Nintendo hasn't incorporated more of the elements of that game into later console iterations..
Mario Kart Wii,The controls are shit
Mario Kart Wii,I remember playing time trials and purposely going slow one lap to beat myself the next.
Mario Kart Wii,The battle mode is unparalleled
Mario Kart Wii,I agree with you when you say Moonview Highway is AMAZING
Mario Kart Wii,"This was also was my first Mario Kart I've ever played 
I remember when I used to play it during afterschool club it was SO nostalgic"
Mario Kart Wii,Mariokart 7 has the best tracks. Not a single bad one.
Mario Kart Wii,Double dash is the best one in the series
Mario Kart Wii,"Watching this as a 30 year old who has only ever played Mario Cart 64 growing up, and then Mario Cart 8 with my kids... I wasn't even aware of this games existence 😅"
Mario Kart Wii,This one is just my favorite because of all the good times I had playing it with my sister
Mario Kart Wii,I wanna cry because I will used to play this dam game every day
Mario Kart Wii,Nice video
Mario Kart Wii,"100% most nostalgic for the credits. Man, unlocking dry bowser was so rewarding when I was younger and whenever I hear it I am transported bak to that moment. Perfect vid."
Mario Kart Wii,thanks for the video love coconut mall too keep it up
Mario Kart Wii,MKwii will never die. like melee
Mario Kart Wii,mk wii and smash melee are very similar philosophies
Mario Kart Wii,This is the WORST Mario Kart. Crappy super wide tracks to make up for the waggle controls. Overpowered bikes. Horrible music. Trash levels
Mario Kart Wii,9:43 had me absolutely dying 😂😂
Mario Kart Wii,"I always thought MKWii sucked until I played the game online. The single-player on that game is absolutely, atrociously rigged and chaotic, and the online is so much fun. It’s a polar opposite from MK8"
Mario Kart Wii,ROSALINA IS THE REASON
Mario Kart Wii,"Until after Mario Kart 7, when you fall off you never know where you’re going to respawn which is what made it fun but the makers of Mario Kart 8 somehow had to insist you be picked up instantly as if you broke down."
Mario Kart Wii,"When someone tells me to ""get good"" at mario kart wii i tell them ""to get better at what luck"
Mario Kart Wii,Mario kart wii is luck based
Mario Kart Wii,I am the Princess! ❤❤
Mario Kart Wii,i will always be biased toward my boy double dash tho
Mario Kart Wii,Double dash is better and feels faster
Mario Kart Wii,U forgot about us nunchuck users😂
Mario Kart Wii,"Bro an italian copied your video
https://youtu.be/7bLMrdvG_3g"
Mario Kart Wii,Coconut mall is what made it perfect
Mario Kart Wii,Was just watching a video to get coconut malled intentionally 🫡
Mario Kart Wii,"I finally want a new Mario Kart. Mario Kart Wii was awesome, Mario Kart 8 was cool, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe was nothing new and now I have been playing the same shit for 9 fucking years. I have been playing Mario Kart 8 for NINE years.

I finally want something new"
Mario Kart Wii,Aboot
Mario Kart Wii,I was so good at this game I would be first place 95% of the time. Even playing online against Japanese players. I had every turn and move memorized! I wish I would have played competitively because I honestly had a shot of being really good at it.
Mario Kart Wii,WAIT PLEASE TELL ME HOW YOU GET INTO THE ONLINE PLAYING IN MARIO CART WII?!
Mario Kart Wii,Double Dash better bro
Mario Kart Wii,Me and my family have a wii And Mario kart it’s the best game
Mario Kart Wii,Amazing video! Really captured the feeling a lot of long time Mario Kart veterans feel about the game and Wii's era. There's so many moments I still remember with this game to this day 15 years later! I started playing around 64 and Double Dash but Wii holds a very special place in my heart for all the nights and days I spent online. I feel like Wii is comparable to Melee from SSB in the sense that the community and game long outlasts any others. One thing I will say is that technically Mario Kart DS had online first but this game is the first to bring it to consoles!
Mario Kart Wii,8 already has better courses lol
Mario Kart Wii,The time it was out was just perfect I believe that Mario kart wii is the best ever game and humanity is lucky to have been given this!
Mario Kart Wii,9:46 lol yeah im guilty. The game would lockup and freeze the wii if you spammed too many of the same items. Fun times. Also best finiahing music too imo
Mario Kart Wii,Ok let me tell you how it really was perfect. Everything Mario kart 8 didn't do
Mario Kart Wii,12:42 Got me In My Feels :(
Mario Kart Wii,This was the first Wii game I’ve ever played
Mario Kart Wii,mari kart physics for the win
Mario Kart Wii,"I just found my Wii and my MarioKart. I never got around to getting all the tracks and cups. Now, I’m on the MarioKart grind and I’m almost done. Great video by the way I was laughing so much."
Mario Kart Wii,"Got this Game when I was 11 (in May 2008). Whilst 8 is my favourite, I think Mario Kart Wii has the best selection of original tracks!"
Mario Kart Wii,When I was little I thought that Mario was a racing franchise because this was the only Mario game I had until I saved up enough allowance money for Galaxy. I played enough of MKWii that the blooper basically did nothing.
Mario Kart Wii,I use tilt controlls
Mario Kart Wii,200cc with auto-steer vs bots makes me feel so powerful and I will never change that
Mario Kart Wii,I wish I would be able to play online TvT
Mario Kart Wii,"That game was my childhood. I was always Yoshi with a motorcycle, my sister was always Daisy with a car, my dad was always his wii avatar with a car, and my mom was always either peach or her wii avatar with a car"
Mario Kart Wii,"0:20, I've never thought about doing this lol. The fact that Mario is a baby makes it even cuter."
Mario Kart Wii,For me MKWii was one of the weaker games. The race is almost random due to item overflow
Mario Kart Wii,When you hit a wall…you stop
Mario Kart Wii,Mario Kart Wii is in my opinion the best mario kart game
Mario Kart Wii,funky kong😊
Mario Kart Wii,"I actually only saw a hacker online for Mario Kart Wii once, and it was me testing if cheats worked online lol. Mario Kart DS however had about 1 in every 10 players hacking online lmao. 

Mario Kart DS was the first Nintendo and Mario Kart game with online by the way. Also it wasn't Nintendo who shut down the online but rather Game Spy (RIP)."
Mario Kart Wii,"Perfect thing about it is that it is similar to CTR, you can actually be good at it like I was and it pays off, no one can catch eith you. I beat the track record for rainbow road by 20 seconds and felt proud about it."
Mario Kart Wii,Been playing Mario kart ds and watching this made me remember how good the game looked when it came out on Wii I remember being in awe
Mario Kart Wii,I love Mario kart 8 deluxe and super smash bros ultimate on my switch oled so much and handheld is better
Mario Kart Wii,It's the best Mario Kart because it has the best Rainbow Road
Mario Kart Wii,My introduction to the Mario kart series was mario kart 7
Mario Kart Wii,It’s amazing how the most fun multiplayer games out there are unbalanced
Mario Kart Wii,The graphics are the best
Mario Kart Wii,10:17 i was an AVID mario kart wii player back in my childhood and i played online races all the time. i will never forget the first time i encountered a hacker. i remember taking a video of my tv screen with a camcorder because of how bewildered i was lmaooooo. good times
Mario Kart Wii,"This game actually had you complete challenges to unlock everything, the later mario karts just have you collecting coins which was boring and less engaging, and made the unlocks feel less special than when accomplishing different challenges"
Mario Kart Wii,best mario kart game ever
Mario Kart Wii,I wish I still had my wii 😢 so I can play Mario kart wii. It’s also almost the almost exactly the same age as me I was born April 9th 2008
Mario Kart Wii,"i remember my brother and i were always playing when we were around 10 at the time and we were always freaking out and having an uproar of excitement when we always joined a lobby with hackers, that game was a core memory of my childhood"
Mario Kart Wii,The one thing that kept mario Kart wii from being the best mario Kart is that it is probably a little too chaotic because we all know the keep getting hit memes
Mario Kart Wii,"Huge skill ceiling. Wheelies, tricks, mini tricks, inside/outside drift, half pipes. aghHHH I love this game"
Mario Kart Wii,Dude has never played Double Dash smh (moon view highway is groundbreaking?)
Mario Kart Wii,"I legit just got back into my reminiscing phase, and the first game to hit my nostalgia hard was Mario Kart Wii. The first video that popped up was Moonview Highway, my favorite racetrack and soundtrack of all time. So many memories were made with that game, to the point where my ringtone is the options menu music. I still have my Wii, but Mario Kart does not work anymore, the disk is unfortunately scratched. But now knowing that there’s people who are still active and it’s on my servers, and determined to keep it alive, going as far as to keeping the online experience alive and creating new tracks and characters to expand your experience with the game, it’s something romantic about it. Pardon me as I go do some engineering for my Wii, because my Mario Kart Wii career is not over yet, the bittersweet feeling that my younger self felt will not be in vain. Here I come custom Mii, we’re about to hit the track one more time…"
Mario Kart Wii,nostalgia
Mario Kart Wii,MKWii requires more skill than MK8 & is therefore more fun.
Mario Kart Wii,Mario Kart Wii is the best game i ever played in my life. I love mario kart 8 deluxe but it just doesnt give off the same vibe as mario kart wii. My childhood revolved around this very game. Thousands of hours were poured in just to unlock everything and have a fun time. I wonder if i will ever have the same experience again…
Mario Kart Wii,I'm saddened by the fact that I never played this game on the wii. We had the ds version and that's what we stuck with back in the day. I just bought mk8 deluxe a week ago and I have once again discovered how much I love this game.
Mario Kart Wii,Actually Mario Kart DS was the first game in the series to have online multiplayer
Mario Kart Wii,"wii luigi and wii mario circuit are probably the worst circuit tracks in the franchise 
the cpu's are staff ghost are just not hard enough
battle mode could be better
wii wheel is actually uncontrollable
the pow block and thundercloud are a bit weird
you love toad's' factory but you smash into the wall near the lake every time
and why peach standard bike, it's so bad
bikes can be inside and outside drift, but the game doesn't tell you which from the menus
ssmt exist, which break acceleration
everyone online uses funky flame

I still like the game though"
Mario Kart Wii,That was amazing.
Mario Kart Wii,"Worldwide, reeeegional"
Mario Kart Wii,Damm this video is hilarious considering it’s 14 years ago 😂
Mario Kart Wii,"Lines from this review pop into my head all the time and make me smile, and my friends and I still throw out quotes from it every once in a while when we get together all these years later. Thank you so much for all of the laughs"
Mario Kart Wii,1:18 that's me when I prefer playing with a nunshuck or gamecube controller lol
Mario Kart Wii,This is awesome 😂😂
Mario Kart Wii,goated vid
Mario Kart Wii,"This is one of my favorite reviews of this game, mostly because -it's a hilarious parody of the ""angry game review"" genre, poor research, nitpicks, and all, and of course reading all the people who took the bait is the cherry on top of this sundae- absolutely, positively 100% factually correct."
Mario Kart Wii,sadly they did indeed get lazy with the smash bros names
Mario Kart Wii,criminy
Mario Kart Wii,"IGSRJ is so unhinged all throughout this damn video. I love the enthusiasm, and especially the part with Sam. Get owned, Sam."
Mario Kart Wii,0:33 didn't age well with the 3DS/Wii U Smash Bros game lol
Mario Kart Wii,"IGSRJ: gives hate to the game

Me: enjoyed the review and enjoyed the game. 🤣

Also me: I still don't use Funky Kong so I'm cool."
Mario Kart Wii,This video seriously one of my all time favorites on this site. I'll come back to this video once every few months to hear this text to speech voice get irate and it never fails to amuse me a decade later.
Mario Kart Wii,WHAT IS THIS VIDEO WHY I HAVEN'T SEEN IT BEFORE OMG
Mario Kart Wii,masterpiece.
Mario Kart Wii,"0:09 No, it was released on the NES, not the N64."
Mario Kart Wii,0:31 don't tell him about smash 4...
Mario Kart Wii,"In Wario's Gold Mine, he keeps going straight up. In rainbow road automatic outside drifters are the worst combo"
Mario Kart Wii,I wonder if Sam ever actually found and watched this video...
Mario Kart Wii,Please whoever is “Sam”  say hey
Mario Kart Wii,Oh on the N64 lol
Mario Kart Wii,Released on the Nintendo 64 lol
Mario Kart Wii,But If you have a big family ! Your fucked.

Mario Kart Wii,The first Mario kart game was NOT for the n64
Mario Kart Wii,Ok I get this is a joke and it's bloody hilarious but 90% of my life was spent playin this so chill.
Mario Kart Wii,"that Kurtcobain mii should’ve had a lime green shirt, not yellow, cause in the ‘smells like teen spirit’ music video, he’s clearly wearing a lime green shirt, not yellow, they even give that color option in the mii plaza, but this fucker decides to make him yellow... fucking pathetic... says it in the voice he uses 😂"
Mario Kart Wii,LOSE POINTS FOR DISCONNECTION YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT IT IT'S NOT FAIR IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT

Mario Kart Wii,That's the Dave voice from GoAnimate.
Mario Kart Wii,"Ah, back when everybody's VR was 5000..."

Mario Kart Wii,when did the mario kart ds come out?
Mario Kart Wii,is mario kart still online?
Mario Kart Wii,Despite that you didn't like the game I liked your vid.
Mario Kart Wii,Hey IGSRJ go fuck yourself (if this is a prank or troll then sorry...)
Mario Kart Wii,Super Mario Kart was for SNES not N64.
Mario Kart Wii,This is a perfect example of how someone gets triggered while playing Mario Kart (I know that this is a troll because this game is very popular)
Mario Kart Wii,Almost 9 years later this guy is a legend
Mario Kart Wii,this made me laugh so hard
Mario Kart Wii,well funny IGSRJ
Mario Kart Wii,"No Offence IGSRJ, But The first super mario game wasn't made for N64 I, Myself Also doesn't know BUT Listen to this word.







-> Mario Kart 64 <- 




Do you see the word 64 in the word?"
Mario Kart Wii,I very much enjoyed this. This video made me laugh in 2016. My buddies and I still play this game because the balancing issues in this game are ridiculous.
Mario Kart Wii,so many curse words i remember watching this when i was a kid and didn't understand them

Mario Kart Wii,"Rainbow Road is actually my favourite track because once you become good at it, you feel good about it. I, obviously, have become good at it."

Wii Sports Resort,haha if this was he would male no sense u can buy the black wii but they did not have it then i love this game i just wish they made wii sports again im 15 and when the game came out i was 7 i was playing most of my life
Wii Sports Resort,"You can on your Wii if you go into Wii settings, screen and you can change graphics in tv type from 50hz (576i) or 60hz (480i) 60hz is terrible graphics and 50hz is hd graphics. Also you can change screen from widescreen (16:9) to standard (4:3) which 16:9 is wise the wide screen and 4:3 is when everything is wide. If you know about that, it's alright."
Wii Sports Resort,"I actually got this with my other Wii at my dad's house. I got it with the baseball bat, tennis bat, wheel (the weird none Mario Kart Wii one), the golf 
club, motion plus device. So yeah, I love this game! But the one thing, and yes I actually HATE ONE THING ABOUT IT and that is the annoying Wii motion plus at the beginning that you have to watch if you haven't played in a while! You can't skip it! It's all like oh we know you know how this works, but in case if you don't understand because we totally think your dumb. It can't even be skipped! I'm all like ok I know how to use the motion plus thing, so shut up!"
Wii Sports Resort,I played island flyer for hours when I was younger
Wii Sports Resort,"i would skydive

Wii Sports Resort,Every min on that basketball court was white. Now THAT is very uncommon
Wii Sports Resort,I enjoyed this game a lot when I was younger :)
Wii Sports Resort,this was an amazing game it was my childhood.
Wii Sports Resort,You dont need the wii motion thing i dont use it and im fine
Wii Sports Resort,"Table tennis is easily my favourite mode in this game. You could pull off a lot of cool shots and you really need to us tactics in the higher levels. Free flying was awesome aswell. Loved flying through every narrow passage there was.
What really annoys me and surprises me, is the disc golf mode. I didn't know about that one until now. I really want to play it."
Wii Sports Resort,"This is the best game ever.
Im going to rewiew this and many other games on my channel so check me out if you want to :D"
Wii Sports Resort,I haven't played this yet -- about to get it.. The airplane one reminds me of Pilot Wings. Still sad that they never released an updated PW for wii ... Here's to hoping they do so on Wii U -- It would give me yet another reason to buy the console.
Wii Sports Resort,Wait you have to plug something into the Wii note to get motion plus I thought it was built in and that's why remotes say motion plus inside
Wii Sports Resort,I remember playing these games at a library event in the kids section years ago. I'm surprised I remembered it.
Wii Sports Resort,I like your voice. It's unique.
Wii Sports Resort,You are awesome
Wii Sports Resort,"The 100 pin strike is pretty easy. My greatest achievement on this game is finding all 80 spots on the island flyover. If you find them all, you get your own cottage. "
Wii Sports Resort,Donde uno lo quonsuge ??
Wii Sports Resort,"I don't blame you on archery! That game was fantastic! I loved bowling just as much too. Seriously whenever me and my brothers/relative came over for a weekend or something, they brought their Wii and we just played a TON of bowling, archery, or frisbee."
Wii Sports Resort,"2:20 The only thing I didn't like about Archery is that I had to use the wii remote on my left hand and the nunchuk on the other. I didn't have trouble, I just wasn't use to my left hand holding a Wii remote. "
Wii Sports Resort,"You said how Dogfight and Island Flyover use the map...

It's Wuhu and Wedge Island. All of the sports are located there except Classic Golf."
Wii Sports Resort,canoeing is hard 
Wii Sports Resort,Nice strike the closest I got to 100 was 99 and the last pin was tilting like the Eiffel Tower and the game didn't count it
Wii Sports Resort,2 thumbs up for 100 pin strike! I luv u! I have seen ALL your videos
Wii Sports Resort,B t w I have 2 black wii motes. 1wii  mote. 2 wii mote plus
Wii Sports Resort, On utube go to tricks on wii sports resort one of them is on bowling d-pad up is blue left is red down is green and right is golden. B t w 
Wii Sports Resort,As u called that your greatest accomplishment I assume u have not worked out the secret strike (which is also in the training mode of wii sports)
Wii Sports Resort,What a great review.  Thanks!
Wii Sports Resort,And you don't actually use the Nunchuk for Canoeing.
Wii Sports Resort,"Actually, I got my Wii Sports Resort for $16 or so along with two Wii MotionPlusses around $8 each at GameStop. $50, you say? I think not."
Wii Sports Resort,"It's not really the crazy hands to make you win, it's about hitting the player because hitting the stick is what makes you lose your balance and get close to losing, just in case you didn't know."
Wii Sports Resort,I agree with Basketball. I liked just about every game..except basketball and canoeing. Ugghhhh....
Wii Sports Resort,Bee farm?
Wii Sports Resort,That was the only true bad thing about the game to me.
Wii Sports Resort, I don't think you need too. 
Wii Sports Resort,Cool
Wii Sports Resort,cool game 
Wii Sports Resort,"moha
"
Wii Sports Resort,"shit up
"
Wii Sports Resort,Does anyone else think wakeboarding would be cool if you could use the nunchuck to steer and the wii remote to do tricks? Or to use the balance board and have the tricks done automatically? 
Wii Sports Resort,"Thumbs up if you don't own this game!!
"
Wii Sports Resort,They put this in Mario Kart 7 as a track
Wii Sports Resort,"If you play enough 1 on 1 swordplay, it does get to a point where randomly flailing doesn't work"
Wii Sports Resort,he complain alot
Wii Sports Resort,"Yeah right, because learning stuff for the real world is so overrated.
Why go to school at all?  Morons unite!"
Wii Sports Resort,wii party comeing soon
Wii Sports Resort,sky diving is the first game you have to play

Wii Sports Resort,I miss this game. It had so much fun playing it! I'm gonna rent it again!!
Wii Sports Resort,2:14 nice shot :)
Wii Sports Resort,"2 things i hate about having a 3 story house
1      i really hate going up and down the stairs all the time

Wii Sports Resort,I love these reviews cause there TRUE
Wii Sports Resort,Love this game and I got it as a packin game
Wii Sports Resort,@superluigi9624 welp ; thats nintendo logic for ya
Wii Sports Resort,the paddleing game i played a couple times and i won and HEY 
Wii Sports Resort,Your review is spot on.
Wii Sports Resort,太次
Wii Sports Resort,1:28 really? winning spasms?
Wii Sports Resort,"I see why you hate canoeing, you're not doing it right, you need to use the paddle to turn"
Wii Sports Resort,"""Instead of swinging the remote wildly, you actually had to pay attention"" 
Nostalgia: that's not how it works"
Wii Sports Resort,i got every i point when i was 7 or 8 without looking up any of them
Wii Sports Resort,"I played wii sports resort all the time with my big brother,

I remember playing sword play a lot, And did anyone else make tall characters specifically because they were bad at basketball? (Idk if it even made a difference) I did enjoy the balloon vs game, And i never even knew island flyover existed :') if only i could've got to explore more.

Wuhu island is honestly a magical place, I would pretend that i lived there and played sports with all my mii friends! 

I don't have a wii anymore and i heard switch sports isn't very good, But atleast i can fondly look back on those times. And maybe save up for one!"
Wii Sports Resort,I just graduated High School last week and I was just thinking back on my memories of this game.  I used to play this with my siblings and cousins in my childhood. I was obsessed with this game in Kindergarten and I would pretend I was in the game at recess. One time I was too focused on pretending to be in the cycling game that I actually refused when another student asked me to play with them and they started crying. We all did things as kids we regret now. Now I just make fun of that moment every time I think of this game and I almost got emotional typing this comment🥲
Wii Sports Resort,"Ok my resort story
It was the first game I ever played and I loved it I played none stop and one thing I was insane at was table tennis I was the best at it infact I went on a streak and it's not gone my record has held for 5 years and is still going I started beating lucia 6-0 consistently
And everyone couldn't beat me 
My strat for basketball 
So against Tommy just do quick 3s it's super effective if you're accurate and you'll win all the time

Swordplay 
It was the first mode I played and it was special as you said showdown is so fun and I got all 20 levels and I was so excited 

Btw I got 2500 on 10 sports the only ones left are archery and wakeboarding 

Overall the greatest game of all time in my opinion the way it opened to the fun rewards you get for completing the champion and the incredible music the goat of games easily"
Wii Sports Resort,Golf is worse
Wii Sports Resort,"I never knew about the hidden targets until now, but it’s such a cool detail and fun to aim for."
Wii Sports Resort,I find it so weird that the CPU Miis turn around the other way to then grab a bowling ball.
Wii Sports Resort,19:56 one thing I think is pretty funny in cycling is when you see the odd pizza delivery bicycles taking part in the race
Wii Sports Resort,If they ever made a Nintendo switch version of this game at much like they did with the original Wii Sport that is an option ID like to see them include a free roam mode with no time limit for the water gliders and the flyover
Wii Sports Resort,Basketball's my favorite game on here.
Wii Sports Resort,the best game every made
Wii Sports Resort,"I still have it and I don’t care if nothing changes, but I always play it, it’s just too fun to not play"
Wii Sports Resort,the nostalgia 😍
Wii Sports Resort,The wii is the best console of all time hands down
Wii Sports Resort,This came out in 09??? Damn I feel old
Wii Sports Resort,Island flyover was my everything. Seriously my comfort game. I miss it so much. I’m considering buying the Wii again just to play this again. Brought me so much joy and comfort & was so therapeutic
Wii Sports Resort,My games on wii sports resort were 1. Table Tennis 2. Wakeboarding 3. Basketball (pick-up game) and 4. Power Cruising. I’m pro status in only Basketball

Wii Sports Resort,i remember my mom buying me one at 7 or 8 years old i was so happy.. gosh miss these days..
Wii Sports Resort,23:23 I feel like it’s both lol- regardless I love going upside down or doing loops
Wii Sports Resort,This game was the GOAT. If they made another version where you could live on this island and do stuff i would play the heck out of that. Kinda like a tomogachi life version on wuhu island
Wii Sports Resort,"THIS MUST BE JUST LIKE LIVING IN PARADISE

AND I DON'T WANNA GO HOME"
Wii Sports Resort,"One of my absolute favorite games. I spent so many hours on island flyover, to this day I think it’s the most fun I’ve ever had controlling a video game. This game means everything to my childhood, thanks for making a video on it. Just hearing the music gets me emotional."
Wii Sports Resort,funfact: there is a game called friend connection in wii party where you can test your friendship or relationship with your second player and the cpus with the highest score are Matt and Lucia
Wii Sports Resort,I got my will in 2022
Wii Sports Resort,"I find myself coming back to this video. It’s so comforting revisiting this nostalgic game. It’s literally my whole childhood. I’d spend hours playing this game with my family 😁 good times, that I miss…"
Wii Sports Resort,I played this game as a child and I loved it
Wii Sports Resort,I told my Dad about the secret strike and he NO JOKE did it after like 15 tries. THREE TIMES.
Wii Sports Resort,It's just a time limit dude..
Wii Sports Resort,when I beat the 20th sword level it was one of the best feelings ever
Wii Sports Resort,Island flyover is an S tier game mode!
Wii Sports Resort,"maaan i always had a used sports resort game. it was scratched and i could never play past round 2 of table tennis. i always wanted to go further, nice video!"
Wii Sports Resort,i remember when i was little i wanted to live on this island
Wii Sports Resort,I want Wii sports resort 😅
Wii Sports Resort,Matt is literally mace windu
Wii Sports Resort,Archery is underrated
Wii Sports Resort,I’m surprised wrestling wasn’t added in this
Wii Sports Resort,"I got Lucia but never beat her as well, but can’t stop playing it due to just the gameplay."
Wii Sports Resort,When is Nintendo gonna make Wii Sports Winter Resort?
Wii Sports Resort,my childhood 🥹🥹
Wii Sports Resort,Me crying for the whole video
Wii Sports Resort,I still remember never being able to beat my older brother on anything in this game so frustrating but when I look back I really do miss throwing the remote at his had while raging then running for dear life. the good ol day🥺😭
Wii Sports Resort,i'm proud to say i still have my wii and my wii sports and wii sports resort
Wii Sports Resort,"I love Wii Sports Resort! My brother and I used to play this game all the time! Feels like nostalgia every time we play this game today. Swordplay, Basketball, and Ping Pong are my favorites! In our household, these are classics on top of wakeboarding, frisbee dog, archery, Golf, and Bowling. I also love cycling, skydiving, and dogfight/island flightover. I am not a big fan of canoeing and Power Crusing, but I could not imagine Wii Sports Resort without these sports. My brother and I have both beat Lucia in Ping Pong.

Night time and sunset are my two favorite in game times to play.

I'll admit, I wish Wuhu Island was real! I bet many people would visit a real life Wuhu Island."
Wii Sports Resort,I have played archery for year's. I never knew about the secret targets until I watched your Wii Sports Resort Iceberg Video. 😂
Wii Sports Resort,Signing that petition would be the best decision I have EVER made.
Wii Sports Resort,Trust me if nintendo never make a new game about wuhu island I will do it I'm a game dev and one day I will have my giant studio
Wii Sports Resort,"5:16 At this map, I always tried to push the other miis down the bridge😂"
Wii Sports Resort,Playing this with my brothers all the time after school and on weekends was like the best time honestly. It's been years and now everyone has their own lives elsewhere. Nostalgia is a bitch.
Wii Sports Resort,"oh my god I didn’t ever realise that the crowd gets bigger in sword play, I’ve had my wii for 7 years and it was always my fav level to play 😯"
Wii Sports Resort,I remember having to attach that damned wii motion plus thing as a kid haha. Now the wii remotes already have it built in
Wii Sports Resort,"@Nintendo Hero I noticed that you missed one thing in your video. That one thing is when you boot up Wii sports for the first time on that console, it puts you right into skydiving then introduces you to the island from above."
Wii Sports Resort,I used to think a pick up game was a game of basketball you could just walk into the middle of and you'd be accepted into one of the two teams
Wii Sports Resort,"dammit, I am now realizing how much I missed when playing. I would've had so much fun 100%ing this game if I knew all this when I was younger"
Wii Sports Resort,"Wii Sports Resort has some of my best memories because it was the only game I didn't feel complete trash at(I was a god at wakeboarding, still am) so every time I open up my closet and find my Wii and Wii U, I feel the INSANE urge to set it up and play. If anyone who's played it before is with me at my house, you can bet I'm bringing it out. Anyone who's willing to go back in time to some of the best days of video games, we're doing it."
Wii Sports Resort,This is probably my favorite game of all time. I wish they would remake it 1 to 1 but with upgraded graphics and maybe new golf courses and stuff while leaving the mechanics exactly the same! I played this game practically every weekend for a decade!
Wii Sports Resort,"I’m foaming at the mouth to play this again. My Wii MotionPlus can’t get here soon enough. :(

Edit: my Wii MotionPlus did arrive and oh man, I CANNOT PUT THIS GAME DOWN. I LOVE Wii Sports Resort."
Wii Sports Resort,*wipes tears*
Wii Sports Resort,"Regarding Dogfight, you forgot to mention that if you collide into something by accident, you lose half your balloons; a balloon icon will grant you an extra 10 balloons. Max is 30."
Wii Sports Resort,"Table tenis has to be my favourite, probably more than 500 matches, today I got a 0-6 from Lucia 😂😂😂"
Wii Sports Resort,"This game was amazing. I miss it too much, and I desperately want a sequel for it."
Wii Sports Resort,I think this or mario kart wii was the 1st video game i've ever played.
Wii Sports Resort,with frisbee golf I often had my dad or sister somehow throw further then myself whilst using the same technique
Wii Sports Resort,good content
Wii Sports Resort,"I still play the bowling most days.
Switch Sports bowling *suuuuucks*"
Wii Sports Resort,Not trying to brag but I beat Lucia
Wii Sports Resort,Frisbee golf was my absolute favorite part of the game.  Even more than flyover.
Wii Sports Resort,"Of course everything talked about during the video makes the game amazing, but let's not forget the amazing soundtrack that makes WSR the most memorable game ever! All those little variations on a similar theme is part of what makes it so"
Wii Sports Resort,I wish there was a sequel to this game. I had the original Wii Sports to go along with this gem. I played these games for hours.
Wii Sports Resort,"On Table Tennis VS mode, if you hold down the 2 button when you press OK to play, you can play an 11-point game, as well as the time now being noon."
Wii Sports Resort,"Wii Sports Resort, and especially Island Flyover, is such an immaculate, beautiful vibe that makes me feel good every time I just think about it. I chase that type of vibe to this day."
Wii Sports Resort,I'd love for a remaster and expansion of Wii Sports Resort for the switch. This game was my childhood and I still love it to this day. Watching this video made me smile seeing all my favourite sports and having a wave of nostalgia flood over me. One of my favourite games of all time
Wii Sports Resort,"Ok sp I just pulled up the game of life 2 on the switch, and the classic board looks suspiciously like wuhu island"
Wii Sports Resort,"I swear to god, i will hold on to this opinion forever, graphics do not get “better” after the wii. They get more pixels, or more realistic shading, but they DO NOT get “better.”"
Wii Sports Resort,guys who here still plays wii sports resort? or just me
Wii Sports Resort,I wish Nintendo would make a wii sports resort island series
Wii Sports Resort,You  can move your players in pickup basketball.
Wii Sports Resort,Greatest sequel of all time
Wii Sports Resort,switch sports really got the announcer wrong
Wii Sports Resort,We need more people like you.
Wii Sports Resort,"This game had so much nostalgia for me. The childhood memories of my friend and I pretending to actually be on Wuhu island(which was not hard because of miis) is always something I love to think about. Those were some of the best days of my life. Not only is the game fun, the memories are my favorite part. I hope one day for a game where you can explore wuhu island without limits."
Wii Sports Resort,"25:58

Wii Sports Resort,Wii sports resort is a great game
Wii Sports Resort,Nintendo Switch Sports is out!!! But lacks all the games that made Resort great.
Wii Sports Resort,Matt's basketball team: George and Fritz.
Wii Sports Resort,when will they come up with this game for the switch?
Wii Sports Resort,my sister scratched the disc and i never played it again🥹
Wii Sports Resort,After all these years if still never played this game… I’ve only played the original.
Wii Sports Resort,My dad got a perfect game just by doing the secret strike in 100 pin bowling
Wii Sports Resort,Technically it would be the second best selling Wii game since the original was a launch title
Wii Sports Resort,This nostalgia makes me wanna cry😭I miss little kid me playing this amazing game ahead of its time🥹.
Wii Sports Resort,Tell me your entire childhood without telling me your entire childhood.
Wii Sports Resort,"Playing Wii sports resort with friends was just so fun and i played bowling,  the sword one and basket a lot with friends."
Wii Sports Resort,5:28 I love how he did one slice and it knocked two miis and fell dramatically!🤣
Wii Sports Resort,"(1 year later), finally a new nintendo sport game that is actually pretty good."
Wii Sports Resort,Canoeing is very good
Wii Sports Resort,Can't believe you didn't like cycling. It was def in my top 3
Wii Sports Resort,My favorite is single player showdown.
Wii Sports Resort,"I had this game when I was around 5 years old, and let me tell you I just had some MAJOR flashbacks!!!!"
Wii Sports Resort,Nintendo Wii sports resort 2009 Forever!
Wii Sports Resort,*There can only be one...*
Wii Sports Resort,"good to know my (2nd) favourite game is good.

(mario kart wii is still my faveriote)"
Wii Sports Resort,"I'm so glad I recently found this game at Goodwill for 5$ for my Wii U. I gave my wii/wii games away to one of my friends because I both didn't really play it anymore, and had no clue i'd be getting a Wii U within 3 months..."
Wii Sports Resort,"Cheers mate 
Considering buying Wii for this game only. 
Thanks for the insite keep it up"
Wii Sports Resort,why not review mk7 for 3ds?
Wii Sports Resort,"I have all of these games and Island Flyover is my favourite, I did a preview of Nintendo Wii tennis on my channel, but it's on Croatian."
Wii Sports Resort,"The Flying game is my favourite, I spent so much time on that and I love it!"
Wii Sports Resort,Please review mario party 6!!!!!
Wii Sports Resort,"4:58 - 5:11

Lovely little scene~

The colors of Wii sports resort always got me, do feel that the wave racer part could've been it's own game."
Wii Sports Resort,I have this game and is a jewel :')
Wii Sports Resort,the plane mode and fencing mode brings back many memories
Wii Sports Resort,POV: it’s 2021
Wii Sports Resort,I’m here in 2029 with Covid-19
Wii Sports Resort,100000000 out of 5
Wii Sports Resort,"I'm replaying the Wii sports games for nostalgia, and when I can't I watch this"

Wii Sports Resort,is there baseball
Wii Sports Resort,@385malik Thumbs up if you think xbox 360 is better!
Wii Sports Resort,"no, you are wrong! this is a plastc peice of shit. the movement is a bit better (i think nintendo should've waited and made this with the controller when wii was released instead of making u waste ur money on a less then steller upgrade. and u only need the accessory for 4 wii games. and the motion plus loses its center very often. and start to read your moves wrong."
Wii Sports Resort,"@TommyD758 Hey, they're both good consoles!"
Wii Sports Resort,@MyNameIsNintendo you can in wii fit
Wii Sports Resort,"@385malik fanboys are so freaking annoying, get a life"
Wii Sports Resort,@MyNameIsNintendo OMG THAT WOULD BE AWESOMEEE

Wii Sports Resort,"@pyramidheadkitten9

Wii Sports Resort,@MyNameIsNintendo A Wiinter Game :D
Wii Sports Resort,Hellish golf skill level!
Wii Sports Resort,...
Wii Sports Resort,They should make a sword fighting game with mii's that has a storyline.  that would be SO FUN!!
Wii Sports Resort,Netgear Beach Ball?
Wii Sports Resort,i like all the game systems (except ps2)
Wii Sports Resort,looks so cool
Wii Sports Resort,"My favorite is swordplay (as long as you master the blocks) then table tennis.  Least favorite?  Undoubtedly the canoeing one.  But it's one of those party games, so it isn't really my favorite.  But I can't wait for legend of Zelda skyward sword."
Wii Sports Resort,"@beybladestar 
Same Here c:"
Wii Sports Resort,@hulkamania1010 I really like the game. Its one of my favorites but my favorite game is loz oot
Wii Sports Resort,"If only they switched Table Tennis for regular tennis, & or added volleyball."
Wii Sports Resort,"@GameHackerification No, I the game, just that one game mode..."
Wii Sports Resort,Swordplay IS just a whole mess of random waggling....
Wii Sports Resort,i like your mii it really looks like you
Wii Sports Resort,"umm correction EVERYBODY!! the best game of wii is ""Just Dance"" and ""Just Dance 2!"" sorry if i corrected EVERYBODY! 



:)"
Wii Sports Resort,@hulkamania1010 yeah about that...no
Wii Sports Resort,"@axeljordan1 I think you mean ""canoeing."" And also ""kayaking."" And he is right, it is kayaking, not canoeing."
Wii Sports Resort,i too love swordplay!
Wii Sports Resort,los ingleses dais asco 
Wii Sports Resort,"@CCMKBProductions Dont forget Mario Kart,galaxy 1 and 2,Twilight Princess,and Brawl"
Wii Sports Resort,"Well,its certainly not must, must-have,its certainly not the best game on earth,its not like Ocarina of time,but its a good game,its just not hardcore"
Wii Sports Resort,"Wait, Basketball is un-enjoyable because you miss every shot? Basketball is the best game on there."
Wii Sports Resort,I love playing the games !
Wii Sports Resort,"????
"
Wii Sports Resort,In swordplay everytime i do waggling i lose -_-
Wii Sports Resort,"@BlondeCurlsBlueEyes 

with me its different. I love the archery, table tennis, swordfight/cut, standart golf and bowling. about everything else I dont care that much, cycling sucks, wakeboarding is okay, canoing is okay. basketball sucks as well. ah yeah I like the flyover but the jetski stuff and the skydiving stuff is not that good for me, too"
Wii Sports Resort,"I LOVE the island flyover, power cruising, skydiving and archery
I kind of like the table tennis, bowling and frisbee dog
I don't care much for caneoing, cycling, wakeboarding, swordplay or basketball
I HATE golf (both kinds)"
Wii Sports Resort,ill get it with black wii!
Wii Sports Resort,Is Nintendo gonna stop making Wii sports resort as a separate game since every console is bundled with it now? becauz i am thinkin about gettin the game.
Wii Sports Resort,asian dude with an english accent...
Wii Sports Resort,@hulkamania1010 il say yeah if i had this game lol
Wii Sports Resort,"@KraycieBone 

My bro has an XBoX.

I just can't stand how XboX nickels and dimes their customers. The system costs the most. The internet connection costs. The the not-so-great wireless router costs 100 fucking dollars! And, instead of releasing an entire game, they hold back on content, and then sell it to you for an extra 15$, calling them 'upgrades' or whatever.

At least Nintendo seems to take all customers into consideration and put real creativity in what they create and sell."
Wii Sports Resort,"You don't give swordplay enough credit at all--it's the best game on Wii Resort! It's perfect the way they made it.

It's only a bunch of random waggling if you both don't bother to block. Ya can't beat someone who actually blocks by swinging like a mad man, because then ya just wind up getting counter-attacked again and again.That's how I always beat my brother. He just whips his damn sword around and I just block, hit, block, hit, block, hit, hit, hit,hit, bam, off the stage."
Wii Sports Resort,@KPtwenty3 You sold it? Whyyyyyyyyy???
Wii Sports Resort,5:17 did he say down right or damn right?
Wii Sports Resort,"No, It has Bowling, but added precision, and 100-pin-bowling, it has Table Tennis. It has golf, no boxing or baseball. But there is 9 other games."
Wii Sports Resort,I can say one thing. If you liked the Wii Sports Original then you will like Wii Sports Resort too.
Wii Sports Resort,"PLEASE TELL ME SOMEONE
Is the resort just an update to the original wii sports
I want to know if there are the games from wii sports here in resort too
like the baseball and golf and other
liked to buy wii with the resort
What are other cool games for wii
Thank you
Please respond someone"
Wii Sports Resort,I play this game 24/7
Wii Sports Resort,"swordplay, wakeboarding and island flyover is the best!!!!"
Wii Sports Resort,"We just turned the tube on,,put in wii. Ive got it on the right channel,,but i cant get it to do anything.I replced the batteries too. It wont even click open a game,can someone HELP ?"
Wii Sports Resort,@hulkamania1010 I AGREE
Wii Sports Resort,AWSOME I WANT THIS GAME!
Wii Sports Resort,I  had  this    game
Wii Sports Resort,"mines iz i need friends, 0290 3764 4422 3228"
Wii Sports Resort,UNCHARTED 2 RULZ!!!
Wii Sports Resort,hahaha OF COURSE!!!!! even better than the modern warfare 2!!!!!
Wii Sports Resort,@iamjordandavoll me too lol
Wii Sports Resort,my fav is skidiveing
Wii Sports Resort,island flyover is my fav
Wii Sports Resort,"canoeiing is difficult and sometimes annoying, if I paddle to the right it sometimes goes to the left and vice versa. Cycling is big fun and bowling and pingpong ftw"
Wii Sports Resort,got it for christmas its awsome.
Wii Sports Resort,this game is fun :D...i think i will have this game soon!!
Wii Sports Resort,Uncharted 2 is better than any Wii game.
Wii Sports Resort,"Very fun, I loved the wakeboarding and aeroplane ones :D He's right about cycling and canoeing though, they'reoring, and basketball is a bit too simple. Frisbee was a lot mroe fun than expected! :) And bowling of course is great fun :D"
Wii Sports Resort,im getting this great game soon
Wii Sports Resort,me too!!! lol
Wii Sports Resort,this game is great to play with family and friends and i will be doing the same thing as you. i also got the black controler (i finaly have four wii remotes) and it looks sweet
Wii Sports Resort,actualy YOU DO Need it. i have it. doesnt work without it.
Wii Sports Resort,"Cycling looks good on paper, but using your hands as pedals ruined it for me. Jet Ski reminded me of Wave Race, clearly the best event along with Archery. Frisbee is fun, but VERY frustrating!"
Wii Sports Resort,Well doing the real thing isn't really comparative. If I went outside I wouldnt be able to race against 20 other people and race up a hill and across a huge bridge etc. I could jerk off though. But I dont think thats apart of the game :P
Wii Sports Resort,wtf cycling looks awesome though.
Wii Sports Resort,"Erm You can for certain games like bowling where you only need to use one control at once, but games like table tennis played in multiplayer mode are impossible without it due to the fact that you are both playing at the same time"
Wii Sports Resort,"I already have and its awesome, but you it does get boring after a while when you play by yourself."
Wii Sports Resort,genteeeeeeeeeeeee tenho esse jogo ele e loko o meu preferido e o avião o domeu irmao e da espada genteeeeeeee e loko meu xD
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Lol, “his loser rat,” made me laugh"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,This Video was awesome!
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,10:29 this whole thing made me laugh way more than it should have 😂
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Just got back into on my phone.  Love how i can be my other friend by using the other gameboy simulator to trade those pokemon needed to so they can evolve.  Amazing game.  Yes, it's quite interesting how so many cry about these old gems, than theyl go play some sour corporate modern milk that was pushed out with nothing but bugs, but theyl say it's great because the company paid them to.  Than when a competitors game comes out, they basically go on a witch hunt.  I'm sure if that company spared a few shillings for the youtuber, he may habe a change of heart.  Oh what a world, what a world, I'm melting. ...."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,My guy naming his pokemon after the Bulls players of 96 and on
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Clefairy was actually intended to be the original mascot of the series. It even carried over to one of the mangas.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Say no to the great reset
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"good old childhood memories...back then we had to figure out all the game secrets and stuff by ourselfes (internet wasnt really common around here / 56k modem) or had to buy gaming magazines with tipps and tricks, still makes me smile when i think about that such a simple game kept us entertained for like half a year"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Gen 1 is underrated thats for sure, from gen 2 to 5 they improved the formula by a lot and those gens are amazing games, but after that the games started to be rushed cutting corners and bad quality, though oras is decent and sun and moon is acceptable, every other main series pokemon games from gen 6-8 are trash, x and y is the best one of those and its still a mess of a game"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,8:45 until you get a Kadabra.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"The problem with complaining about the jankiness of games, especially older ones, is that the jankiness is often part of what makes them fun. Figuring out on your own ways to abuse the system is exciting and satisfying. For years, decades, even, I would claim (even to myself) that Pokemon Gold/Silver were my favorites because they were bigger, more colorful, ""objectively better"", but it wasn't G/S I kept going back to play. It was R/B. It wasn't G/S I would play with self-imposed challenges, it was R/B. I had a good time in the year 2000 playing Gold/Silver, but I've had dozens upon dozens of good times playing Red/Blue over the past 20+ years. The difference between Pokemon R/B and other RPGs is like the difference between riding your bike as a kid vs driving your car an adult. You just got on your lime green bicycle with ""Swamp Rider"" emblazoned on it, and you rode; you didn't have to make sure you had gas or money for gas, you didn't need to check to make sure traffic wasn't going to be miserable, or worry that this might be the time your catalytic converter really decides to screw you. You just pick up and play and it's easy to understand but engrossing enough to keep you playing. It's janky and it's simple and that's a big part of what makes it still fun even to this day. And, unlike something like Digimon World (which I enjoy, also for its jankiness) its jankiness is never really to its detriment. It's a whole lot of fun. It may not be competitively balanced, but I'm not playing, nor do I ever intend to, play competitively, so who cares?"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,this makes me want to play my copy of yellow again once i beat all the kanto gym leaders in pokemon silver
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I grew up during pokemania in the late 90s and Red was my second game after Link's Awakening. I've been a player ever since. I have to say though, just because something's the first in a series doesn't mean it's the best. I feel FireRed is a way better Kanto experience with actual post game."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Nice video bro
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I totally agree with you. Red and Blue are my favorite games in the series too. They’re so much fun, they’re very flexible and replayable, influential, and don’t take themselves too seriously."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Great review. Thanks man!
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I think most people really do appreciate Gen 1 for starting this series, most people do praise it for how innovative it was, but I don't think a game being innovative is enough of a reason to claim it to be the best. Just because a game is the first at doing something doesn't mean it's the best one. Praising it for what it's accomplished is fine, but nothing here was any point on what it does better than any other game. Great video and all, but the point of the video doesn't make much sense to me. (Coming from someone that just replayed Red & Yellow trying to find some reviews)"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Totally agree, and im glad to see someone who doesnt bash gen 1 for honestly unfair reasons. A lot of people say that this game aged poorly, but without counting the glitches or the limited inventory i never see why is that the case. Graphics were amazing for its time, with a unique artstyle (anime wasnt release yet, so i dont know why they criticize its different designs). Music is PERFECT, possible my favorite 8 bit soundtrack. And while gameplay isnt perfectly balanced, it was revolutionary and arguably the best RPG of their time.
Also, a lot of that ""broken"" mechanics that some people said, werent discover until much years later, so is unfair to take that into account for a negative point. And the multiplayer wasnt the focus like with modern Pokemon games. Besides, i never though the mechanics were as broken as many people pretend to be but it would take a lot of text and time to explain. But what i can said, is that it has its own balance compared to newer games and that doesnt make it bad.
Is not my favorite Pokemon game, but is damn close."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,This was so good my first game I'll never forget lavender town. I tried lets go but it's not the same
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Will an unopened Pokemon Blue ever be worth $1M one day? I hear Red was worth more. After seeing stories in the news about Zelda and Super Mario 64 auctions.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Eevee was my favorite still is you can always use it on your team.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I love this video and I love and grew up on Gen 1, but I think you may be conflating the words ""favorite"" and ""best"" 
I love RBY despite their warts but they have some blatant game breaking design decisions and glitches (the Wrap exploit for instance)
They were certainly the pioneers of the series, but i would strongly push back against using ""best"" in any objective context"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"""Game Freak has never made a better game after this"" I suppose if we're talking about building from the ground up and starting from scratch from a design standpoint and a conceptual standpoint, yeah, you'd be right."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Also shout-out to the people who decided to put the time in to give each Pokemon their own Cry sfx, and also for deciding to double their workload by choosing to make also make back-sprites so that you can feel like a Trainer standing behind your Pokemon and giving them commands in battle."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"This was a pretty eye-opening video, because like you said, Gen 1 is a punching bag. Everyone really likes grinding it down and saying how it's unbalanced or primitive or whatever. It's nice to see some appreciation for the roots of the series, especially in a style that balances humor and critique like yours. Great video, man. I'll be checking out more of your content very soon."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,it's funny as they originally wanted calefairy to be the mascot.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,We didn't get them in the UK until 1999 - the Game Boy came out here in 1990 - that would be like them releasing an Cube game in 2011 - that's bonkers when you think about it.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,LMFAOOOO @ 1:52. Naming your squad after the Chicago bulls 99 lineup has me dying right now
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"All these Quest title, and yet you forgot MapQuest. Such a missed opportunity 😄"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Quest 64... that's a name i haven't heard in a long time.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Mmm Yes hair man video. This is a happy day
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"That's the really bizarre thing about Red and Blue to me. In a vacuum, they're insanely good games but their sequels were so good at fixing it's flaws that the original only feels unplayable by comparison. If you forced me to play Red and Blue, I'd still have a good time, but I'd have a much better time playing Fire Red and Leaf Green instead (or insert best game here)."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Mascot definitely should have been Tangela. Just look at that thing. Pikachu wouldn't stand a chance.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"You make great points in why these games stand so tall in their own series.
Loved the Pokemon Stadium music. Loved the Quest rundown. And how bout that sweet Squirtle nickname? xP
I'm happy we live in the timeline where Pikachu is the mascot. Fun video that celebrates Pokemons origins!"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"""Quest waste removal company""
That one got me"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Excellent timing. Right when I had to take a dump. To stress about the numbers and formulae and mechanics is to miss the entire point of pokemon which is a sentiment that feels lost. Red and Blue is the only game in the series that set out to be an RPG rather than setting out to be a pokemon game and that's a strong distinction. The effort put forth the justify things that exist in the pokemon world were never attempted again. I just wish a real gamer had made a video like this instead.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Saying Chrono Trigger isn't balanced is a complete understatement. What was the point of them even adding dual skills when 99% of them are worthless while the remaining 1% is just as good as using two separate skills by themselves.
Though I agree with Quest 65*, all you need for that game is Rock."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,i saw so many pokemon youtubers and so many playthroughs do I didn't know if I wanted to watch another one. but its you so I wanted to give it a chance. but then you said pokemon green was released alone in japan??? so literally the first thing you say is wrong and you want to do an retrospective? no thanks
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,The game is not based on the manga you uncultured swine
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Bit late but
59:25
I'm imagining Baloo from the Jungle Book in the river here"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"1:01:04 A bit late im sure, but this isn't true. Those machines at the side are actually quiz machines, answer the question correctly and the gate will open and you will be allowed through without a fight (you can still force a fight if you want to) but get it wrong and you will be forced into battling the trainer. 

Its one of my favourite hidden little things, I don't think it was supposed to be hidden, but most people don't seem to know about it and it took me well over a decade of playing before I decided to click on those machines."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"In Blaine's gym, you don't have to fight any of the trainers. You can do the quizes from the machines in the corners of each section to open the doors."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Fun fact, but there is an optional rival fight.  If you go to victory road before encountering your rival in Cerulean city your rival will be there for a nice battle (and some money and XP)."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"""It doesn't work with Muk"" is the best joke in this video."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"As far as the elite four coming out of nowhere, and not being adequately foreshadowed... i didn't have that experience at all. I remember in my original game, I investigated the Pokemon League the very first time it opened up, and every time i got a new badge, i went back, hoping i'd unlocked something new. of course i was disappointed each time lol. i specifically remember how much i grew to hate going back through mount moon each time.

I feel like giving you early access to the Pokemon League, just not actually allowing you inside the building, is great foreshadowing... i was kinda surprised you didn't mention it, and apparently didn't agree..."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Love talking about balls
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,wow this uploader and his community seem like pricks. instead of just acknowledging that you got stuff wrong in your video you send your community to harass the guy. what an asshole.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Oh my freaking god 24:45 was me for my whole childhood. 😂

I also which I had the ability to test that Mew glitch."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Definitely chose squirtle.
He’s objectively the best throughout the game. Especially early on and late game."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"24:43 I thought the same, even as a kid in the states lol."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,If you use the PC in the hotel to view the Hall of Fame it breaks your hall of fame.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I caught articuno with a pokeball. And it was my last pokeball after throwing every ultra ball, great ball I had at it. It was an incredible feeling."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"24 years of playing these games and only now I find out you can CUT THE GRASS?!



Hot damn."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,This game paved the way for most people's favorites like gen 2 and gen 3
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Long story short: yes
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I appreciate that you approached this from an angle that tries not to look at Gen 1 through the lens of living in Generation 9. Yes, Gen 1 is indeed a broken mess, but I think it deserves to be looked at by its own merits and context.

24:48 I about flipped when you said this, because I thought the EXACT same thing when I was a kid. And I'm American!

1:01:05 I'm sure others have mentioned it and you already know this, but I feel the need to point out that you don't need to fight any of the trainers in Blane's gym at all. The machines in the corner of the rooms ask trivia questions, and if you answer correctly, you can bypass the trainer entirely

Call me an old man all you want, but I absolutely stand by the statement that no Pokèmon game after Gen 1 got the Viridian Forest music right. (GSC gets a pass cause it's a direct sequel)

The MissingNo glitch also works on the shore of the Sea Foam Islands. Would have been nice to know that it worked on Cinnabar Island when I was a kid lol

Good grief, the way you described 'M as the evil version of MissingNo is wild."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,lol butt
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Why is the tactic to go nidorino with horn attack of all things 😅. By lavender town u should be able to evolve to nidoking and teach him psychic then or dig.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Tactical genius for bulbasaur?

If you base the starter pick on the first 2 gyms (which is the basis until which you start to really have a full fledged team):
Bulbasaur: easy
Squirtle: normal
Charmander: hard

Although, in the end, Blastoise is the best pick for the highest amount of gyms, but you don't run the game entirely with a single pokemon."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Wait, you didn't do the quizzes in the fire gym?"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Someone can fact check but I thought if you beat all the trainers in the game then it resets all the trainers to active again.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Wow 2 not even 2 minutes in and factually wrong. Red and green released in Japan not just green. It was released in other regions with blue version. The global red and blue getting actual visual updates compared to the first launch
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Man thank you for this. Today I had 10 hours of work and I just finished watching the whole video and that was fantastic. I not tired now. That was very fun. My mother years ago gave my gen 1 red to a cousin and never came back to me. Know I will install an emulator to play this stuff again so nostalgic 😂😂🎉
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Josh : ""I'm going to complete everything, and break the game so bad it's gonna make your head spin !"" Also Josh : ""I'm getting my ass kicked, I finally manage to leave the cave and ... I talk to that girl outside and get in another fight..."" :D"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"You are so kind... Naming your rival ""butt"", with 3 letters left over... :D"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Josh: struggling against Alakazam Recover spam
1996 me: *laughs in Disable*"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I could be 100% wrong, but I think Oak's PC in his lab has an email about the Pokemon League/Elite four."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"1:01:07 you DON'T have to fight the majority of trainers in Blaine's gym though. If you talk to the machines, all you need to do is answer a question correctly and the doors will open.

I always fight the trainers afterwards though, because I'm on that Exp grind"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Ah, yes, i see you named your rival Butt. How classy 😂"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,I choose Squirtle because I wanted to have Gamera XD because I'd always name him Gamera it'd go so well with  Blastoise
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Swift bypasses the accuracy glitch you mentioned
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,I chose squirtle.. 😢 and I always will
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"What a wonderful love letter to a couple of my first video games, thank you for sharing this with us. Makes me sad they haven't made it available for new generations to play"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Uhm it started the most successful media franchise of all time, so yeah I think these were good lol"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,this 100% made my day and i loved watching every single second of it!
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I was a nintendo power subscriber at the time and so I got Pokemon Blue for the North American launch!

and through that lens? through the lens of Satoshi Tajiri being a video game developer and a magazine columnist first? Pokemon being a video game first makes COMPLETE sense."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"The Top 4(elite 4) thing - i think somewhere in the game world is a TV you can interact with where you see a match or something 

Also remember there was the TV Show - they were called differently on that (at least in the german version) but on that it was clear that the motivation of Ash is to become a Pokemon  master - i.e. win the Competition he gets the gym badges for the whole collection thing is more for the Gameboy and Emphasizing the Link cable stuff 

so if you were little back then and saw the TV show you knew that This is the Goal - I wanna be the very best like no one ever was - and yes he is called Red or Blue depending on the game version but the fade in to the World is exactly like the 1st Episode (as close as they could get it at least) - in yellow you cant even choose the starter so 7yo Me was convinced you play Ash Ketchum"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"You do so many little things wrong it makes me itch, but you can get away with it in this you do you.
Like 1:01:06 you're supposed to answer pokemon trivia questions and fight the trainers if you get them wrong, and you managed to not notice that mechanic at all"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,27:27 - use growl six times to get it at level 1 then give it a tiny bit of exp to get it straight to level 100. lots of people seem to forget that.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"@11:08 - AAH eye of the beholder, my jam."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,I taught the same thing about the cerulean guard...always taught it was a hat
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I learned so much from this. I had no idea it was possible to capture Mew, and I'm blown away from all the other glitches and stuff you showed. I had no idea I needed a status effect to capture pokemon. I just lowered the hp, and then tried again, and again, until I did a capture. I knew about missingNo, but I never tried to capture it. One thing I did hear is that Psychic was supposed to be... Ghost, I think, but the weakness didn't get implemented properly. The game could have been done better, in a lot of ways, but it still caused an absolute revolution, and a lot of the issues that came up actually enhanced the game for many of us. MissingNo is iconic game lore."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,There's a couple glitches you can do with the pokecenter being exactly five steps.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,I don't have a reference for the master ball thing. I always thought it looked like a Venonat
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,When I was a kid I always chose fire pokémon because fire was awesome. As I grow up. I realized that The easiest pokémon to beat the game with Solo is Squirtle. Mainly because how broken the base game is and how OP water is
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I knew 95% of the content but the nastaglia was unreal and watched the entire thing. 
Great vid!"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Swift bypasses the accuracy check, it will always hit. The 1/256 miss glitch doesn’t come into play."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"back in '99 we used to copy pokemon yellow/blue/red game+emulator in a 3.5"" floppy and have a lot of space left over. lol"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Butt. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Not really. But. We love it all the same.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,ah yes the origin of Loot Boxes.....
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"""It doesnt work with muck"" lmao."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"As a kid i used fly as the world map, i did this for 2nd and 3rd generations as well. I also only used moves that dealt damage and looked visually cool and had cool sounds 😎"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Just going through comments and realizing that pokemon fans are insane basement dwellers, holy effing fuck"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"My favorite lore ""myth"" about Pokemon is that every Ditto you see is a failed attempt to clone Mew. They both have the same color for their sprites (pink for regular, blue for shiny), they weigh the exact same (8.8 lbs), they are the only Pokemon that can learn Transform, and the places you can encounter Ditto in Gen 1 are places connected to either Mew or Mewtwo (the mansion and the Cerulean Cave)."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"To think that in that point, when we first played this game, we did not know how massive and influential this game/franchise would be… it is quite a realisation."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,fun fact the game code was so bad and poorly optimised that when Satoru Iwata joined the team for gen 2  and developed better tools and compressions he was able to not only make gold and silver so much bigger but included the entire first region because he could.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,I made my way through that cave in the pitch black as well haha.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Blanes gym allowed like always for you to answer questions to skip battles. One of the modt iconic questions were ""butterfree had 3 evolutions"" yes or no?"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Pokemon Red and Blue are one of those games that shows just how powerful marketing is. Because when you realize how absurdly busted *everything* is in this game, it makes you scratch your head how it was considered a good contender for having sequels made."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"""moves which don't do damage may . ."" let me stop you right there. 
Moves which don't do damage might as well not exist to the 7 year old mind! ..well ..sleep and paralysis maybe - but .. even those are on notice!"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,seriously... nobody chose Bulbasaur!
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Not all Pokémon names work backwards, like Muk………😂😂😂😂"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I love how you're explaining this so someone who's never played Pokemon can understand yet it's not boring for us veterans. There were some important gameplay mechanics and things about to gameboy printer that you got incorrect though (probably a few more than listed but these stuck out to me the most)


1. Electric is neutral against ice however all of Lorelei's pokemon are dual types with water except for Jynx
2. Repels only repel Pokemon below the level of your highest party member. So that's why you're getting less encounters as some pokemon are lower than your party lead and no longer appeared. You can get no encounters if you're a higher level than all wild encounters in the area.
3. You can't print in red and blue, only yellow, gen 2 and spinoffs
4. It doesn't use ink as it's a thermal printer so you can just go to a stationary store like Officeworks or whatever the equivalent is overseas, buy a roll of thermal paper and just cut it to size and the gameboy printer isn't as wide as receipt printers. People also sell them in the right size online. VERY easy to find and it's not expensive."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"80 minutes is too much for me, can someone just tell me if he liked it or not"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"When you realize pokemon select at the beginning isn't just a pokemon select.
It's a fucking difficulty select!

Charizard will get very strong later and can hugely help you (But gets murdered by Rock. oh no...rock in Gen 1 :-P...) but since your first gym is BROCK, it will be a slightly rough start.
Blastoise is kind of middle of the road, not bad, not fastastic. Also Brock's weakness, so you can roll the first gym.
Venusaur is the low pick because fire is much more common, and guess what it's weakness would be! It's also not as strong stat-wise (or not where it matters)."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I guess I'm weird. I'm a Squirtle kind of guy! lol, Still have my original blue cart. I might have to break out the Super Gameboy sometime soon!"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Yes duh
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"11:10:02 ice is,not weak to electric, water is. just about every ice type in this game is also part water, which is partly why zapdos swept here"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,51:44 did most people not realise they can cut grass using Cut? I guess i randomly figured it out as a kid
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,I fell asleep while watching this last night. Apparently the entire video played and now im watching it again. Hopefully it counts as two views!
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Manga is based on the game.....not the other way round
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"This was a very well and complete video, it covered all big and minor parts of the game. 151/10"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"What do you mean by ""ruined it""? That made it so much better for me"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,An advert every four minutes.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Why so much emphasis on the 'H'
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,The fight with Blue/Gary at the end was truly one of the pieces of music. Hearing it gives me chills like it did to me as a kid.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"40:29 for anyone that’s curious, the unown letters spell out “Leave” here"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Actually i watched this again cause something was bugging me. You missed a mention to the elite four almost at the very beginning of the game. You fell into the pro gamer trap of just running to the first pokemart and back to oak, but if you instead head down victory road youll have an encounter with butt, that you seem to have missed, in which he explains what victory road is."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Muk.... Kum : DDD
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"The set order of the map is actually pretty helpful, as it will show you the order in which you are meant to progress - in case you ever get stuck. :)"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"RE: bug pokemon suck. I won't say you are wrong, because ya, BUT butterfree gets confusion and sleep powder pretty early and thats useful through mt moon. I Don't think you can get any other psychic move before that. Also, its pretty fast so is best when trying to get its own replacement, Abra, as early and as easily as possible. In the remakes paras can learn cut flash and rock smash, so it was somewhat a good choice for hm dumping."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Pointing out that Erika's gym is full of women makes you a perv??? Dudes like you are the reason most young males today are asexual.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Correction: in the manga, the main protagonist is Red and the main male rival is *Green.* Blue is the *female* rival, off of whom the female avatar in FRLG is based. The male rival was renamed Blue in the west because we didn't get Pokémon Green. Which unfortunately lead to the absolute nonsense that is Blue (the actual Blue) being dubbed fucking *Leaf* in the west, because everyone associates her actual name with Green."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Another thing for the 3 Starter Pokemon, they are also a hidden ""difficulty"" choice, since the first 3 Gyms are arranged in an order that the 3 Pokemon basically represent ""Easy"" , ""Medium"" and ""Hard"" difficulty."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,In Gen 1 actually opponents chose their action after you
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,“Disney’s flagship mascot cowers in the shadow of the famous yellow mouse” 😂😂 what a line! Great video as always!!
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Haunter doesn't need to be traded for me! He's cool enough as he is!
And not because I didn't have friends!
...
Haunter was my friend."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Blue def better than red. Meowth payday is love, and life."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"There's a second nearby trainer who can help you catch another Mew.

Inside Misty's gym, on the right hand side of the screen is a swimmer. Repeat the Mew glitch but fight this guy instead of the Slowpoke trainer. When you return to Nugget Bridge, another Mew will spawn."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,People know more about the history of pokemon than the history of the 20th century 🤦‍♂️
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"i remember how my kadabra basically got me through all the game of blue, psychic was so broken 🤣"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Was it good?
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,This is making me wonder how in the hell I managed to complete this game while also finding all the HMs as a child. If I was playing this for the first time as an adult I'd definitely need to check online a lot for certain key items
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I really would love to see gold/silver, sir."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,I can't remember if it applies to Pokemon Red/Blue but there is actually a trick to the slot machines in LeafGreen and FireRed. Hope you cover that one next!
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Fun little detail: The Dragon-type trainer Lance is known as Siegfried in the german version of the game and the show, so that whole reference thing may be possible."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"The graphics are very poor, even for GameBoy standards, with many of the sprites looking like horrible monstrous blobs, the story, while better than some in the series, is far from the peak of the series, and most of all, the gameplay was wacky and glitchy and unbalanced."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"45,910 views"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Bro who’s here in 2021 wtf

Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,What I dont understand is how on ebay they are selling Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow for like 30-50$ USD when it was the most sold game in Gameboy Color history. I mean its only the most common game ever for that console.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,austin sounds so wierd 4 years ago Lol

Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Thumbs Up If You Like To Make The First Letter Of Every Word Capitalized
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Nah, the battery in the cartridge that i bought does work, since these cartridges can last almost 16 years and they were produced from 1998 to 2001, so the save battery isn't dead yet, and there's a possibility that somebody might have changed the battery."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"The batteries in all the cartridges are dead now, so you wont be able to save the game. "
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Well, if i would have had to buy the newest Pokemon game out there, i would have had to buy a new DSi or 3DS for my friend, since only handheld console happens to be a GBA SP, so i thought buying the original would have been the best idea..."

Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,i remember back when i was 8 i found one of the pokemon games in front of a neighbors house and it was sitting near the curb and i had a gameboy at the time so i thought i would try it out and it was a great game nice review
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"haha i still have them, my level 100 snorlax =] back in the days... "
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,i would love to see a Game & Watch Review
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"when I had the original DS, shortly after, I lost my patience on games like these. I probably spent hundreds of hours training, which I could not ever do again. All these different color pokemon games were all the same to me. I only bought the Gold and Red version"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"@JohnMedia7 Thanks, that was the plan."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"You should have shown yourself catching mew :). and you didn't show pokemon green version :(. But pokemon is epic honestly, well the old ones at least."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,you are really  running out of ideas and money duncan... pokemon? really?

Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Awesomeness :)
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,this makes me want to find my gameboy and my red version and live in the nostalgia for awhile 
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"there is 152 pokemons to catch!
missingno<3"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Kinda late but ehh.... Yeah.....
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,I had a game like Pokemon for my Neo Geo Pocket called Evolution - Eternal Dungeons.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,@jonnyboywasheretoday No that's the bezel of my GBA SP. It's hard recording Game Boy games.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,your not playing the game on a gameboy are you?! i see your ipod touch metal reflecting a bit
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,are you running out of things to review?
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Best games i ever played :P
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,I used to have yellow lol
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,i don't see any yellow
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,I still play them today lol
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Hey Tama, here is a bit of my thoughts that usually go uncommented but you seem to be on the same direction. 

The pixel art in old screens doesn't look so sharp on the edges and the small screen size made the blur effective to moving characters. With the concept art on the manuals and anime on TV,  the story of our player journeys was painted on imagination with the Gameboy being an acessory to game play. Much in the same way as player books and character sheets on D&D.

As for balancing, puzzle solving etc your video about rental market drives the 2nd point perfectly. Generation 1 has the most replay value from just going through the game and generation 2 has the best replay value to playing with the entire eco system. As you've said in another video, it is unfair to take gen2 without Stadium2 as a post game in a way.

To me this is what kills some later generations. You clear the story once and the game is no longer so enjoyable to travel around. They feel like card games after you've finished it the first time and replay factor seems to be almost planned to fade aground 2 or 3 years for the next gen to release."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,I'm middle ground to gen1 it was first Pokemon
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Wow this video is such a fresh perspective on the original games. Probably gonna play yellow again for the nostalgia
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Wonderful video, I thoroughly enjoyed it, you make valid points on how it is a broken game to some others, but if we didn't have these made versions of Pokemon  Red and Blue, we wouldn't have all these other games that followed up right behind it, in general. I do have nostalgia eyes for them, absolute gems in my opinion, but I do like the remakes to them as well, FireRed and LeafGreen are both great remakes. I just restarted my FireRed vision not too long ago 😅"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Now i wanna try those dungeons. A neat thing aboung gen 1 was the speed. 
I found this video enjoyable as well. Amazing job✌️🔥"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I really love this review. It's refreshing to hear someone not call these games ""unplayable because of the glitches"" or type charts. As you said, I really had to go out of my way to try and encounter glitches when I played these as a kid and even now. I also remember encountering Lance for the first time and going against his Dragonairs and Dragonite, having never seen them before and overcoming the challenge of defeating these pokémon despite having no idea about their weaknesses. I think it's ok to have some types to be better than others, especially here where Psychic and Dragon types are rare to come across and present a memorable challenge to beat.

I've played almost every generation of Pokémon (I missed gens 6 and 7) and I would also have to say that the music in gen 1 still holds up incredibly and has given us the most iconic tracks of the pokemon gaming franchise.

I also love the simpler story of this and gen 2. You're sent out on your own adventure as a 10 year old and happen to take down the criminal organisation. I've always found the storylines where you save the world, because it's expected of you, to be way too over the top personally. Despite it's own issues, Pokémon Sword and Shield did well in this area."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,I just loved how every town was it's own colour. So happy when I got my super gameboy.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,download the quality of life hack. improves the base game
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I've always found the most hypercritical takedowns of Gen 1 seem to come from a place of jealousy. They're almost always voiced by someone who wasnt around when the games released and so they missed the unparalleled phenomena that was Pokemania. Pokemon might be popular today, but it's absolutely nothing compared to the late 90s.

Gen 1 were games designed by 9 people nearly 30 years ago, and they still have less game-breaking glitches than Scarlet and Violet shipped with."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Its strange i loved it as a kid now im 33 i struggle playing it but i do listen to the original soundtrack often. Brings back the fantastic memories without having to play them.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,I still do a play thru of gen 1 at least once a year. I love gen 1 with all of it's flaws. When they re-realsed the original games on the 3DS I loaded that sucker up so now I have all original 6 games. I think I'll go play Blue version right now actually!
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Regarding dragon type, you can buy Magik Carp for 500 early on. Grind it to lvl 20. Now you have Gyaradps early game. It makes early game a breeze as n
Ut is so OP it is not even funny. Dragon Range 2 shots everything until they are lvl 30+ and you can teach it hyper beam early on by buying the TM and have basically a late game attack for most of the game (gyarardos learns it at level 55 as well) or, if hyperbeam is not quute hitting hard enough earthquake for that 100 power every turn slaughter. In fire red the special stat is not that high for late game (though insane for lvl 30) but it can still make use of some elemental attacks that use the special."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,These games were technical marvels. The whole ass game is 510KB... The whole game... Like all the 8 or 9 cities andnopen areas in between... Crazy.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,First time on your channel excellent video
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Mew truck
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Honestly? I prefer the remake more today. And the same goes to gen II.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Ok. After 10 minutes. I just quit. You can do better.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Yeah- I find hard linking what you're saying with random scenes. Please, improve that issue. For the rest, gratz

Ofc, this is a POV from a person who didn't face the ""Pokémon fever"" whem it came up, but it barely acceptable"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"As someone who just started playing pokémon since 2019, I can give you my unbiased opinion: I think gen 1 is actually good and fun. It has its issues, but I think those add some charm to it, idk how to explain it but it felt good and I couldn't stop playing it"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"gen 1 is the best because it was the framework for the entire series,"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"0:21 well said, amen 🙏"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Such a good video. So much thought. And btw, I’ve played red several times and will play it more. I use lets go pikachu for online battles and I play gameboy color for the story game."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Gen 1 is honestly the greatest and always will be. There is beauty in simplicity, but it’s not that simple either. Red/blue had balance but complex strategy. The Pokémon seemed real also like animals and such. There is too much fiction and wierd Pokémon in the new ones."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I just found your ""Pokémon First Gen Glitches"" videos and caught my first ever Mew in Pokémon Yellow (level 100 of course). Better late than never, right? If anything, I think the first gen. ""bugs"" ad a lot of excitement and replay ability to the games. 2023 and I'm still playing gen. 1 and it led me here to your channel where I'm really enjoying the content!"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,10:48 I freaked out because they way you edited the video seemed like you encountered a level 50 Zapdos chilling outside of Pallet Town xD
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,The best thing about early Pokémon games is that there is much less hand holding.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Even if you are bored with these games still you can use them for nuzlocke.
And you not gonna play just play 7 gen Pokemon let's go evee/Pikachu.
And you'll have respect for these games again.
That's how get to respect these titles."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Fire Red is still the best, I must apologize but if I was going to introduce old Pokemon to new players it's gonna be through fire red."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,“Gen 1 is too easy” yeah and the twists on Sesame Street have become so predictable lately
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Gen 1 isn't very buggy considering I only experienced glitches on purpose
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,I didn't know you still did YouTube. I watched your videos years ago!
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Wait, how are FireRed and LeafGreen inferior? Not only are they more polished, they have more content, and feature quality of life updates/changes. They're the definitive versions of the Gameboy classics. Plus the mod support."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"compared to current games, is it good? no, not at all. is it still fun? yes. it doesn't have to be GOOD to be FUN"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"If they ever go back to Kanto region, I really hope it’s with the idea of like, Kanto, 30 years after Red and blue or something. To give us something really fresh, and flesh out the Kanto region more"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,I’ve never disliked gen 1 but always considered them to have aged poorly. But I’ve never really thought about these games like this before and it’s given me a whole new perspective on them. Really glad I just recently rediscovered your channel
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"The quality of gens 1 and 2 are very subjective, and while I only dislike gen 1 for how basic and buggy they are, that does not take away from the fact that it was designed for a playthrough first and foremost, VS was literally so much of an afterthought that the games bugginess only comes into effect there"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"This is a fantastic video, please make more like this!"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"If there was a mobile app that ported 
the original games I am pretty sure it
would make a TON of money."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I recently replayed Red for the umpteenth time and, while I never considered myself a ""Genwunner"", I see so many things in these games that make them a worthwhile play even nowadays and even with so many revisions not only of the region but also of the general Pokemon brand. 

The battle mechanics you briefly touched on are unlike any other Pokemon generation, which makes different moves and pokemon shine than you'd expect, coming from later generations. Something as simple as a Raticate with Hyperfang can be genuinely useful because of the crit mechanics, the limited Normal resistances and the generally lower power level. Ekans and Arbok are completely built on the nefarious purpose of abusing Wrap and Glare or Toxic, making them genuine options where in later games you'd barely ever consider them. Farfetch'd of all things has a niche because it's the earliest learner of Swords Dance you'll find during progression (and it sure saved me as a kid, leading to it becoming one of my favorites alongside the popular Charizard). The wonky interaction between boosting and critical hits makes a person who *knows* the mechanics consider wether to go boosting or critting - Farfetch'd again being a great example because it also learns Slash, albeit much later. This creates a strange, probably unintentional, scenario where boosting isn't necessarily the end all be all and high crit moves like Razor Leaf or Slash stay relevant even in the endgame despite the lower base power, effectively increasing variety. Also, the way stat experience works is much MUCH more accessible than the current EV system. I'm not just saying that either - throughout my college years, when Pokemon suddenly became cool again, I battled quite a few people on break and a constant factor was the question wether one knew about EVs or no and deciding on teams based on that. Where stat exp just worked no matter how you trained, EVs are splitting factor that makes connecting just that extra bit more difficult.

The region being centered around Saffron makes it open enough that as a kid you can wander and find new things in every direction while on replays it's ripe for experimentation with some of the order you can do things in. It also makes Fly a convenient secret move to find rather than a necessity as it is in later generations with more linear map design. I know this is easy to overblow, but just the option to do it differently adds some spice for me. As an example, Kanto flows much better to me if I do Blaine after Koga and I *can* even though according to the trainer card, Sabrina is supposed to be the 6th gym leader.

Sorry for the long comment, I just find Gen1 Kanto fascinating to replay and talk about."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I have a biased love for generation 1. Not even ashamed of it. It has my favorite pokemon of all time, it introduced me to the world of Pokemon, and while it has its flaws, I enjoy red, blue, and yellow enough to replay them over and over. Currently, I am doing a 100 challenge of pokemon yellow where I catch and raise 100 pokemon to level 100 before the elite 4. All so that I can compete in the prime cup in Pokemon Stadium. Lol!"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"It feels like the fandom often forgets pokemon is mostly the adventure, not the post game.  Which is funny, bc that's the crowd who talso tends to drop a pokemon game in a year and not sink their teeth into the rpg world of the post games."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,I find it so weird that people use the glitches as something that makes the games worse or bad when I find glitches that add to the experience of a game as always a positive. Fun or useful glitches were always exciting to find.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"My main issue with the typing is how psychics should never have been so overpowered. If Gengar was never poison it would just be a case of who is faster wins against Alakazam. Oh and why was Gyarados flying type?

Its as it they knew some would be too powerful so had to deliberately make them weaker"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"23:30 Link's Awakening glitched on me in my first playthrough, which prevented me from being able to complete one of the last dungeons.  I will never forgive it for that."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Pokémon firered and leafgreen are direct upgrades of these games. ‘Nuff said.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,i am 35 gen 1 was my favorite series all the new stuff just confuses me also want to point out when you grow up watching tv on a analog big box tv its hard to really explain looking at it now the graphics look horrible but as a kid back then those graphics where very clear essentially back then it looked like hd does to me now but now that there is hd it looks horrible if that makes any sense i look back at these old games and i am like damn i dont remember it looking that bad i remember crisp detail and great visuals
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Growing Up with Gen 1 and 2 but ""Solid Gamedesign"" is Not the First Word that came to my mind when i thinking about Gen 1 and 2 Pokemon Games😅."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,The script for this video is poetry
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I played Red Version when it came out and am replaying it in 2022 and I still love it. Thank goodness for the backlit screens of the 3ds though, it was rough back in 1998."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Formula they built from scratch


Smt: Am I a joke to you"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Video title: Red and Blue
Game being played: Yellow
Ok Tama, explain"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,I love your approach to analyzing the deeper themes to the Pokemon world. I find myself wanting some official book or documentary on what the creative process is for this franchise but you've done a great job on explaining the inner workings.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Gen 1 was just so simple and I still love it for that. No forced story elements or weak attempts at character development. Just a fun adventure with great music. Gen 2 retained that simple feel while also somehow adding several layers of complexity. It was Gen 1 with an extreme amount of polish. I loved Gen 3 and 5 and liked Gen 4, but they just kind of kept dumping more and more stuff on and it got really messy for me. I’ll always remember the refreshing simplicity of the first two gens.

Also…yeah sure all Pokémon games are easy. But Gen 6 and forward are absolutely braindead difficulty."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Ok, these games are good*

*because

- for their time they’re actually not too buggy
- for the first entry in a series they get a ton of things right
- probably some other asterisks I forgot throughout watching the video

Which is fine, the points you made were generally valid in my opinion, but unless I misunderstood you, you said at the start of the video that these games are good without an asterisk. I don’t understand why you would go on to talk about asterisks for half an hour if that’s the hook you went with.

It’s fine to still like the gen 1 games on their own merits in 2022, it’s also fine to not like them. Overall a solid analysis of how they’re incredible games for the time and even have a little bit to offer that modern games don’t have, but I don’t get how your hook and the rest of the video are supposed to fit together."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,My first games were diamond and pearl and I went back and played Pokémon blue when I was 16 and had a great time
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Once, I had a pikachu when I nuzlocked it.

When it reached level 25-26, started evolving. I didn’t use a thunderstone or anything. It just started to evolve"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I was stumped by rock tunnel. To the point where now, about 20 years after playing, I can remember the entire place clearly as if it was somewhere I lived. Because my character basically lived in there for a while."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Hey, what's the credit music name?"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,I can go back and still play Yellow and enjoy it. It's long and tedious but I still enjoy it. These games aren't the best but they will always be a special place in my heart.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,I'm still struggling to do the mew glitch. XD
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"My evaluation are that although the gen 1 games are clearly outdated and some mechanics are strange like: why gust is a normal move type????. But it is worth to play to get knowing how the series started, but if you already played it and just want to experience it again, play FireRed and LeafGreen, it is a much more pleasant and more recognizable to play in the modern age."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Bruh, this chick over here giving me alot to think about, then at 8:50 i lost it, just like i did when i was a kid, i used to wonder what went through Pikachu's head as we spun around like that. Weee!🥰"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"As a kid I used to go through 4 batteries a day playing Gen 1 on my GameBoy. I played it at home, school, church, car...it was the most incredible thing ever. Today I don't think I'd stomach playing the original, but I do enjoy the remakes. Especially the one used for PokéMMO."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,I laughed when you mentioned trial and error as a way to get through the games. My little brother went through rock tunnel completely in the dark because he didn't know where to get HM flash.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,I love how pokemon teaches important lessons
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Beautiful essay! ❤️
Like I started replaying all the games chronologically this year to build a very specific living dex and this is just the cherry on top of it! You light up the fire with this review 😊!"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I'm 7months late but, nice mouse pad."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Great analysis
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,hell nah those games are archaic and trashy.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"You mention Lapras as a throw away, saying it's too weak without effort. But then say Dragonite is supposed to be a wall that has no weakness to you. Lapras is an ice type, and a strong pokemon in itself, of course it's going to take some effort to train. If they give you a Lapras of contemporary level to you, you can basically sweep the rest of the story up to the league with it. It's a trade off."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,14:32 BUTT!!!
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"You know, I'll be honest: I can have more fun playing through Pokemon Gold/Silver Crystal today than I do trying to play through Sun/Moon (I was able to play through the former but still haven't been able to progress hardly at all in the latter due to the slog of forced tutorial/pseudo dialogue cutscenes). That said, I still have some issues going back to playing Gen 1 as it released (even though I grew up with Gen 1). For me, I think the real dealbreaker for me is the lack of trainer rebattles - having your financial gains locked to either Meowth/Persian Payday spam, battling the elite 4 over and over, or abusing a Missingno glitch to duplicate items to sell is kind of a turn-off for me. It makes someone like me, that tends to hoard resources, have a lot less fun and less tempted to experiment coming back to these games. Plus not being able to rebattle trainers at all is just kinda boring, you're basically stuck with the elite 4 or wild battles. Back in the day, this wasn't as big of an issue as you had link battles to battle your friends, but these days it really doesn't hold up well (which GSC definitely improved on with being able to call and rebattle some trainers). I also think one thing you may not have touched on a lot is movesets, the movesets in older games are very bare bones and actively push you away from using some Pokemon (bug types were SUFFERING for the longest time). 

That said, in terms of an initial playthrough, it's still got a lot of fun to offer if you go into it with your expectations tempered. I don't get the urge to replay the originals often, but those rare times I do tend to be pretty fun with some great music. I also really liked your insight into a child's perspective when playing these games, I definitely recall experiencing a lot of those same feelings you touched on. Thanks for the video!"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,My siblings and I still have red blue and yellow. Good times 😌
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,For me Gen 1 and 2 are the best Editions i´ve ever played and - most likely - ever will play
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Gen 1 all the way!  You nailed this review.  It's always fun coming back to the OG games.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,I wish there was like a pkmn master mode:  trainer and wild pkmn levels are higher and if you lose an area you have to go back to the Pokemon Center and then repeat the dungeon. With all of the trainers reset.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I've got to say your newest pokemon reviews are some of my favourite videos on the internet. The way you actually take a new approach on reveiwing them is lovely, and I think they really capture what's special about the games."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Waddup homie . 
What if there was a pokemon theme game exactly like no man's sky on playstation 4"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,What a great review. You touched on some points that I haven't heard in any other retrospectives. Very good and novel information.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,This is game is buggy then what about BDSP?
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I disagree! The OG games were brilliant! 😂 They were really broken though. This is where I started with Pokémon. The Red Version is where I started. Ahhh...the smell of nostalgia. I still play Red and Blue to this day and if I want more modern graphics, I'll play Leaf Green and Fire Red. What other game lets you beat up other kids pets for money, gamble in a casino, wonder a graveyard...and single handedly take on the Mafia...as a kid! 🤣"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,What an eloquent and comprehensive view all-encompassing of the time that it was developed in most of us have been gifted with our ability to think I systems that we don't recognise today or that we recognise incorrectly as poor design. You've done this era justice
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Yes.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,the answer? No
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Proud and huge RBY fan! Yes I can be lured in 100% of the time with out fail.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Considering i've been playing Yellow recently and having a blast, i'm sure Red and Blue also still hold up really well."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,The first Generation was buggy like a Bethesda game.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I’m 31, and gen 1 will always have a special place in my heart. Pokémon blue was my first game ever"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"You know, this video made me kinda glad i grew up super poor. For context my mom could never really afford games and things like that for me and my brother. And when ever we got something it was normally a hand me down from a cousin or extended family. While growing up all the kids i knew we're talking about ruby and sapphire and i felt pretty bad because i read the pokemon manga and watched the anime all the time, hell in the dvd age i was still watching the vhs tapes of Pokemon lol. Anyways for my like 8th birthday i got pokemon yellow on a gba and i fell in love i had this genuine puzzle solving experience all the other kids never really had with yellow. Hell i still remember getting yelled at for playing pokemon past bed time with a flashlight and trying to explain that to my classmates who didnt understand why my screen wasent lit up. Honestly im glad i couldn't have all the new things when i was a kid because i would have missed out on older experiences that shaped my early life, thanks pokemon i will always love you."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"That’s a trick question, they were never good.

Lol im just kidding. These games are classics despite the bugs"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Kanto is goated but I’d rather just play Fire Red or Let’s go Pikachu
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Your analysis of the themes of Pokémon really helped me realize and appreciate what made the games so comforting and real to me as a kid. Thank you.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Wow! I totally forgot about this channel. Cool to see you again
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I played Yellow about a month ago and it resparked my enjoyment for pokemon better than Y, Sword, or Ultra Moon. 

Now IDK If I'd ever play it again, because it definitely wasn't the most enjoyable game, but it was functional and fun, and more engaging than most of the current games."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,For me as a kid pokemon was hard because it was not available in my language.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,I'd just have made it a 2 second video saying yes
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,wtf when did tama come back?
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,If you think hen 1 is the worst of pokemon ur trash lol easily the best with gen 2 being a close 2nd
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,some people on twitter told me these beloved classics are outdated and sadly called let's go the definitive kanto experience when it has Pokemon Go mechanics and bad motion controls to compliment that gameplay.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"The fact that upu can get a mew, puts it above fire red for me."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"hello yes I have read your comments about how psychic type weaknesses are based around common phobias, thank you very much I definitely missed that, please don't spam me with that thank you for watching"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"You can get mankey to smash Brock from where you meet the royal for your second fight, means charmander is always viable starter. Butterfree is OK too but is a bit frail"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Dude, why you didnt catch a menki (sry, dont know his english name)? It is east of the second twon (where you find the pkmn league and fight against your rival)."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Can't you catch a mankey before fighting brock?
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"One feature introduced in Pokemon Yellow that we still use today is the introduction of friendship and happiness. Although very rudimentary at that time and was restricted to Pikachu, I think It’s worth noting. Something so real and natural as being able to see how a pokemon feels towards you was introduced as early as gen 1. I find it remarkable. No wonder this game is a timeless piece. I enjoyed this video very much. I’ll keep watching the rest. P.s. Would love to see the remakes retrospectives as well. Great channel"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,I'll forever feel so lucky to be around when all this started. It created so much magic in my childhood.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"6:41 or you bought the strategy guide which came out at around the same time as the games. And there was plenty of internet info back then due to forums and some specific websites. Bulbapedia might've not been around, but that doesn't necessarily mean the internet wasn't."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Thanks to this video, I found out that mankey being on route 22 is a yellow version addition. I remember struggling with Charmander but couldn't remember why since I thought mankey was always on route 22. Woops"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"It's interesting to hear how large the install base of the Gameboy supposedly was. No-one I knew owned a Gameboy....until Pokémon happened. Then, everyone did."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Nidoran male- double kick = bye bye brock
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"For a first time Gen 1 playthrough, do you recommend Pokemon Yellow via 3DS eShop or Fire Red / Leaf Green via Emulator/Homebrew?

I'd love to see anime references, but if the cons outweigh the pros for Yellow then I'm willing to go for FR/ LG instead, assuming emulators or homebrew can run it well."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,i love your series
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Psychic is weak to Bug because Bug type is best type.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Think you are overlooking that Charmander can just body onix with some potions. Ember negates his high def, even if it's not effective it chunks. Also if you get the burn off, drops onix to a meager degree. You are negative here about the ""wall"" but it's meant to teach you about big gap in special stat I guess."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Disagree that charmander kills you in the early game. I like to pick bulbasaur but even butterfree sweeps through brock with confusion.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I finally caught all 151 Pokémon in Blue, with the assistance of the Mew Glitch. I r decided to move onto Gold and complete that for the first time ever. If only there were an easy way to get Celebi easily 😫"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"This game basically saved the Gameboy from going under like the Sega Gamegear. I think GameFreak's biggest mistake was not just creating their own handheld console exclusively for Pokemon. Because lord knows the Gameboy, Gameboy Advance and even the 3DS were seen exclusively as Pokemon machines for a generation of people. I never bought a single game other than Pokemon on any of them."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"41:51 Nidoran♂ also learns Double Kick at lv. 12 in Yellow, giving you one more attack you can use against Brock"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,R&B is the only Pokémon game I’ll ever play
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,I remember the Cinnabar mansion being absolute hell
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Pshycic is weak to bug because this was a great video
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Lol is that Drake Bell in that 2nd commercial?
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,This is just one long complaint lol
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,so speed runners use nido  male for double kick also charmander has no issue against brock due to the lack of special stat or non existence of special def stat
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Bro still hasn't made remake retrospectives
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Pokémon was so much more magical without the Internet as easily accessible and filled with deep knowledge on everything almost immediately. 

I helped spread the rumor about pikabluein my school. 

I helped spread the rumor about mew in my school. 

We had fun with it. It was magic."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,The fact that I remember this commercial 0:08 and saw it on tv. All the time. When it was new. Makes me feel so old reading the comments
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Everything about modern Pokémon IS BAD.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Does nobody realise how strong Charmander's ember is against Brock's Onix? I mean I figured it out 20+ years ago but it doesn't seem like anyone else has.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,5:05 ah yes as we know the gameboy sold over 36 units world wide
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Among my favorite changes made to Fire Red was that they teach charmander a steel type attack to give fire trainers a chance
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I'm multitasking whilst I watch, so maybe I missed something, but isn't Mankey available to catch before the first gym?
Fighting beats rock and Mankey and Primape are dope fighting types, or at least they are in Leaf Green anyhow."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,I'm a little late to the party... But I'd like to add that P. Yellow fixed the color schemes (somewhat) for the overworld. Back then this was quite the improvement.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I know Pokémon Red and Blue had limited inventory space, but couldn’t you store items in the PC?"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"fun fact about psychic, all its weaknesses are related to the most common phobias. spiders/bugs, darkness, and ghosts. thats how i remember it. then fighting weakness is brains over brawn, and steel resistance to psychic is ""steeling the mind"". and the strength against poison is mind over matter."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"psychic is weak to bug and dark types because those are some basic human fears, knowing how the idea of having psychic abilities originated from people having those powers and not pokemon or animals, i think its pretty clever, also i know you already know this im just saying how its a pretty cool idea"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,22:00 What do you mean? You can level Charmander easily in viridian Forest
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,you missed jinx at psychic user
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"The thing is, growing up with these games, this was all there was for what felt like years, the idea of more than even 150/151 playable Mons was a daydream for someday in the future. In the meantime, this game gave me so much joy, there was no other game quite like it (red or blue, same thing). I love that the franchise has kept going and doing new things, but to me the best thing any of these games can do, especially for the youngest fans, is inspire imagination and a fascination with but not limited by the real natural world."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"if they don't go back to this, Pokemon will actually be done soon i guess. No one wants 3D Pokemons. except for stadium"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Onix is definitely designed to be your first boss fight. You meet a giant rock snake and the only way to really hurt it is by using a special move. That drives you to use your stab moves. 

For Charmander you just growl him while he's charging up bide and then ember him on his release turn. It's just slightly more strategy."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,What a virgin nerd
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,If you start with charmander then you have to pick up mankey by viridian city on the path by the pokemon league.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I believe nidoran male (idk if the female learns this) learns double kick, which helps immensely with Brock. Not sure if this was universal in all 3 starting games"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"You’re wrong about charmander in the early game. Because of Brock’s awful special stats, ember can get you through it quite easily without having to grind much at all"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I could have sworn you could catch Mankey on Route 22 west of Viridian to help against Brock... but it turns out that's just in Yellow Version. Oops.

That said, Charmander's fire moves being Special-based actually offsets Onyx's resistance to fire somewhat: his defense against Special is just that bad. So Charmander isn't a TOTALLY lost cause there."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Thinking back to my very first play through when I was like 6 years old, going into Brock’s gym with just a Charmander."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Awesome video KingK!
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"The only pokemon games I've ever liked were the first 2 and their remakes. It's safe to say that I'm not anywhere close to their target market anymore. The new games, to me, don't even feel Pokemon anymore. Idk."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Pokémon red and blue were perfect back when I was a kid. Back then I didn’t even understand stats, didn’t pay any attention to a Pokémon’s attack and defence levels and didn’t even know about STAB or anything like that. It was perfect and there was nothing to compare it to. Later on improvements were made but red and blue built that foundation"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,I was literally the only kid I knew with the original pokemon smh that trend has continued to now none of my friends play pokemon its easier to trade now so it's no big deal but I hated the whole two game thing when I was a kid
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"In addition to Mankey, I think Nidoran learns double Kick at 12 in yellow, giving another option against Brock."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,I will say the first time I did a Pokemon Blue run through with Charmander I had an epic battle with Brock where I used sand Attack a bunch of times with Pidgey and barely won using Charmander and ember.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"So in reality the first games were sh!t, sure it was fun but gen 1 was my least favourite gen"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Here at 1,049,871 views. (before that too... maybe)"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,You have your generations confused. I'm Gen X and still have my original Gameboy from high school.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I would say one thing - when I was growing up in the 90s, we didn't actually have to guess much. The prima guides for R/B/Y were everywhere and almost every kid I knew had an internet connection and could access Gamewinners, Gamefaqs etc. for an hour or two every night.

Trading was very important though. I remember getting a copy of red to go with my copy of blue and my friends at the time asked me to restart a few times so I could trade out the starters people were missing (which were extremely limited back then). Also I was the only one in my group who was good/lucky at the safari zone and game corner, so I'd constantly be trading those out regardless of whatever version someone else had. R/B/Y era had a lot of this because you couldn't simply breed to recreate a species you already had. G/S/C's breeding mechanics definitely cut out a lot of the trading you had to do (but it was still cool because now you could send items to other players)."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,I feel dumb for getting into this now as an adult
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"The Brock Hard Wall was VERY true to my experience as a kid. I only got Red after my younger brother got his Yellow version and my parents learned that there was only one save file, so we couldn't share the game as easily. What that meant is that I obviously picked Charmander since I wanted an awesome Charizard like the one on the cover (still my favorite Charizard artwork to this day) and Brock obviously kicked my teeth in while I watched my brother sort of cruise by Brock because Nidoran learned Double Kick on Lv12 but ONLY in Yellow. I'll never forget how envious I was at that moment. Another thing I distinctly remember is how I was dreaming of catching my very own team and have a partner as tight as Pikachu in the anime. I would often daydream about things like these relating the series I currently had on my mind, but Pokemon stuck - I still remember those. Funnily enough, I actually *did* find a mon that fit the description. I ended up adoring Farfetch'd - the one you can trade for in Vermilion City. I'd always trade for that little guy and take him all the way to the Elite 4. With Farfetch'd and Charizard, I had some glaring weaknesses (I'd rarely get past Loreley) but I remember loving those two a LOT.

The not so fun memories were tons of corrupted save files. We'd always play Pokemon together with the kids from next door but we had to promise to do it outside (because playing outside > playing videogames, obviously, so it was a compromise). It turns out, those cartridges don't endure heat very well. They don't take permanent damage from lying in the sun, but apparently they do lose the save data on them. I lost SO many Farfetch'd to the sun. It was always very tragic. I must have restarted the game dozens of times.

Nowadays, I actually still replay Red, though by now, it's the VC version. In some ways the wonkier things about Gen1 make it really fun to me. Farfetch'd actually is useful, being the earliest learner of STAB Slash and critting with it 90% of the time. The balance issues of sleep and wrap allow pokemon like Arbok or Parasect to really shine despite their awful stats (Arbok being able to paralyze with Glare is especially evil). In a way, the mucked up balance allows mechanics to outshine stats in many cases. Sometimes, I get really in the mood for stuff like this."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,The Manaphy egg thing reminded me that me and my friend were thoroughly convinced that Keldeo was hidden at the end of the Abyssal Ruins in BW and spent hours finding how to get deeper into the ruins only to find a bunch of treasure instead. Good times when we were kids
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Hope you will be continuing this retrospective series soon. Can't wait to hear your opinion and whatnot on all newer generations, particularly X & Y."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"*I guess you could say psychic was BUGGED during Generation 1 😏*

it's fine I'll see myself out."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,It's this crap that causes people problems
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"22:12, the purple one is male because it later evolves into Nidoking"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Me with my Red mono poison team. Nidoking takes on all challenges!
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Dude Mantine Surfing was awesome
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Fun fact: it was actually Shigaru Miyamoto who suggested splitting the games into 2 version to get people to trade together.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,The soundtrack alone gived me goosebumps.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,I feel like the grind was all In our heads … today I replayed red beat Brock without grinding once I lvled a metapod to 10 got confusion via buttfree and beat Brock ez pz all by trainer battles and the occasional wild encounter no huge grinds
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Playing through Red version and watching the Indigo league episodes just for the novelty
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,I TOTALLY brute forced Brock with my Pikachu as a kid on my first playthrough. in yellow Pikachu learns slam when it would thunderbolt in red and blue I want to say level 20 or 26 idk anyway I grinded Pikachu until it learned slam and used slam to win.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,gen 1 only have 5 ice types isn't a big deal. just by story progression you get Laura's and most people at least have articuno you don't really need any more than that in gen 1
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Nidoran can learn double kick to help with Brock if you chose Charmander
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,This may be a hot take but I didnt mind psychic being broken in gen 1. It made fights more interesting than picking a direct counter. I remember teaching my Ninetails body slam bc it seemed to do decent against Sabrina's pokemon and the paralysis chance helped. It's more fun to craft a strategy and succeed than just run in with a dark type imo. Besides that great video! Agree with many of your points even though gen 1 will always be great in my eyes
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"""Don't expect a finely balanced experience""? ""Practically impossible""?
Sorry, but that's just not true; there are ROM hacks out there that _literally_ achieve that just by changing trainer levels and which wild Pokémon you encounter in which areas. It's _very_ possible, Game Freak just traditionally wasn't ever good at doing it."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Is mankey before the first gym yellow only?
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Why didn’t you do a yellow version retrospective as well
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Part 1 - 2:17
Part 2 - 9:25
Part 3 - 21:24
Part 4 - 45:23
Part 5 - 40:26"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"these two games are my childhood,
even my mom would play it too! 
i was so sad when my dog chewed up my pokémon red cartridge 😭 it was a sad day"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I know this is way past due, but I forgot to mention it when i frist saw the video. Since rewatching once again I wanted to metion this. The psychic type feels like ti represents humans. People are mostly scared of bugs, ghosts and the dark. the same aplies to its strengths. We tend to avoid fights with atguments and discussion and we understand and remove toxic things from our lives."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Your Pokémon retrospective videos are some of my favourite videos on YouTube! I always watch them when I want to relax :)
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Red and Blue are Kind of FNAF:SB a Bug riddled mess that tried super hard and was just way too overambitious.  I'm glad they did even if Modern game freak and nintendo have less than savory buisness practices.  I overall think red and blue are the worst in series By far simply due to their technical ineptitude.  They get like a 3-4/10 from me because they still have some nostalgic value for people who actually lived when the game first came out, but other than that there is very little good reason to ever play through kanto. THe designs of a lot of Mons are subpar and far more are way more lazy than modenr pokemon designs people still complain about.  I love the pokemon franchise, but Kanto specifically gets way too much attention considering  How incredibly poorly optimized the original games were, and how many of the pokemonm from the original 151 have pretty forgettable and uninteresting designs, only propped up by the fact theyre Kanto pokemon and have been around the longest.  Gens 3-7 Have amazing Designs with 2 and 8 being a bit more inconsistent. You can call it a bias inherent due to the obscene amount of attention Kanto gets, but thats exactly why I dont like pretty much anything from Kanto Anymore.  It's been shoved down our throats so hard that designs I was mostly neutral for in the past I've started to really hate.  I was never big on Charizard, but I have started to hate it as it gets new forms and shit tons of attention because I simply don't care much for it and its design is so basic and bland that it getting this much attention is so clearly nostalgia bait people with no brain could see it. 

Sigh.  I have an Irrantional Hatred of Kanto specifically."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,The felling you got when you swam from cinnabar to pallet the first time blind was crazy
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Genwunner propaganda  jk
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,We’ve come so far in the Pokémon games.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,15:30 and Mew
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,2:22 is that Drake Bell?
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Sandshrew is based on the pangolin rather than the armadillo
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,My first Pokemon game was Red & Blue. Looking back on it now... jeez those were such good times.
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxLYuyaMQZI&ab_channel=MudButteFilms
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,why is nobody talking about drake bell being in that pokemon commercial
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I hate those old heads who swear to GOD and back that the old pokemons where so hard. Nah fam, you just sucked back than lol  every pokemon can be made ultra easy if you know how the type match ups work. Dorks man."
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"I love the vid though I can actually touch on a few things
The weaknesses of psychic are a direct result of fear or possession (or even both) thats why ghost and bug can be so strong to psychic, others like fairy being weak to steel is due to mythos, fighting being strong to dark is the classic good vs evil, hell steel resisting psychic in later gens is a funny thing cuz it references conspiracy theory stuff where you can block psychic signals with tin foil hats

Edit: on another point: the nidos are actually the best option due to double kick for early game, though in terms of late game butterfree can be quite strong, just not competitively"

Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,*GREATEST GAMES EVER CREATED*
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,"Easy- bulbasaur, easy- squirtle, OR GRIND UNTIL IT BECOMES EASY- charmander. 

Me, who will always pick charmander: you’re god damn right 💪"
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,The first 10 seconds of this video gave me a nostalgic trip that really hit me hard!
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Interesting look into the game where it all started. I didn’t visit kanto until the first remakes came out on the gameboy advance. It’s amazing so many people got through this game despite how apparently tedious and difficult it can be to the lay person
Pokemon Red/Pokemon Blue,Pokémon Gen 1 was a drug…plain and simple.
