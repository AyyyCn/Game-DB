Return of the Obra Dinn,"So i have played obra dinn:

1. Do you like these types of puzzles? https://www.brainzilla.com/logic/logic-grid/thanksgiving-dinner/

2. Now imagine doing that type of puzzle while getting to freely explore a crime/death scene in first person. You must solve their identity and cause of death. You also get to listen to dialogue, look at documents, check out the background of the scene for each death.

If that sounds cool you will love the game.

Edit: if you buy the game note that if you leave the ship before you are done you are ending the game and cannot go back."
Return of the Obra Dinn,Thanks for the feedback! I do enjoy those!
Return of the Obra Dinn,Great to hear hope you enjoy when you get around to it
Outer Wilds,"Can't say anything about OuWi, but Sekiro is brutally difficult. Even for FromSoftware, which is known for Dark Souls and Elden Ring, this is said to be the hardest game of them all."
Outer Wilds,"outer wilds was the most delightful and touching mystery/exploration games ive ever played and must be passed down as one of the greats of storytelling. i havent played sekiro but if you like the other fromsoft games it should be more of that but different enough with that posture mechanic.  
as for hogwarts legacy, my gut tells me its going to be meh. while those other two are known to be beloved.   
of course it's up to you in the end, but the last few years of AAA gaming have drilled the lesson into us to not to buy any game for the first few months after release, until they actually finish the game"
Outer Wilds,"Hogwarts legacy won't be out until February of next year so it's impossible to give a legitimate recommendation when no one has ever even played it. If you're trying to only pick one or the other you're just gonna have to wait until the game (HL) comes out and see what reviewers say, otherwise just get outer worlds/sekiro since they are out this second."
Outer Wilds,Outerwilds
Outer Wilds,"I have played two fromsoft games (elden ring and bloodborne. I loved learning the mechanics of bloodborne (my first fs game) even though i struggled a lot during the early game. I didn't struggle as much in elden ring but i still liked it. So if sekiro can give the same feeling bloodborne gave, i would most likely love it"
Outer Wilds,"Yeah maybe you're right + hogwarts legacy will only get cheaper after release while these games are already ad cheap as they can be. So i think i will buy outer wilds and sekiro instead, thanks a lot for your advice"
Outer Wilds,Yeah that's actually a really good advice but the thing is idk if the black friday sale prices would be repeated in early 2023 or for how much these games usually go on sales (the usual ones). Otherwise i have no problem waiting
Outer Wilds,"I didn't play BB, but i did hear that base game is on the easier end of difficulty, with DLC cranking it up.

Elden Ring, depending on how you played it, can be either easiest or hardest one.

I think you will love Sekiro, if you liked BB's combat. Just swap the dodge for block. Unless attack shows red, you can block it, no matter how unblockable it looks"
Outer Wilds,"Yeah, sekiro's combat also looks quite great, i think i will go for ow and sekiro, thanks a lot man"
Celeste,"Depends on the kind of game you're into, besides being a 2d pixel games they're very different.

Celeste is a platformer that can be really challenging but the saves are super forgiving which keeps it from becoming frustrating and the ""feel"" is spot on, it isn't a crazy long game at like 8ish hours, but the story has a lot of heart and it is an extremely fun game imo.

Terraria is a survival game that has \*tons\* of content, like 10s to 100s of hours, it can be a little slow to get into but once you get over the initial hump it can keep you hooks for quite some time. It also has multiplayer which may be a factor if you have friends that you want to play with. It's not exactly comparable to Minecraft but that is a common comparison if that means anything to you. It can give you some challenge, but it isn't too tough.

I'd say Celeste is an example of a perfect platformer. Terraria is the best time sink for your money."
Celeste,"Both games are great so you can't really go wrong with either. However, I definitely have more hours on Terraria through multiple playthroughs and the presence of some really well made content mods (with more to come since the mod loader was recently updated to the most recent major patch)."
Celeste,Idk why you’d buy for honor instead of all 3 of the others personally
Celeste,Terraria managed to become my most played game due to is simple yet complete nature at time. Can’t go wrong with it and there’s also a big modding community and a terraria 2 in the works
Celeste,"I vote for celeste.    
It is hard, challenging but is a very fast game ( if you die, you can retry instantly)    
artstyle is beautiful the game is very wholesome."
Celeste,"celeste is the ultimate challenge, personally I prefer it"
Celeste,"I ended up buying celeste and borderlands 2 goty and borderlands 3.  
Thanks for the recommendations."
Celeste,I much preferred Celeste.  Terraria scratched the same itch that Minecraft scratched better.
Celeste,"Personally, I liked Terreria a whole bunch. Much more absorbing than I thought. Didn't care for Celeste much; thought it was overrated and frankly boring."
Celeste,"I would say terraria. I have hundreds of hours over the years but always come back. Do not let the 2D style trick you, this is a complete and challenging game with some of the most satisfying boss fights of any game."
Celeste,"I'd definitely say terraria, celeste is a good platformer but terraria has so much more to it and you could get a lot more fun out of it in the long run"
Celeste,"The game should be fun,story rich and should offer lots of content. My friends arent going to play terrarria so if there arent any public servers i wont be able to play multiplayer"
Celeste,ok
Celeste,Because i want a 3d pvp  fighting game thats not too expensive
Celeste,alright
Celeste,alright
Celeste,Did you beat terraria? Like ever?
Celeste,Uh wat
Celeste,terraria is not at all the same type of game as minecraft. Maybe a modpack for minecraft could do it but terraria's main appeal is not found in vanilla minecraft much
Celeste,"Terraria is just fine to play on your own. It barely has a story though. For story, Celeste is way better. If you enjoy challenging platformers, Celeste also has plenty of content, but Terraria definitely has more."
Celeste,"Neither are particularity story rich, Celeste more so, but terraria’s got that lore"
Celeste,"Are there still people playing for honor ? Check that out before buying it, they lost a fair amount of players those last years."
Celeste,No.
Celeste,"Agreed. Minecraft has more in depth building in terms of switches and automation type stuff while I’m 3D and terraria has more combat and progression similar ish to a single player game but still has a ton of building elements but in 2D.

If I just want to build mostly I’d pick Minecraft. If I want to have some progression, combat and maybe some light to medium ish building."
Celeste,"I’d recommend giving it another run through, when did you try it? To me I’d place the base game (without servers) above minecraft"
Celeste,yeah terraria is more an adventure game while minecraft focuses on the sandbox elements
Hades,Hades is definitely worth playing. On top of easily having 100+ hours of replay value if you're a completionist.
Hades,Hades
Hades,"Hades,hades,hades.


Seriously though they're different games. Ones a survival,crafting game and the other is a roguelite. Choose what you feel like playing or get both"
Hades,"7 Days is a weird game. It looks really good on the surface but if you dive a bit deeper it's a very mediocre game. The core gameplay loop is fun, but you'll soon realize that's all the game has to offer and it gets really repetitive. It has improved a lot, but updates are too slow, there are far too few devs working on it and at this point I don't think it will ever get the treatment it needs to feel like a complete game.



Hades is a masterpiece of writing. It was the first video game to win a Hugo Award in 2021. It's really that good. Gameplay-wise, I love roguelikes but I know it's not for everyone. It's hard and punishing at first but once you understand some mechanics it's very fair. Also, if it really bothers you, you can turn easy mode on and enjoy the story.



In short: If you can only get one, go with Hades. 7 Days is a maybe if you have some money to spare and don't mind playing a fun but unfinished game."
Hades,"Hades is great, I played it 35 hours during the first week and now I can't turn my head around due to my bad posture, 10/10."
Hades,"u/xMadruguinha made some great points and this is to add to that a bit. 

7 Days becomes pretty limited pretty quickly due to how slow the updates are and how poorly optimized it is. 

OP, to give you an insight on its optimization and pace of content; 7 Days To Die was released as an alpha in DECEMBER 2013. It is now June, 2022 and the game remains in alpha. A lot of people still defend the pace and quality of content, but take a look at the most recent alpha 20 and you’ll see how insignificant their changes were - and this one was actually a big one relative to their alpha releases. It’s hard to justify the price tag that comes with this game off of just concept alone. Not to mention how ridiculously unstable it is. Also one thing to note, while mod makers are amazing people, even the mods for this game leave it lacklustre when it comes to the actual gameplay. One final thing I want to point out here is that the developers aren’t bad at all, they’re actually wonderful. Their issue is how understaffed they are and how their resources may be limited from the higher-ups. 

Hades is definitely a good game and after having played both I can say it’s 100% worth the money. If it’s not something you want even after the recommendations that’s totally okay, but even then I’d still recommend holding off from 7 Days. And this is coming from someone with over 113 hours in that game."
Hades,"Might be not relevant but 7 days to die is currently on the xbox ultimate PC pass.   
Not trying to sound like an add, but first month of the PC only xbox ultimate is 1$.   
Maybe try the game through that and see if you think it is worth it.   
(Just make sure you cancel the xbox sub if you don't want to pay going forward.)"
Hades,Get Gamepass and play both.
Hades,Game pass is your answer
Hades,"Curve ball try Project Zomboid, I have 7 Days and played the hell out of it in early access but Zomboid has really sucked me in. I play it like a rogue like and it is a solid time with a lot of depth. 

I played Hades and liked it but kind of fell off. YMMV"
Hades,7 days is good. Never even heard of hades
Hades,"Depends what game style you enjoy more. Do you like 3D zombie survival with resource management? Or do you like a 2D roguelike dungeon crawler with extensive build customisation options? If the former, 7DTD. If the latter, Hades."
Hades,Hades
Hades,"Hades is better, but both are good. I would get hades then get 7 when on sale or something"
Hades,Hades is honestly 10/10; they got literally nothing wrong.
Hades,Hades 100%
Hades,You can try both games through XBOX game pass for 1 euro for 3 months (:
Hades,Thank you
Hades,Thanks helped a lot I still think I will go with 7 days to die as I will be able to get hades soon but your message has made me reconsider. Do you know of any other good games below 40$?
Hades,Another reason I wanted to get 7 days to die is because of there new map gen system and how it greatly increases replay value
Hades,"So is Hades, I believe."
Hades,Thank you :)
Hades,"Go with your heart then, 7 Days is still a fun game if you can look past that stuff and the community is really nice too! My main issue with it was just optimization and late-game content. 

Based off of some of the games from your list and my own preference here’s a few that I really enjoyed and maybe you would too:

Valheim 10/10 - amazing game, and at $22.79 CAD it’s a steal. 

V Rising 8/10 - this game JUST came out like last week or so (which is why I didn’t give it a 10 because I want to see what it’s like when the initial player base hype goes down a little) but it already has a big community and the concept is really great.  It a vampire themed open world ish survival game that has pvp and pve. Think of rust and valheim put into one. Also priced at $22.79 CAD. 

Lost Ark 10/10 - this one isn’t based off your list but I personally just love it so I’m putting it here. It’s free to play and progress but be careful it can potentially turn you into a cash cow for them. 

Total War Warhammer 2 10/10 - I absolutely loved this game, playing as skaven was one of the best things ever. This one and the new one are over $40 however if you can get this on sale under $40 at any point I’d say do it. 

Old School RuneScape 10000/10 - this game has ruined me since I was a child. You simply do not quit this game. If you didn’t play this years ago you may feel it’s a bit outdated and may not totally understand the feel and obsession people have with it. It’s free but it’s not worth it, the membership is where the game actually is. That is about I think near the $20/month range but you can buy membership with in-game gold so on average people only buy the membership once or twice."
Hades,"The new map generation is its strongest point, the cities it creates are one of a kind. One thing I'll recommend is mods or learn to mod the game (it's the easiest modding I've ever seen). Find a guns too weak changed it, want explosions to destroy stuff done, more zombies done, or bigger/more cities no problem. 

There's lots of mods on ""7daystodiemods.com"" too but I don't touch any of the overhauls since I find them a little silly. One mod I'll recommend that makes a small but huge difference to make the world feel alive is corpses don't dissapare.   They never disappear until harvested, got a server with thousands of bodies in a city."
Hades,"It does help for sure, but personally I don’t think it solves the shallow gameplay loop problem. I am glad they added that in though"
Hades,"Yes, it is."
Hades,Thank you so much I think I will go with v rising or valheim as I had a few hours in the game 7months or so ago which one do you think I should get if I could only get 1
Hades,"Valheim is amazing, +1"
Hades,For sure man! Just make sure to check your system requirements before buying to be on the safe side
Hades,I checked I can run both which one do you recommend
Disco Elysium,"If you like good writing, this is the best writing you’ll find in games. Nothing else like it’s mastery of tone. And if you LOVE good writing, you will remember this forever."
Disco Elysium,"You have to adjust your expectations going in and keep an open mind.

If you love RP-ing while gaming and you love good writing. Boy, there is no way to oversell this game."
Disco Elysium,"Everyone raves about this game. I have my own feelings about it but one thing you should know, is it's weird. There is a lot of world to get into here, and a lot of it makes no sense at first. There are a lot of little voices that talk in your head and make your personality and it can all be a little strange. I wasn't quite prepared for how weird the game is at first, so just be aware of that"
Disco Elysium,"I went into it super uninformed about whatever the hell it was like, I ended up really enjoying it, it’s akin to playing a tabletop RPG with dice. Pretty much every decision is based off of how well dice are rolled, it’s really hard for me to describe because of how I’ve never played anything like it before, but I loved the story, and you also get to punch a kid in the face as hard as possible so it was instant GOTY material"
Disco Elysium,"Disco Elysium is like on the other end of the spectrum from Elden Ring. Where Elden Ring is very combat-focused, with little exposition, Disco Elysium is very exposition-based, with no actual ""combat"" per-se (everything is based on ""rolls"" and decisions you make). The things both of these games have in common are that they are critically acclaimed, and that they have excellent writing and voice acting.

Disco Elysium reminds me of old-school point-and-click adventure games, but with more of a focus on decision-making and dialogue, instead of ""solving puzzles"" if that makes sense. I wouldn't classify it as an RPG. It's an Adventure game, with some RPG mechanics.

The game can be absolutely hilarious at times. It involves a lot of reading (though fully voice acted), so you kind of gotta be into that sort of thing. If you like graphic novels and making narrative choices in games, this is your jam. There is no ""action"" really. Sometimes the dialogue can feel like it just goes on and on (this is especially true if you start out as a ""Thinker"").

In my opinion, it is easily worth the $20. It's a fantastic game when you're in the mood for something more chill and story-based.

P.S. if you bite the bullet on Disco, I recommend starting as a Sensitive or maybe Physical. ""Thinker"" can be overwhelming with information, and is probably better suited to a second playthrough, IMO. I found ""Sensitive"" to click the most with my actual personality, which made it a lot easier to immerse myself in the world."
Disco Elysium,"Yes, awesome game. Worth $20. Lots of story."
Disco Elysium,I had never played a game of this type/genre before. Bought it on sale. It’s very good and will keep you interested. I finished it in like 2 weeks because I couldn’t put it down. It’s like the strangest murder mystery ever and the voice acting is so good. It’s like a weird true detective game if you have ever seen that show.
Disco Elysium,"Ehhhhh. I love it but it is absolutely not a traditional RPG videogame like the ones you've posted. I'd read the Kotaku review of it if you haven't as it gives a really good overview of what makes it so appealing.

If you don't like lots and lots and LOTS of reading I'd avoid it. If you love reading dialogue, wied play and weird comedy it's absolutely worth playing."
Disco Elysium,Great game but shifty studio
Disco Elysium,"I don't think you can even consider this game to be an RPG in the grand scheme of gaming...I mean it is, but it's not comparable to any other, it's sort of its own category considering the paths of failure."
Disco Elysium,Do it
Disco Elysium,"I've been waiting for this to come on sale in the UK on the xbox.

I stupidly replaced my xbox one with a series S so no disk drive.

Apparently it was on the gamepass as well at one point. I must have completely missed it."
Disco Elysium,Basically a point and click adventure game whetr rolling a dice + your stats decides your choices. It’s exceptionally written with a great story but the lack of control you have hurt it for me. If you’re more “go with the flow” or used to the DnD style you’ll probably really enjoy it.
Disco Elysium,"No, Wasteland 3 is better if you don’t play top down rpgs"
Disco Elysium,If you like reading an absolute ton of text then go for it
Disco Elysium,"Great game, but it’s honestly more like an interactive audiobook"
Disco Elysium,Did you mean The Outer Worlds or Outer Wilds?
Disco Elysium,"It’s a fever dream of a game, I personally refunded"
Disco Elysium,Alright I'm sold. Thank you for your input! It's downloading now.
Disco Elysium,"I started this morning, you could not have been more correct. It's really tripping me out how much this game caters to me specifically, in such niche and obscure ways. From the familiar narrative inner voices and communist rhetoric right down to the mechanics of it all. Organizing your confusing intrusive thoughts, struggling with addiction and health, even the sense of humor and people's reactions to it is identical to my own life, only portrayed in comic book esque hyperbole. What a find."
Disco Elysium,"It's so weird, that I'm unsure as to whether it was a dream or not tbh actually"
Disco Elysium,"Good point. I loved Disco Elysium, the mystery, the psychology, the characters were all so great, but I do think its good to warn people before trying. Ive had friends that cant get into it and find it too weird. I would still suggest most people try the game, but good to keep in mind"
Disco Elysium,"The first thing on my list was Yakuza, those games are chock full of 15-30 minute cutscenes (or just dialogue without animations) in Japanese only. It's got the drama of a soap opera mixed with anime violence and over-the-top ridiculous comedy. Also arguably my favorite series. 

After 8 consecutive Yakuza games I still wanted more, so this sounds right up my alley. I'm a huge fan of tabletop RPGs which someone else compared it to, so it's looking more and more like my next favorite. It's ready to go, I'm just going to finish Elden Ring this week before starting. Thanks for your input!"
Disco Elysium,I have missed some news. Why are they shifty?
Disco Elysium,Does that impact me playing the game?
Disco Elysium,"I know you just meant to say it's super different to any other game that calls itself an RPG, but DE is as ""Role Playing Game"" as it gets."
Disco Elysium,"Only word of advice: Failure in this game is one of the most entertaining things you will ever do. Even if you are sure that you will fail at something, do it if it feels right to you."
Disco Elysium,Have fun with it. Enjoy
Disco Elysium,I was bored out of my mind after an hour..
Disco Elysium,"I absolutely adore this thing dude, glad I could show to someone else and give them a similar feeling. 

Enjoy dude."
Disco Elysium,"You just have to accept that there is nothing. Only warm, primordial blackness. Your conscience ferments in it — no larger than a single grain of malt. You don't have to do anything anymore. Ever. Never ever."
Disco Elysium,In a good way?
Disco Elysium,"Yes! There we go if you love table top RPGs you'll fuckin love it. Just go in knowing it is not an action RPG at all, its all about dialogue and choices and it's genuinely so smart and fun. I love it, so it's a real shame what's happened at the studio"
Disco Elysium,The suits that were funding ZA/UM managed to basically kick the creators of Disco out of the company and destroy their rights to the game.
Disco Elysium,Nope
Disco Elysium,Zero. Some people have a moral stance on it but no I loved the game
Disco Elysium,"Oh I'm certain it'll end up in a gushy review on r/videogames when I'm done haha. Thanks so much for the recommendation, I'm so glad I didn't miss out."
Disco Elysium,The best kind of way
Disco Elysium,"Yeah the whole industry is so predatory these days, especially toward artists. When you read about companies back in the 90s like id software (which was down the street from where I grew up), it was just some friends doing what they're passionate about and the games really showed that. Super creative and very fun. The PC games had a 'boss key' to minimize the game at a seconds notice in case you were playing at work haha. Now with all these mega corporations and their billionaire investors buying all the production companies and working tirelessly to exploit devs and gamers alike."
Disco Elysium,"Ok. Missed that. It is noted for next time. 

Thanks"
Disco Elysium,It's a real shame since we'll probably never see something like the lightning in a bottle that was Disco Elysium by the same crew again because of it.
Hollow Knight,"Story is incredible, although not for everyone, since it's not splashed out in the face of the player, so you need to actively look into it to understand it. Art style is amazing, and sound design in general, not only music, is an absolute joy. Platforming is quite simple, but really well done as well. Unless on challenging areas, where it absolutely becomes MATERIALIZED PAIN.

Seriously, I love a good challenge, but Hollow Knight often times is too much for me. It's a shame, cause I love this game, but maaaaaany bosses and challenging platforming sections were straight up an absolute slog for me, enough to make me forget the game after a while, cause I was not having any fun anymore.

Exploration it's by far THE BEST thing in this game, and I absolutely LOVED TO DEATH to find new areas, enemies and secrets. The combat was ""Meh..."" all the time, with few options and never really making me feel like I was strong enough in many places, although they were the only ones available to be explored at the time.

I love Demon's and Dark Souls, Bloodborne, Sekiro and Elden Ring, and I love the challenge and difficulty in those games, but Hollow Knight is BY FAR much harder in every regard to me. I also honestly think it doesn't have any fun in it's challenges (to my liking), and many stuff in there clearly exists only for the hardcore tryhard fans, although optional and really late game. Still, I like to complete 100% of my games, but I hate being locked out of stuff because I'm not interested in spending 5 hours training on a platforming section. No reward in a game is worth this investment. I also never really liked fighting 2D bosses in general, so no boss in Hollow Knight was good in any way or form to me, but I would say the very same for games like Castlevania, although I like a lot the Metroid ones.

If it's a cheap option, and I do recommend anyone to play it cause it's amazing to see at least some part of it, even if you never intend to finish it (Like myself... But it was worth it all that I've managed to play...) It's a really good game, and really well done. Very unfortunately, it isn't for me...

Another suggestion I make is Dead Cells. Simply amazing, and although rogue like, you can tweak acessibility options to play however you like, in case you're not interested in restarting all of your progress with each death (Like I don't, now and then). It's full of great builds, combat is realy well varied, full of many options, exploration is great, movement is amazing and fluid and the whole game is full of charm. Again, bosses are completely uninteresting to me, but as I stated, I already have problems with bosses in platforming in general...

Sorry for any mistakes, but english isn't my native language. Also, feel free to ask me anything in case you want to know more! I'll gladly answer back!"
Hollow Knight,"Worth the money? It’s gotta be what, like $5-10 on sale? One of the best games I’ve played in the last decade. Expect 40-100 hours first play."
Hollow Knight,Yes
Hollow Knight,"Hollow knight is a great game but only if you enjoy the genre. I can appreciate the art style, the music and the love that went in to producing it, but I hated it. I found it to be a bit repetitive and involved a lot of backtracking. I hate souls like games and metroidvanias and most reviews describe it as a combination of the two. If you enjoy that type of game absolutely go for it. If you don’t, like me, it might be a bit too much. I went for it because it was so highly reviewed, and I took a risk whilst it was on sale. I don’t regret spending the money supporting some clearly talented developers. I wanted to enjoy it, but I just couldn’t. Wasn’t for me."
Hollow Knight,"It's definitely worth the money and an amazing game, some boss fights can be difficult, but I didn't have to try more than 10 times on any of them, most of the time it was first or second try. The platforming / music and world are unique and done very well.

It's also on Xbox game pass for PC (check to make sure as they remove games sometimes), as is the Ori series, which are more platforming based games, I enjoyed them more than hollow kinght but hollow knight is the better of the two overall."
Hollow Knight,"Yeah it's fun and worth it imo. I enjoy metroidvania in general and it's a good one. Tbh the base story isn't overly difficult or anything. All of the incredibly challenging things are near the end of the game, post game, or dlc. You can experience the ""story"" (more of a lore fest without a narrative like Dark Souls) and dodge raging experiences if you really wanted to. I think by that point you'll want to dive into the tough stuff though."
Hollow Knight,"I am not typically a fan of Metroidvania-style games and I just played through HK for the first time because it’s on Game Pass. 

I think it’s one of the best games I’ve played in a decade."
Hollow Knight,lol what a laughable post. Hollow Knight is the best bang for your buck in gaming and the only thing even close is minecraft.
Furi,"If you like games that make you want to take the weapons from the game and repeatedly mutilate yourself with them, then Furi is the perfect game for you."
Furi,"I haven't played Enter the Gungeon, but from what I understand, Furi has similar bullet hell gameplay. However it is also a spectacle fighter, with a basic moveset, and a boss rush (no minions, just boss after boss). Even though actions are basic, there is enough combat flexibility as you have both a melee and ranged weapon, each with alternate attack modes. It is not a rogue-like, as you get three lives and you get to restart a stage even if you die. But the standard difficulty is pretty relentless; and you do get a rating at the end of a playthrough based on how you performed throughout. As you probably already know it's got a stylish aesthetic: cell-shaded anime-esque artstyle, and a pounding European synthwave soundtrack.

A few possible negatives include: relatively short and simple story; boss moves feeling ""scripted"" as there is sometimes only one reasonable counter move; and the controversial ""dash"" mechanic - which activates on release rather than press. This means that many people felt a delay / lag in response, which could lead to some frustrating moments. (The mechanic is there because holding dash extends its range - which becomes necessary in some stages.)

Overall, if you enjoy difficulty, style and have good controller reflexes: get it."
Furi,If you're into really hard stylized games then I would definitely recommend it! It honestly reminds me a lot of Afro Samurai too so if you like that anime and want to feel like a gun-totting samurai badass you should definitely get it!
Furi,"i enjoy short and simple, and i feel that bullet hells are more gameplay than story. thank you, i will definitely be getting this, it seems like the perfect game for me. 

ill also watch out for that dash thingy you mentioned, sounds pretty dumb, so thank you for pointing that out to me."
The Case of the Golden Idol,"*Pentiment* would be my preference, but *Curse of G Idol* is also good - entertaining but not the depth of *Pentiment*. 

Have you also played *Curse of the Obra Dinn* and *Overboard*?"
The Case of the Golden Idol,"Can't tell you anything about Pentiment but I really liked Golden idol. It's oddly satisfying to unravel the mystery of each scene in a fully passive role.

It's quite short though. 
If you've played and liked Return of the Obra Dinn, then I'd definitely recommend. If you haven't you now have a third game to choose from. :D"
The Case of the Golden Idol,Check out Zero Punctuation for pentiment. I find hes good at highlighting big issues with a game. Cheers
The Case of the Golden Idol,"I absolutely loved Obra Dinn, but it’s the first time I hear about Overboard. How long is Pentiment? I read different takes on its length"
The Case of the Golden Idol,Thanks!! I already played Obra Dinn and absolutely loved it
The Case of the Golden Idol,Thanks! I’m usually paranoid about checking zero punctuation with story heavy games because he tends to drop a lot of spoilers
The Case of the Golden Idol,"Perfect - then I would think you'll also like Golden Idol - if you're not put off by the art style. I heard many really hated it.

Both put you in this passive spectator kind of role where you have to make your observations without being able to influence anything directly.

Obra Dinn for me was more amazing from a story perspective but for gameplay and riddles I liked Golden Idol more. Both are good but that would be my take on their strenghts."
The Case of the Golden Idol,"Its definitely a risk since yahtzee doesnt care much about spoilers. I figured I'd suggest him cause i find i agree with a lot of the problems with a game, especially ones i cant put my finger on"
The Case of the Golden Idol,"I know it's probably too late but definitely don't look at the ZP review for Pentiment. It's legitimately one of the worst ones he's done because he legitimately completely missed the point of the game and was frustrated by it. 

Sorry I was looking around here for Golden Idol talk to see if I should get that game and stumbled across this thread."
The Case of the Golden Idol,Thanks for all the info!!
The Case of the Golden Idol,Thanks! At the end I bought Pentiment anyway
SteamWorld Dig 2,"I'm partial to the Shantae series, but they are rather easy and shorter than you'd expect. Steamworld had some decent platforming and a tidy little upgrade system, but that game is also on the forgiving side. So out of these it'd probably be Blasphemous for you, but that's the one I haven't played so that's based on what I've heard."
SteamWorld Dig 2,"Great thank you! Looks like Blasphemous has a demo so I’ll check that out and if I don’t like it, perhaps will grab SteamWorld"
SteamWorld Dig 2,Hope you find a good fit ^.^ Happy gaming!
Stardew Valley,"I can answer some specific questions but overall I would say yes. Its fantastically made, incredibly rich and deep in detail yet not complicated. There is always something to do and it has a decent level of replayability if you ever get to the point that you feel you have ""completed"" your farm. There are pretty consistent updates and a wealth of knowledge between the wiki and subreddit. My only gripe is that it can be a little grindy at times but all of these sorts of games seem to have a little and SDV is no where near the worst."
Stardew Valley,"YES, it's one of the best Game's ever made.
Also the Stradew Valley subreddit is probably the most sweet and welcoming subreddit there is."
Stardew Valley,"Long Answer: Yes.   
Short Answer: y"
Stardew Valley,"I am nearing 200h of gameplay, and it is still interesting. And it had a bigish update recently, I'd say there was never a better time to start with SV.

Top down view is something you get accustomed to very fast, especially since SV is very nicely done and the camera angle really doesn't take much from the experience.

I think game does a really good job of introducing the mechanics. Some thing to emphasize: you gotta water your plants each and every day, fishing is very good source of food and gold early game,  do not plant crops if they are not gonna be ready until season is done, always keep at least one of everything you obtain since NPCs will have random request for all kind of crops, meals, fish..."
Stardew Valley,"Yes. It is a great game - gameplay, challenge, creativity and music are all fantastic. I’ve sunk many an hour into this game."
Stardew Valley,It's an absolute must buy. It's such a fun game.
Stardew Valley,"I've bought it three times (Switch, Mobile, PC) and I'm not a person who does that. You won't regret buying it."
Stardew Valley,Game starts out pretty slow imo but it gets very fun and amazing later when you start expanding your farm.
Stardew Valley,"You should buy Stardew Valley, period. At least once."
Stardew Valley,Yes for sure. You can sink a lot of hours into it. And it just plays well portable.
Stardew Valley,"There's a lot of depth to the game for certain, more than in a Harvest Moon game.  It has most of the elements that Animal Crossing (fishing, collecting fossils and maintaining friendships) but it also has a deep and excellent farming system and a fun mining/combat system.  It's much more objective based than Animal Crossing which is a big plus for me, plus it's not real-time so you can progress more quickly.  I also like that it doesn't punish me for not playing for a while the way Animal Crossing does.  You can spend a ton of hours playing it and it can be laid back or stressful depending on how you choose to play."
Stardew Valley,Yes. Stardew is one of the best games of the last few years. Simultaneously open ended and goal driven. It is super pleasant and so well polished. It has loads of charm and you can tell that so much love went into developing it. It's a game that crosses genres and has appeal to lots of different types of people.
Stardew Valley,The answer to this question is always: YES.
Stardew Valley,Its like animal crossing but good
Stardew Valley,"Yes, it’s a great game. If you’re looking for something more like Minecraft that you can sink hours into, you should also check out terraria"
Stardew Valley,Anyone who replies no to this is simply wrong. Stardew Valley is the perfect game for any kind of gamer and no one will convince me otherwise
Stardew Valley,My most played game on the switch. It’s the best platform for it imo. Having it on the go and handheld makes it so much better.
Stardew Valley,"Yes, extremely fun game."
Stardew Valley,"Yes, bought it a couple of months ago and it's great. There is so much stuff you can do and you get a lot out of it."
Stardew Valley,Personally I prefer graveyard keeper which is definitely similar in many respects. But Stardew valley is good and people like it and the switch port is good.
Stardew Valley,"I absolutely LOVE Starddew on my switch, however, when I bought it I thought, ""I will never need/wat to make edits/hacks on the game..."" and here we are, almost 6 months later, and I WISH I could make just a few little tweaks. Depending on what you like to with your games, I might recommend looking into doing this on your computer rather than Nintendo, BUT if you REALLY want the portability of Nintendo over the hacks then, clearly, go Nintendo.

Clear as mud?"
Stardew Valley,Absolutely! You can't go wrong with Stardew Valley
Stardew Valley,"Yes. I have it on PC as well, but I put many hours and finish almost all the big quests on the switch. I use to play co-op. Makes everything much faster."
Stardew Valley,"It’s so good, definitely worth it"
Stardew Valley,"To all the people saying it's one of the best games ever made, how does it compare to something like Harvest Moon? While many people like HM games, few would consider them top tier titles, so I'm wondering what Stardew Valley does differently."
Stardew Valley,"Given your love of Minecraft, you may also want to check out the Dragon Quest Builders games."
Stardew Valley,What about Terraria?
Stardew Valley,"One of the best value for money games on the market tbh. Even if you don’t like every aspect of the game, you’ll find something you do like."
Stardew Valley,It is the best game to just zone out and vibe to for hours on end. Especially great if you're watching a show on the side too so you can focus on that and keep your hands busy
Stardew Valley,I found it stressfull the first time I played but the second time I played with a couple of friends and it was a lot more fun
Stardew Valley,Yes.
Stardew Valley,1000% yes
Stardew Valley,It’s currently one of my most played games on the switch. It’s a great game just jump in and relax to its great soundtrack while living a nice peaceful life.
Stardew Valley,Yes yes yes yes yes - it’s brilliant
Stardew Valley,"It seems like you’d like if you like Minecraft but here’s my take. 

I much prefer story-driven games (Uncharted, TLoU, etc) but I got Stardew because this question is brought up so much. I started playing and it wasn’t anything special but I chugged along to give it the old college try. It turned out to be pretty fun and an overall chill experience. After a while I got kinda tired of it and decided to move on to another game but before I did I decided to check the hours I logged and I ended up logging about 160 hours. The game was so damn chill that I had no idea that I spent over 6 full days (cumulatively) playing it.

So, yes it’s a fun game and I’d recommend it."
Stardew Valley,"I got it because i was told it was the best game ever. It didnt look like something i would like, but i tried it. Its not for me. I like fps, mmo and racing games. This was very far from those type of games."
Stardew Valley,"Yes but please get it on sale, it's always good to save money"
Stardew Valley,I actually posted about this exact game a while ago and for the time I played it it was a blast. But then I got busy and stopped playing l. But I definitely would suggest the game for those that have the thought of playing it because it’s a good way to destress after a long day or just chill out
Stardew Valley,"A spiritual experience and so enjoyable, not kidding. Buy it immediately"
Stardew Valley,"Switch was built for low Rez games, so go for it"
Stardew Valley,"I suggest this game so much on this subreddit lol, you should get it as it’s pretty good and really customizable to what you like doing in a game.

When you start be sure to turn on hit and place markers as they’re off by default for some reason when they’re pretty damn essential to effectively play."
Stardew Valley,In Stardew Valley I have 8 1/2 days of playtime in one file and I’m still finding new stuff.
Stardew Valley,Yes you will
Stardew Valley,Best 250 hours of my life 👌 it has very much depth.
Stardew Valley,"I like the game but i think buying games on nintendo is a sin, i own a nintendo myself and i only have 1 game in it due to how overpriced the games are there + the store rarely have sales which is stupid yet the fans keep kissing nintendo boot's for it. 

I recommend buying the game from other platforms mainly on steam for laptop/pc. The game can run on low end platform so no need redditor gamer level of a pc just to play the game."
Stardew Valley,"I tried to play it. I tried like it. I couldn't get into it.  

My library system has video games that you can check out.  You might see if yours does too. I checked Stardew Valley out and was able to see that it wasn't for me. Saved me money."
Stardew Valley,Yes
Stardew Valley,Absolutely yes
Stardew Valley,[deleted]
Stardew Valley,"I have it on PC for playing with mods and also on Switch for the ""pure"" experience. It's equally excellent on both platforms."
Stardew Valley,Yes.
Stardew Valley,"Yes it is an amazing game, sunk hundreds of hours on PC, bought it on Switch and my phone as well. Though recently I'm a bit burned out, but still its hundreds of hours of gameplay depends on your pace as well. I started to slow down a lot after >!reaching the bottom of skull cavern.!< Overall 10/10"
Stardew Valley,"I never gave it a chance because it’s 201x. We can do better than pixel art… if the graphics suck so does the game. 

A friend got it for me and I played only to be polite. I’d put an hour or two in and say it’s not for me. Six hours later I need to sleep because I have work in a few hours…. Between Xbox (original), PC and switch I have a few hundred hours now. It’s an amazing game with an amazing dev and an amazing community. 10/10 will buy his next game. 

I also gave games with different art styles a chance because I learned my lesson about judging games by their art."
Stardew Valley,"Yes. I recommend this game most frequently in this sub lol.

Also Owlboy."
Stardew Valley,"Yes, but be warned, you may get a new addiction."
Stardew Valley,"One of my favorite games ever, but I love anything like this."
Stardew Valley,Probably yes. If for some reason you hate it you can rest easy knowing you gave a very good dev money
Stardew Valley,"Absolutely. It’s a charming little indie game that has so much love and care out into it. It was literally made by a single dude too, which is incredibly impressive. The person who made it is also super nice."
Stardew Valley,"If you love Minecraft, then this is A MUST!"
Stardew Valley,"Hmm. I really enjoyed this game for a while. I got it for my whole family so we could play together on PC. I got rather bored of it after about 2 1/2 in game years... My only gripe is the forced sleep, and always feeling like your being rushed to do something because the days are so short. My mother plays it every single day after work, she has over 500 hours in it now. It's NOTHING like Minecraft or other survival crafting games, but it is a decent little farming life simulator. If it's on sale in the store, I say give it a shot. A nice game you might enjoy that kind of splits these two games down the middle is My Time at Portia. Might be a little more expensive than Stardew, but it is much more enjoyable."
Stardew Valley,"I've also kinda been on the fence about buying SDV, but y'all have convinced me."
Stardew Valley,I always love the grind anyway so that’s a positive for me :)
Stardew Valley,"I think the creator said he is done with Stradew valley, so no more updates."
Stardew Valley,Y? Because it's a great game!
Stardew Valley,"Oh, what update?"
Stardew Valley,Same
Stardew Valley,Ios!!
Stardew Valley,"Got it on Switch, Vita, Steam and Android, and i never regretted it once. 

Well i hate the android control, but it's still an amazing game."
Stardew Valley,"Same, I have it on all but my ps4, worth it"
Stardew Valley,But..... you did it
Stardew Valley,Animal Crossing seems to be more about decorating. Stardew is more story driven.
Stardew Valley,"I was going to say no, get it on PC if you can"
Stardew Valley,"I wouldn't say ""No"" as to each their own but ""perfect game"".... hmm.  It may be if you like pixel top-down games but I have no interest in these types of games.   I'm not implying that it's not a good game, I'm sure it is but ""perfect game"" is subjective (like any game).   Now give me Red Dead Redemption 2 or Witcher 3 or Dishonored or Mass Effect and maybe I would then agree :-)  Just saying..."
Stardew Valley,"I love mobile too, pretty well done"
Stardew Valley,"The creator of HM even praised Stardew as the best HM game to come out, and his inspiration for reinvigorating the series."
Stardew Valley,"Stardew Valley is the best Harvest Moon game ever made imo. It doesn’t do anything exceptionally different, it just does everything better."
Stardew Valley,"Pre warning: last Hm game I really played was 64.

I don’t know if it’s when I’m life I played Stardew or what. 
The crafting made it so much more. So many materials you can use for so many cool things. Wine, batteries to power things, products from animals to make cloth or recipes, etc. nothing seemed throw away.
I felt like HM focused on crops and relationships. Stardew has those too but cleaner and more fleshed out. I felt like the characters in SV had depth and more personality then in HM."
Stardew Valley,Stardew Valley is a vastly more rich and complex version of Harvest Moon.
Stardew Valley,I saw you freaking avatar blinked !! Am I crazy ?
Stardew Valley,"Honestly i played the newest Story of Seasons (The real Harvest Moons) and it was amazing, but it lacked the personality and the beauty to beat Stardew Valley. 

SV have better gameplay, better music and the bachelorette (and bachelor) actually have personality. Well most of them at least."
Stardew Valley,"Stardew Valley was inspired by Harvest Moon, but also tried to improve upon its flaws and add in things that were missing. I played HM:MFOMT when I was little, and Stardew Valley as an adult.

Stardew Valley feels rewarding to play. The pacing is excellent and never feels too slow or too rushed. There's more complexity added with the crafting system, and combat adds an extra layer of difficulty/excitement to the game. The atmosphere created by the graphics, music, and sound effects is phenomenal. The pixel art has its flaws, but I prefer SV's more realistic character design over the anime-esque HM characters. I also like the more mature themes presented in the game, but at the same time, the game doesn't take itself too seriously all the time.

SV takes what HM did well and does it even better. I lose track of time as I play it. There's always something to do, but if I want to, it's okay if I just spend the day fishing."
Stardew Valley,Tjose are a lot of fun
Stardew Valley,Yep they are so worth playing for any Minecraft fan.
Stardew Valley,well... yeah... of course it is
Stardew Valley,Thanks for sharing
Stardew Valley,indie games go on sale on the switch all the time. even non indie games go on sale all the time. just check the eshop regularly or check out subs like r/nintendoswitchdeals
Stardew Valley,as far as i know stardew costs the same on switch that it does on steam
Stardew Valley,That’s so funny I’m the exact same I started playing then put the office on my phone hahahaha
Stardew Valley,There a small one coming that might have new content with bugfix. But yea the game wont have any big updates left.
Stardew Valley,"I, too, will inquire as to the nature of the aforementioned update."
Stardew Valley,Truu
Stardew Valley,por que no los dos
Stardew Valley,"Bought it first on PC. Now I have it on my PS4, Switch, phone."
Stardew Valley,Harvest moon or story of seasons? Where can i find information about this
Stardew Valley,1.5 for mobile but that's it
Stardew Valley,"I was referring to 1.5 update, which would be new for new players. Sorry if I mislead you.

https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/02/stardew_valleys_version_1_5_update_for_nintendo_switch_is_now_available"
Stardew Valley,"Im guessing Story of Seasons, doubt that Harvest Moon current owners would do this."
Stardew Valley,"[https://theamusetech.com/2021/12/04/stardew-valley-update-1-5-6-everything-we-know-so-far/](https://theamusetech.com/2021/12/04/stardew-valley-update-1-5-6-everything-we-know-so-far/)

Multiple other source, even Concerned Ape, speak of 1.5.6 coming."
Stardew Valley,I was saying that 1.5 still needs to be ported to mobile still because as far as I know that still needs to be done.
Spiritfarer,"Can't advise on Max Payne, but for the others...

Spiritfarer is, like you pointed out, an indie management sim game. I really enjoy it, but I like time/resource management stuff (Stardew Valley is one of my favorite games). Really though Spiritfarer is more about exploring stories about people's lives and accepting death; the management stuff is just to give you something to do to progress the stories of your passengers. It's sort of like a Ghibli film (the animation is definitely reminiscent of Ghibli's style), but of the more mature variety. There are some heavy emotional themes here; you get to know these characters, but ultimately you both know you'll send them off forever and never see them again. It's not quite a feeling I've gotten from other games before, and it's not really traumatic or depressing, but it is rather melancholic and wistful. It's a relaxing gameplay loop with heavy themes. 

Disco Elysium I haven't played, but I've watched LPs and videos on it enough that I think I can chime in. It's a very unique experience, and really pushes the ""role-playing"" aspect of RPGs further than most others. But it's a lot of point-and-click gameplay and a TON of reading. The dialogue is great, and the path you take can be extremely different depending on your choices and stats, which makes it very replayable. But it definitely isn't for everyone, or maybe even most people. This would be the biggest departure from your current gaming style. It may be a real gem that you love, or it could be way too different and something you regret. Biggest risk out of the list, IMO.

Dishonored is probably the safest choice (outside of maybe Max Payne - as said, don't know it). There are two very distinct ways of playing the game: as a first-person shooter where you use crazy powers and multiple weapons to slaughter your enemies; or as a stealth platformer where you avoid confrontation and solve your goals through non-lethal (though sometimes still decidedly horrific) indirect means. You can, of course, mix and match these styles; but the game environments and plot beats change depending on which side you lean into, and the middle of the road option isn't nearly as distinct or interesting, IMO. The plot is pretty good too, though the environment is what I really enjoyed. That being said, boy do the characters look ugly. There's a distinct art style, but everyone just looks pretty unpleasant, haha. Still, the game is solid even after being out for all these years, and I'd recommend it first out of these choices. Probably the most likely to entertain you - for the gameplay and combat, even if the story isn't your thing."
Spiritfarer,"pretty simple honestly, you love RDR2? You’ll love max payne 1,2, and 3 all worth it i can assure you."
Spiritfarer,"Disco is gonna be point and click all the way, a loooot of mandatory text reading, and some quests are hard to resolve. So i think about it well before bying it. But the game is good if u can enjoy it."
Gorogoa,RDR2 is an absolute triumph. It MUST be played.
Gorogoa,"I would generally recommend RDR2, which is one of the best games ever made.

Presentation is absolutely stunning across the board. Graphics, SFX, music, voice acting, all are absolutely stellar.

Gameplay-wise is also phenomenal. Essentially, to summarise, it plays as a 3rd-person shooter, with some RPG and simulation elements - it really shines in making you *feel* like the character you're playing as, that is, a cowboy in the late 19th/early 20th century, with all the gambling, outlawing, hunting, etc.

The content available is frankly some of the best value in any videogame. This is the most well-realised open-world game ever, in my estimation - an immersive world that feels natural and alive, that exists independently of you but reacts to your decisions. The story is fully fleshed out, dramatic, personal and intimate, but also self-aware enough to shine all the wild west tropes through. You have further an entire online mode that I haven't even touched yet.

When considering the preferences you laid out, I'm even more convinced you'll enjoy it. I'd recommend it over cyberpunk to anyone, but even more to someone with your preferences."
Gorogoa,"RDR2 is probably the better made game but I also loved Cyberpunk, it’s story, and it felt very creative and new. I liked someone else’s idea of doing RDR2 and buy Cyberpunk when DLC comes out so you can transition straight to DLC"
Gorogoa,"Love both, but I’d start with RDR2 buddy. And just know, it’ll be awhile before you start Cyberpunk once you get immersed into that work and Aruthur"
Gorogoa,U can miss cyberpunk. U cant pass on RDR2! Easy as that
Gorogoa,"Rdr2 without a doubt. The most beautiful open world, lots of chill out time, lots of random and very well written scripted quests, a sense of history with a bit of the absurd, and a tragic crime family story. It will give you a thrill, make you feel like a badass, and then leave you in tears."
Gorogoa,"I’m sure there will be a Complete Edition for Cyberpunk/Phantom Liberty, so wait on that. Cyberpunk was great; loved the story, Night City and the RPG elements. Granted I played on PS5 when that version was released. 

Red Dead Redemption II is one of the greatest games ever made. Five years later and it’s still worth full price. The quantity and quality of content is impressive."
Gorogoa,RDR2
Gorogoa,"As someone that was super hyped cyberpunk and hit it day 1, as faulty and buggy as it was at the time on my ps4, I enjoyed it, and now 100 times better with the next gen update and all on my ps5, that being said, RDR2 was one of the best games of the last generation, and it plays great on next gen consoles… definitely recommend RDR2, it’s not an rpg but getting lost in that world and along with the things you discover in it are very rpg like to me, definitely recommend RDR2"
Gorogoa,"RDR2.

Cyberpunk is cool, but it will be much cooler in a few months with the update/remake

I also would only get cyberpunk if you have at least a PS5/next gen/pc"
Gorogoa,Red dead redemption until cyberpunk dlc is released
Gorogoa,"No question, RDR2 all the way!"
Gorogoa,"I feel like RDR2 is a much better overall game, but is more divisive than you would be lead to believe. It's a slow burn story game, so if you're cool with that, it's way better.

Cyberpunk is exactly as you expect it to look and feel."
Gorogoa,"Cyberpunk base game is also been a lot of improvements when the DLC releases so get cyberpunk then with the DLC, for now its time for RDR2 Boah!!"
Gorogoa,RDR2
Gorogoa,RDR2 without a doubt
Gorogoa,"Red dead, even though I mostly play rpgs. Even though it’s fairly polished now I just find Cyberpunk to be boring. Idk I hope someday I can engage with it but it’s not now."
Gorogoa,"RDR2

Cyberpunk is also a very good game, and I do recommend you play it eventually

But with the DLC just around the corner (only three months away in fact) you should wait until it releases before getting it"
Gorogoa,"Wait for the DLC and play RDR2 while you wait. I personally liked Cyberpunk more, but RDR2 is amazing aswell."
Gorogoa,"Rdr2 and I liked both of them, but RDR2 is on another level"
Gorogoa,Rdr2
Gorogoa,"RDR2 is the most polished game I have ever played. The environments are highly-interactive and the world with it’s animals and people respond to you and each other in a very believable way. It’s story is an engaging epic action-drama grounded in reality. It’s extremely immersive.

CP2077 had very rough beginnings and, when I last played it late last year, that roughness still shows through on what otherwise feels like quite a nice game. Everyone knows about the bugs, so there’s no point mentioning them more here.  The physical environments and sound design are very well set up. But the NPCs populating the world will behave in ways that might break your immersion. When a gun is fired, they will all crouch in the same animation and despawn as soon as you aren’t looking. Police will spawn in on top of you when you commit a crime and don’t put up any chase when you flee. Feels disappointing in a world constructed around the notion of constant police-gang struggle. Supposedly this is slated to be reworked in the future.
The world has some interactivity more on par with games like dishonored 2. Dialogue feels particularly strong and the story is, in my experience, engaging. 
One strange thing is the character customisation. One premise of the world building is ‘fashion over function’. How you look is supposedly as important as how you act on the world of 2077. But this is totally at odds with the actual game mechanics. You will be heavily encouraged to wear clothes for their stats, not their appearance, and that will lead to some pretty weird costume combos. It doesn’t matter much because the game is entirely first person perspective, but that begs the (controversial?) question of why have a player model at all."
Gorogoa,Yes red dead redemption is much better on many levels right off the bat.
Gorogoa,Rdr2
Gorogoa,"Rdr2 100%. In my opinion it’s the best/most realistic video game ever made. The only downside is it’s ruined every game I’ve played after it. Either the graphics look terrible, the story is dumb, gaming mechanics aren’t as good etc.."
Gorogoa,"Hands down, RDR2. While I enjoyed Cyberpunk for what it is, I don't think that's a close call by almost any metric."
Gorogoa,"Red Dead Redemption 2 by far; I 100% Cyberpunk 2077, I did not 100% Red Dead.  Cyberpunk doesn't not have a lot of depth, unfortunately, its presentation is good and certainly has gotten better since launch but literally the only time I would even talk about it in the same breath as RDR2 is a question like yours, in terms of quality and depth and content, it doesn't hold a candle to RDR2.

There is of course a difference in setting to consider, but just keep in mind that while the 'cyberpunk' aesthetic is certainly present in Cyberpunk 2077, I'd argue it doesn't even do it as well as games like Shadowrun for SNES or Shadowrun for Genesis.  That may seem harsh, but again I did everything you could do in this game, it really doesn't have much going for it."
Gorogoa,RDR2
Gorogoa,"I would wait for the the dlc for Cyberpunk as it seems it will be some kind of mega side quest and will bring improvements to the base game as well, rdr2 is hit or miss I guess depending on people, it's a slow paced game but amazing visuals, story and immersion but with that said I finished cyberpunk and still will come back for the dlc, the game has a pretty big replayability if you like trying different approach to combat"
Gorogoa,"If you don't mind a slow burn for massive payoff then go for RDR2. You'll want to wait to play CP2077 until Phantom Liberty releases as they're doing an overhaul of the base game too.

Edit: Liberty not Pain"
Gorogoa,RDR2
Gorogoa,"No, it's not Next-Gen Optimized, but still RDR2 all day every day"
Gorogoa,"RDR2 is the superior game in my opinion. Cyberpunk is pretty bland in comparison. However, Cyberpunk has better performance in that, it can run at 60 fps on next- gen consoles (whereas RDR2 is locked at 30 fps) and is better optimized on PC, though still expect bugs. Also, RDR2 can be overwhelming with its size and detail, Cyberpunk is much smaller in scale."
Gorogoa,RDR 2 if you like a beautiful masterpiece
Gorogoa,"I just started RD2 on PC about a week ago and it’s absolutely sensational.

I do plan on getting CP after the new DLC comes out tho, and after I finish the main story in RD2!"
Gorogoa,You like computers or cowboys?
Gorogoa,"Seems like they’re going to add lots of fixes to the new gen consoles version of cyberpunk along with the expansion, so I think you should play RDR2 until a much better version of cyberpunk is out."
Gorogoa,RDR2.
Gorogoa,Red Dead Redemption 2
Gorogoa,"Wait for the Dlc of Cyberpunk, the game will get a massive overhaul with it"
Gorogoa,"RDR2 is the most polished game I have ever played. The environments are highly-interactive and the world with it’s animals and people respond to you and each other in a very believable way. It’s story is an engaging epic action-drama grounded in reality. It’s extremely immersive.

It doesn’t matter much because the game is entirely first person perspective, but that begs the (controversial?) question of why have a player model at all."
Gorogoa,"RDR2 is the most polished game I have ever played. The environments are highly-interactive and the world with it’s animals and people respond to you and each other in a very believable way. It’s story is an engaging epic action-drama grounded in reality. It’s extremely immersive.

CP2077 had very rough beginnings and, when I last played it late last year, that roughness still shows through on what otherwise feels like quite a nice game. Everyone knows about the bugs, so there’s no point mentioning them more here.  The physical environments and sound design are very well set up. But the NPCs populating the world will behave in ways that might break your immersion. When a gun is fired, they will all crouch in the same animation and despawn as soon as you aren’t looking. Police will spawn in on top of you when you commit a crime and don’t put up any chase when you flee. Feels disappointing in a world constructed around the notion of constant police-gang struggle. Supposedly this is slated to be reworked in the future.
The world has some interactivity more on par with games like dishonored 2. Dialogue feels particularly strong and the story is, in my experience, engaging. 
One strange thing is the character customisation. One premise of the world building is ‘fashion over function’. How you look is supposedly as important as how you act on the world of 2077. But this is totally at odds with the actual game mechanics. You will be heavily encouraged to wear clothes for their stats, not their appearance, and that will lead to some pretty weird costume combos. It doesn’t matter much because the game is entirely first person perspective, but that begs the (controversial?) question of why have a player model at all."
Gorogoa,Red Dead 2
Gorogoa,RDR2 duh. CP2077 world and setting is unlike anything I've seen before so that's why I liked it but the story and gameplay was just ok to me.
Gorogoa,"RD2 

Wait for cyberpunks expansion and then get it. It’s a good game on its own. Think Skyrim but in a cyberpunk setting. Yes is failed on some major systems they were supposed to have. Supposedly they are reworking a ton which will drop with the new expansion in September"
Gorogoa,Red Dead. Definitely Red Dead.
Gorogoa,RDR 2 hands down!
Gorogoa,rdr2 for sure!
Gorogoa,Rdr2
Gorogoa,"I might get some hate, but i enjoyed cyberpunk way more than i did rdr2. Maybe rdr2 was too tedious for me, or i didnt like the setting so much. Not sure, still a masterpiece though. 
Still id get cp2077"
Gorogoa,Red Dead Redemption 2
Gorogoa,RDR2. By a mile!
Gorogoa,"There has recently (as in, this weekend) been an article about the Cyberpunk DLC. Along side it is an overall of almost every system. The state its in now, Cyberpunk is *fine.* The open world feels so dead and empty, with nothing ever changing. You can stand and watch a NPC for 5 hours, and they will not move from there spot. The gunplay is fantastic, and the story is good, although that's of course subjective) I think part of that will be changing, along with the many other little tweaks they will be making, along side adding the DLC. So I would hold off. 

&#x200B;

RDR2, in contrast is amazing. The story, combat, graphics are wonderful and I don't have much bad to say about the game. My only complaint is the pacing of the story. It drags on a little to much, but at the same time, that's kind of the point? So It seems a weird complaint. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, TL;DR- Buy RDR2, Hold of on Cyberpunk until the DLC is released"
Gorogoa,Red dead 2. That game is forever in my heart
Gorogoa,"If you like RPG games, go for cyberpunk. But if you want an experience go for RDR2. Many people say that rdr2 doesn’t have a good story, but I believe that it is amazing. But I think everyone will agree that rdr2 has the best protagonist of all time, Arthur Morgan."
Gorogoa,[deleted]
Gorogoa,"It took me almost 70h to complete the main story in RDR2 that is without any side missions or free roaming.

Done the cyberpunk main story a lot of side quests and done some free roaming all under 50h"
Gorogoa,Both are great but I'd wait for Cyberpunk fixes and qol that come with the expansion so RDR2 first
Gorogoa,"RDR2 is probably the better made game but I also loved Cyberpunk, it’s story, and it felt very creative and new. I liked someone else’s idea of doing RDR2 and buy Cyberpunk when DLC comes out so you can transition straight to DLC"
Gorogoa,"I completed cyberpunk 3x with lowered graphics and shit fps. (Roll on phantom liberty with a 3080)

I didnt finish RDR2s first? Second? Act.

Dont get me wrong, I think RDR2 is an amazing game, probably the better one, but these are the facts lol."
Gorogoa,Rdr2.  Then In September you can get CP when it gets somewhat overhauled by developers
Gorogoa,Why is that even a question? RDR2 should be the default answer to this.
Gorogoa,Get both honestly. They are both masterpieces of games. I personally enjoy Cyberpunk a lot more but they are both fantastic in terms of story and gameplay.
Gorogoa,Cp 2077
Gorogoa,"I'd go with RDR2 first and, depending on how much free time you have, by the time you're done with it there'll probably be some version of Cyberpunk with Phantom Liberty included. Either way you'll have a great time with both, enjoy!"
Gorogoa,"I admit that rdr2 is the better made game,  I just got bored by it.  Cyberpunk was way more fun and engaging to me. I played on a pretty good pc, and didn't really have any expectations going into the game,  so I wasn't soured by anything.

Rockstar games kinda just bore me tbh. After playing the ps2 gta games to death,  any Rockstar game after just feels like it plays the exact same."
Gorogoa,I love Cyberpunk and never had bug issues. You should 100% get red dead as it’s probably the best game ever created.
Gorogoa,Red Dead Redemption 2 is already a complete game. Cyberpunk still needs polishing and should be even more solid after the expansion comes out in September. RDR2 will hold you until then.
Gorogoa,"if u have a series console, ps5, or high end pc, get cyberpunk for 30$ plus the expansion for another 30$. if u don't have that, then id say RDR2"
Gorogoa,"Have both and played both.  
RDR2 is super immersive and so finely tuned - but it is an open world Rockstar game so it's going to be a bit overwhelming, at least it was to me.  
Cyberpunk is also open world but a bit more linear.  It has that Skyrim like maneuverability where things can get wonky but it allows the player more freedom. 

I'd say go for cyberpunk and just play it now so you have an understanding of the game and story before the dlc comes out."
Gorogoa,"I have both.

Cyberpunk is more of RPG style than RDR2. There's skill points and such to distribute. RDR2 increases stats for you based on what you do.

Cyberpunk's AI have health bars, red dead's doesn't. It's more immersive for that reason.

RDR2 is much slower pace, but has a lot more to explore. The scenery can be breath-taking and sometimes hard to fathom how good it looks. 

Cyberpunk has a lot of nothing, but it still looks pretty cool. Nice graphics.

So far, I like cyberpunk's story but it can seem a bit all over the place.

RDR2 has been easier to follow."
Gorogoa,"If you just want a decent story with an immersive world and nice graphics, RDR2 is fine for that. It has pretty terrible gameplay, and it's a brain-dead easy game that treats players like they have 60 IQ. If you just want to turn off your brain for 60-hours and play through a decent story, then it fits the bill. Especially if you like the wild west and spaghetti western movies, then you will probably like RDR2. 

Cyberpunk has way better art direction than RDR2, but the game is severely lacking in terms of a lot of its open world systems. It has nowhere near as immersive of an open world as RDR2. The setting and visuals are a lot cooler, but the actual execution isn't there. The combat is not very good, but it's at least better than RDR2 in this area. It also has RPG systems and build variety which RDR2 doesn't have. Overall I'd say just wait until the DLC drops, because apparently they have reworked a lot of aspects of the game. CP2077 really does have a lot of potential, so if the DLC lives up to the hype, then it could be a game changer."
Gorogoa,I just tried cyberpunk a couple weeks ago off a freinds familyshare and its still super buggy to the point where i wound up getting fed up with the bugs and uninstalling. I would have felt very cheated if it was a game i payed for. So i would go with RDR2
Gorogoa,"Everyone says RDR2 is the best game ever, but the janky controls are super frustrating and honestly it’s pretty slow at times. I don’t need to watch long animations every time I pick something up or do anything. It’s more cowboy sim than game. 

Tried it 3 times and never make it past 10 hrs or so."
Gorogoa,[deleted]
Gorogoa,Both
Gorogoa,Mount a blade bannerlord has great rpg mechanics you can literally be anything in that world
Gorogoa,I would only choose Cyberpunk solely because it has next gen support. RDR2 is a fantastic game but lacks that kind of support which makes me personally not touch it ever since I beat it back in 2018.
Gorogoa,"RDR2. It’s a much more immersive game and story. Cyberpunk is a great game too, but I don’t find the story as good at all. The pros about cyberpunk are extreme weapon customization and playstyle customization with perk trees. When I play RDR2 I feel like I’m in the story, and when I play Cyberpunk I feel like I’m in a gigantic beautiful sandbox game."
Gorogoa,Cyberpunk
Gorogoa,"RDR2 is much more story rich and interactive compared to cyberpunk. It only takes around 30 hours to complete the main mission, spoiler alert ( when doing the last mission after doing so you get back to prior of starting the last mission to finish anything else to basically you don't fully finish it). It has nice features, ray tracing, and a nice environment, but RDR2 beats it in every other way. That's from my opinion as i have both and played both for 100 hours plus on each."
Gorogoa,"Cyberpunk has better writing and combat. Rdr2's world is more detailed, alive and polished. 
I prefer cyberpunk.
Most people seem to prefer rdr2."
Gorogoa,"RDR2. Ive played both and Cyberpunk really lacks in a lot of areas and i didn’t get much enjoyment from it after completing the main story line. RDR2 however is a game that ive replayed numerous times and spent upwards of 400 hours combined playing, most of it in free roam. Havent even touched the online yet."
Gorogoa,"Cyberpunk's DLC will remain as a DLC, it seems to be set in a new city, but at this point, nothing can be done about the game's dullness and how unfun it is to play. I played it for 25 hours(right until the 3-race side mission were unlocked), and it's just boring, the plot is mediocre, the fighting, the gameplay are subpar, the only redeeming thing was how beautiful everything looked, and that's it"
Gorogoa,I would be cautious with RDR2 on PC. I had to get a refund on it due to the game constantly crashing; the issues had to do specifically with the Rockstar games launcher which you are required to use.
Gorogoa,"Rdr2 is a bit of an ancient game in terms of design. Missions force you to do things one way and if you don’t listen the game fails you. It’s also an aggressively easy game that just feels stiff and clunky mechanics wise. It’s got great voice acting, but I found the world and story pretty dull. Cyberpunk is a far more enjoyable game that gives you choices on how to handle each mission with much better combat and a much more interesting world to explore and a far more interesting story."
Gorogoa,"This is a hard one, gotta do both haha"
Gorogoa,neither buy rain world 😈😈
Gorogoa,RDR2 no contest
Gorogoa,"Depends, if you're on console I would skip RDR2, it still runs at 30FPS, rockstar doesn't care about next gen update."
Gorogoa,"Neither, buy doom eternal"
Gorogoa,I dont like rdr2 at all and like project red games
Gorogoa,Cyberpunk. Red dead 2 is overrated imo
Gorogoa,They’re both great go with what interests you more.
Gorogoa,I've played both and I have some stronger critiques on RD2 than most but would still pick it over CP.
Gorogoa,"Both games are amazing, i loved Cyberpunk it's story characters, scenery. currently playing RDR2 its really good, both games are great. I'd buy both if i were u"
Gorogoa,Robots and guns or cowboys and guns
Gorogoa,"I’d go for Cyberpunk personally. The game is really good as long as you take your time and do the side quests. There are a ton of really compelling stories that get told. I’d wait to play until Phantom Liberty releases though. The gameplay is already good, but it’s rumored they’re going to be shipping big improvements to key systems like the AI and the police systems (and possibly more) with the DLC."
Gorogoa,I recommend getting both
Gorogoa,"Both are incredible story games, depends on what you want. If you care about story and characters, go red dead, if you care about combat and replay ability go cyberpunk"
Gorogoa,"Rdr2, 100000%"
Gorogoa,Cyberpunk if you want action. Red dead if you don't mind watching a movie in game format.
Gorogoa,Rdr2 cyberpunk has a lot of problems
Gorogoa,RDR2
Gorogoa,Red dead partner!
Gorogoa,Red Dead is the better game hands down.
Gorogoa,RDR2
Gorogoa,Do you want to be a cowboy? If so…follow your heart
Gorogoa,Cyberpunk has a big DLC coming soon.
Gorogoa,"With the Phantom Liberty expansion, which overhaul all of cyberpunk. It will great to buy...


But RDR2 is a moderm masterpiece so it gets my vote"
Gorogoa,"Cyberpunk is more action and adrenaline, Red Dead Redemption 2 is more laid back and slow-paced.  


Cyberpunk has been getting updates continually since release and is awesomely upgraded by this point...I never finished RDR2, but I finished Cyberpunk and am waiting at the edge of my seat for Phantom Liberty, which is going to be a *huge* DLC and should be later this year.  


Cyberpunk.  My two cents."
Gorogoa,"RDR2, it's much more detailed and alive rather than cyberprank, tho I enjoyed cyberprank (played from friend's console) its just not within the same level of RDR2 also the balancing of story telling and action on RDR2 is peak unlike in cyberpunk you're always just sitting and listening"
Gorogoa,I don’t usually post on reddit but i just want to make sure that you get RDR2
Gorogoa,"Both are great, but I think Cyberpunk is the more engaging game. Red Dead suffers from the antiquated Rockstar game design. Almost no freedom during missions, you’re just railroaded through each section and must play it as the developers intend."
Gorogoa,Red dead 2 is my pick. Cyberpunk was fun but i can’t just sit back and enjoy the world like i can with RDr2
Gorogoa,"In my opinion, Red Dead Redemption 2 was an incredible experience, especially in the beginning and middle game. However, I found myself getting bored after reaching around 60% completion, as there weren't many new things to explore once I had acquired the best weapon. 

On the other hand, Cyberpunk had superior writing and enjoyable gameplay, but it did suffer from some noticeable bugs."
Gorogoa,"RDR2 and anyone who says diff is crazy ive completed both games and theres just nothing that compares to RDR2 everything about it is so amazing but for me my fav thing about the game was the story telling. the best storytelling ive ever experienced in a game hands down. it could of been a oscar winning film. i literally cryed during a few scenarios in the game,"
Gorogoa,Lol EASY choice. RDR2.
Gorogoa,Are you on pc ? If you don’t wanna keep the games forever. I can tell you how to get them for like 2$ both on steam
Gorogoa,"I vote rdr, as well. BUT, if you haven't played Witcher 3, that's another great one. Plus, it often heavily discounted."
Gorogoa,RDR2 and its not even close
Gorogoa,"Red dead 2. There isn’t a game that has immersed me more than this game, I play butt nekkid and pretend I’m a O’Driscol. 10 Cowboys out of 10"
Gorogoa,"I’ve played both and loved both, but I fully believe that RDR2 is truly the best game ever, go with that first!"
Gorogoa,"Rdr2 is very pretty and has some interesting things in it but from a gameplay perspective it's unbelievably barren. You don't even get to aim your gun in this game really and all the missions are basically ""walk here, listen to dialogue, kill guys"".

Cyberpunk at least has some depth to combat. It's a passable first person shooter. Not a great one mind you, but it works. The missions here are also just ""walk here, listen to dialogue, kill guys"".

Personally the dialogue in both these games puts me to sleep and that's like 70% of both. But I guess I would say the Rdr2 dialogue at least feels finished, whereas the cyberpunk dialogue very frequently feels like a placeholder."
Gorogoa,RDR 2 is a no brainer in this case
Gorogoa,"Cyberpunk over RDR2. While RDR2 is a great game, i found it slow, and alot of the “immersive” mechanics being pretty surface level and just boring. Unpopular take, but Cyberpunk is more fun."
Gorogoa,I’d wait till the new expansion for CP2077 comes out. It’s supposed to bring a whole bunch of QOL changes to the base game.
Gorogoa,RDR2
Gorogoa,No
Gorogoa,"RDR2 was fun, but I was more hyped for Cyberpunk 2077. Ended up not caring for RDR2 so much after burning myself out on it, but Cyberpunk absolutely failed me in almost every department. RDR2 is the way to go."
Gorogoa,"Wait for the cyberpunk dlc to drop before you buy since they are redoing A LOT of the mechanics. I believe it’s September 26 so you have a lot of time to finish red dead. Plus the summer sale is soonish I think so you might be able to get the game and dlc for cheap depending on what price they set. 

I’ve played both and even though it’s been a while since I played cyberpunk and I just finished red dead 3 days ago both are excellent games in their own right but I’d probably play red dead before cyberpunk."
Gorogoa,**\*\*\* me scrolling through the comments to find the crazy psychopath that chooses cyberpunk over rdr2 \*\*\***
Gorogoa,Cyberpunk is fun but it doesn’t come close to RDR2.
Gorogoa,"It depends on what type of games you like, red dead is more story based and polished, but cyberpunk is more ""fuck around and break the game"", but in a good way

Cyberpunk has leveling and a skill tree, and rdr doesn't, so I think you'd like it more

Also red dead was built with miracles or something because it runs like a dream"
Gorogoa,[removed]
Gorogoa,Both games are really good but RDR2 is my favourite game all time so pick RDR2
Gorogoa,"Both are great, but RDR2 is looong but with lots of content"
Gorogoa,Rdr2
Gorogoa,Cyberpunk is more fun. RDR2 gets crazy tedious
Gorogoa,"Red Dead 2 is worth its weight in gold. The story is perfectly told, with some of the best voice acting I've ever heard in a video game. The world is vast, and you never feel like you're completely out of things to do. Bored of missions? Hunt some animals for upgrades to both your player or your camp. Tired of hunting? Put your criminal mind to robbing a store or train. Want to help the law? Check the local sheriff's office for a bounty. The list of activities goes on and on...


So to answer your question, take a break from the cybernetics and neon signs of Night City and go on a breathtaking journey through late 1800's America with Dutch Van der Linde and the gang!"
Gorogoa,"Go with red dead and play cyberpunk after the last dlc comes out. There will probably some sale for a definitive edition down the line.

Both games are definitely worth to be played."
Gorogoa,Do you prefer cowboys or cyborgs
Gorogoa,Finished Rdr2 3 times already and would pay 200$to forget everything and start the game again without remembering anything. Cyberpunk I enjoyed the story but the game was full of bugs and lost the interest of playing it again even if it is fixed or not
Gorogoa,"I played red dead 2 after it had been out for like 4 years not expecting much. I didn't even buy it, I played my brothers copy, that's the only reason I tried it. It turned out to be my favorite game ever. I'm not particularly interested in the wild west. It felt like watching a movie in the best way possible. It's the only game I can think of where I was sad because I knew it was ending soon. I can't recommend it enough.

I was excited for cyberpunk for years. I was incredibly disappointed when I finally was able to play it, I put about 20 hours in it and feel no urge to continue playing it. Even after they've patched it."
Gorogoa,"All you need to do is listen to the song ""Video games"" by Tenacious D. You're welcome."
Gorogoa,RDR2. Cyberpunk's getting totally reworked head to toe alongside new DLC in September and *that's* when you should buy it.
Gorogoa,RDR2
Gorogoa,rdr2
Gorogoa,RDR2!
Gorogoa,Hmph. Rdr2 is a masterpiece. Cyberpunk quite literally is bad. Phantom liberty sounds very promising on paper but we’ll have to see. So did this game pre release and I’d give it a 5/10.
Gorogoa,Is this post by OP a joke?
Gorogoa,RDR2
Gorogoa,"Rdr2 has a much stronger plot and cast. And the world is gorgeous.

Cyberpunk is also fantastic and a lot of fun, BUT it’s a lot more you having to role play the character"
Gorogoa,"Loved both, but like everyone has already said, start with RDR2. CP2077 is a fantastic game, but it will get better once the Phantom Liberty update comes out."
Gorogoa,Rdr2 all day. By far my fav game all time.. online sux d tho.
Gorogoa,I couldn't get into RDR2 personally. I was enjoying the story and it's the most beautiful game ever made but I thought the gameplay and controls were so rudimentary I stopped at Chapter 3. Meanwhile I really liked Cyberpunk especially the story and although its gameplay isn't groundbreaking it didn't stop me from finishing the game.
Gorogoa,"Red dead, no doubt."
Gorogoa,RDR2 is one of the best games humanity has ever witnessed
Gorogoa,"Most people are saying RD2, but my vote is for Cyberpunk. Bugs aren't as bad now, and the story is great. Along with a bunch of different builds. You can be a ninja with a katana, a run and gun madman, or a tech savvy hacker. The atmosphere is great and helps tie everything together, and the characters you meet really make it amazing. Just like all of CDPR's games, they really go all out with side quests and side story characters. Plus, Phantom Liberty releases in September, so if it's on sale, I would go for it. Cyberpunk is by far one of my favorites, and honestly, RD2 doesn't even get close to my top games.
That being said, both Cyberpunk and RD2 are both amazing games. I just lean more towards Cyberpunk."
Gorogoa,"I say pick up Cyberpunk, it might be worthwhile to play the game now, with the original story, before playing Phantom Liberty. As Phantom Liberty is very likely going to come with some new endings, and possibly some other changes outside the ones we already know.

Plus I just think its a good game, well worth the money nowadays after 1.5. Mods make it even more fun to play around with. Just an entertaining experience.

On top of that Cyberpunk is truly an RPG, it lets you choose your skills, pick different perks, use different weapons. You truly build your character the way you want. Its very similar to thinks likeSkyrim in that way. Where as Red Dead 2 is just the same character no matter what, there is no leveling system or anything. Its really more of an action adventure title than a true RPG. 

So if you want to get immersed into an RPG and its setting, in similar fashion to things like Skyrim, I recommend 2077."
Gorogoa,RDR2 with no hesitation and do not read spoilers.
Gorogoa,"Hey unpopular opinion time. I played both.

RDR2 is certainly a marvel. The story is amazing, graphics are second to none, the protagonist is probably the most well flushed out I've ever experienced in a game, and overall the game really is a must play.

....but it's a bit of a drag yeah? It's very slow paced, and I found myself just wanting to play other games from time to time. This isn't really a negative point, and is definitely subjective, but man it can DRAG. 



Cyberpunk (post patches) is a wild ride. The story is a blast, and really kicks. The set pieces are way above what I expected in an open world game. The side quests, as expected from CDPR are just as good, if not better than the main story in many cases. Definitely a case of art direction trumping graphical fidelity. While it doesn't look bad by any stretch... Walking though Chinatown in the middle of the night is a sight to behold. Vibrant neon lighting, crowded streets, some guy getting mugged in an alley, the constant cacophony of people shouting and talking... I haven't felt that level of immersion in a game... Maybe ever.

Yeah it's a bit of a mess. But way better than the sum of its parts. Unfortunately I listened to the online griping, and missed out for longer than necessary, but take from someone who was hesitant, it blew me away.

At the end of the day Cyberpunk is just ***fun***. The shooting is chunky and effective, the driving is arcady but feels good, the plot and characters are fucking bonkers, and there really are just so many ways to play the game.

I played it the first time as a learning curve. A little hacking, a little shotgun, a little melee. It was pure chaos and really felt like I was a newbie in night city trying to climb to the top.

Second time thru and I'm playing full stealth. Feels like a totally different game. I walk in an alley, activate my speed implant, turn invisible, and walk through putting a bullet in everyone's head. Come out the other side, and watch the bodies drop before the cameras ever had a chance to catch me. Suddenly I felt like an elite level assassin that was born and bred in this world.


You can't go wrong either way, but I tip towards CP"
Gorogoa,"cyberpunk, rdr2 is a linear game in an open world setting with the most boring chapter 1 in existence, also everything you do (pointless animation) is so slow and infuriating that you can fall asleep"
Gorogoa,I think rdr2 has more replayability if that matter to you as far as stretching your dollar. I dont find myself excitingly opening cyberpunk. I felt like 1 playthrough was enough to get a big grasp of the game.
Gorogoa,"Rdr2 is a masterpiece. It’s slow paced but if you adapt your speed to it, rather than trying to force it to your speed, it’s fantastic! It is the most alive environment of any game I’ve played. Can interact with just about everything too. And npc’s actually seem like they are more than objects moving around the screen."
Gorogoa,RDR2 is one of the greatest games ever made.
Gorogoa,"I have both. The answer is both. Just get both, play them both for less than two-hours each, and refund the one you don’t want."
Gorogoa,"Unquestionably RDR2 is the better, more fully realized game. 

I think the best question to answer from a prospective standpoint, however, is what is your preferred gaming experience? Do you like 'slow' as a concept? Do you enjoy being diverted from whatever you initially planned doing? If a game world is both fun and immersive, are you happy with killing an hour or two wandering around it and not focusing on story progression? If yes to all of the above, You will love RDR2. If you are very task oriented and want everything to be a quick hit, then RDR2 isn't going to be your cup of tea regardless of its (excellent) level of quality.

That's generally what people mean when they say this game is divisive. The less patient get frustrated with its deliberateness."
Gorogoa,Wait until the Cyberpunk expansion comes out at a discount. It will probably be in its best state at that point.
Gorogoa,"Red Dead 2 all the way. It took me like 3 attempts of replaying the beginning before I finally got hooked on the game and I wish it didn’t cause I’ve been missing out! 

It’s such a beautiful game. The guns are dope, (just experiment, you can’t lose unless you don’t like the gun which you can just store away) and the world is vast but alive

Like you’ll suddenly get ambushed or some fools will try to rob you; or woodcutters are felling trees, or a criminal is complaining on the back of a horse tied up"
Gorogoa,I played both RDR2 on s a great experience but a little slower pace. Cyberpunk was broke and I fell off before I completed it
Gorogoa,"Both are on sale pretty often but I would do RDR2 first without question. There are certain games you absolutely have to at least play. Don’t have to finish it if it don’t click but it’s an absolute must play. Cyberpunk is a great story with not the best gameplay, plus very raunchy. It’s gotten much better over the years however."
Gorogoa,Red dead 2 is leagues better imo
Gorogoa,Rdr2 is probably the best story in a game I have ever played. Full stop. It is genuinely one of the most amazing game stories there is. I would recommend it over cyberpunk based on that alone
Gorogoa,Red Dead 1st by far
Gorogoa,"Imo they are both very enjoyable from a story and gameplay angle. Some of it comes to taste (do you want a Wild West game or futuristic urban environment?). In my opinion you can’t go wrong but there is a reason Red Dead 2 is considered one of the greatest single player games of all time. 


Also, if this matters, cyberpunk is a 30-50 hour game if you complete the story and do a lot of side quests. Red dead 2 is more of a 50+ hour kind of game."
Gorogoa,RDR2
Gorogoa,I would say red dead now and cyberpunk later
Gorogoa,"Cause I don't play video games no more
Never play video games
But Red Dead Redemption 2, that is not a game
It's an incredible journey through old American history
Fighting for your life and fighting for your family
Try to live your days with honor and integrity
That's not a game, that's an adult thing
That's not a game at all
That's like fuckin' Shakespeare
- Jack Black"
Gorogoa,"Objectively RDR2 is the better game in almost every way, and it’s also cheaper right now. But man I can’t help but absolutely adore cyberpunk, even more than red dead. My brain says get red dead but my heart says get cyberpunk"
Gorogoa,"Cyberpunk is pretty cool, but RDR2 is a goddamn masterpiece."
Gorogoa,"If you like first person action RPG and sci -fi allot like I do Cyberpunk carried the magic. After the millionth plot twist I gave up on Rdr2, cyberpunk is short sweet and tragic."
Gorogoa,I would say get red dead. It honestly looks like the better game out of the two and you can always get a refund if you really don't like it.
Gorogoa,"Red dead 2, 100%"
Gorogoa,Could not put RDR2 down finished in under a month. Cyberpunk took me at least 4.
Gorogoa,99.9% of time my answer to this sub is just r/piratedgames
Gorogoa,rdr2 all the way
Gorogoa,Red Dead Redemption 2 !
Gorogoa,Rdr 2
Gorogoa,Both are amazing and should be played but get rdr2 first and wait till the new dlc to get cyberpunk.
Gorogoa,"RDR2 is to date the best single game I’ve ever played by far.

It’s a masterpiece."
Gorogoa,RDR2. Without a doubt.
Gorogoa,RDR2
Gorogoa,Do you want rootin tootin cowboy shootin or stressy messy cyborg depressy?
Gorogoa,"I love both, but cyberpunk is good and RDR2 is next level amazing."
Gorogoa,"In between missions, RDR2 is quite therapeutic to play."
Gorogoa,"Late to the party, but would like to share my thoughts:

CP2077 has some fantastic writing and beautiful graphics. That being said, it’s a very shallow game in every other department. Given the world-building, it has amazing potential. If they had just given the game another couple years to incubate, it easily could’ve been one of the greatest action-adventure RPGs of its time. 

RDR2 is, on the other hand, *also* a game that has fantastic writing and beautiful graphics. It is, however, the type of game that *did* get the time it needed to fully flesh out all the other aspects of its gameplay. The result is a highly immersive experience with a lot of replayability and content that can last you hundreds of hours."
Gorogoa,"It's not even really a fair comparison. 

RDR2 is a ridiculous rich and developed world with unbelievable detail (sometimes to much) and a story that is extremely engaging. It also has some of the best NPC reactions/interactions and is probably one of the top 3 hunting games in the last decade all rolled into one.

Cyberpunk is a mostly dead world with poor interactivity with npcs, a convoluted story that barely makes sense, and is almost entirely empty. I know I mentioned dead and empty twice but it needed repeating. The game had so much potential it didn't live up to its ridiculous. The games AI is almost as bad as basic vanilla skyrim back in the day. Luckily most of the bugs seem to have been dealt with but the game is still not worth buying in my opinion"
Gorogoa,I've played both. They're both pretty good. Rdr2 is the best of the 2.
Gorogoa,def red dead!
Gorogoa,I have never met someone who didnt like rdr2 but cyberpunk seems to be hit or miss i have friends who love it but i have had no enjoyment playing it at all
Gorogoa,"Cyberpunk is one of my all-time favourites, but Red Dead II is objectively the GOAT"
Gorogoa,RDR 2 and don't think twice. Cyberpunk is good but RDR2 is a masterpiece and goated.
Gorogoa,"I haven't played Cyberpunk yet, but RDR2 is a must play. I held off on playing RDR2 for a long time, due to people saying its slow paced. That was a mistake. I didn't feel slow to me, because the story is so good. If it was a movie, it would get an Oscar."
Gorogoa,Rdr2 first and then cyberpunk
Gorogoa,RDR2 no contest
Gorogoa,RDR2 is at minimum a top 10 all time must play game
Gorogoa,Red dead is wayyyy better than cyber.
Gorogoa,"10/10 ""wild west"" (kind of) open world with a 10/10 story or a, well, cyberpunk open world with a 9,5/10 story


your call"
Gorogoa,"Rdr2 is amazing. Cyberpunk is great and one of the better open world games I've played ever. I've played a lot of games and I adore this game. Wasn't perfect obviously with the console bugs but it's still great. If you're on pc then get it,next gen consoles then yeah. Previous gen then definitely no. 

After playing both, I can say both are great and damn good games. RDR2 is a masterpiece and Cyberpunk could one day end up being remembered as one. If not for the bugs and launch issues then kt would've been perfect imo"

Gorogoa,"Cyberpunk is one of the more fun games I've played in years.  Red dead redemption 2 is the single greatest game I've ever played. Play both, but start with red dead."
Gorogoa,How much is rdr2? I just bought it for $70? 😭😭😭😭
Gorogoa,Anyone who is a gamer must play RDR2
Gorogoa,Cyberpunk. That's just me though. This is really a question you need to ask yourself.
Gorogoa,"Well I would say both, but I would suggest leaving cyberpunk aside until Phantom Liberty comes out and you can experience it at its highest. So for now, I recommend Red Dead. It's very fun, finished it recently, couldn't put my controller down, one week of my holiday gone, spent 110 hours on the game. Just don't overwhelm yourself and don't rush too much with the story, just enjoy the game's atmosphere and its randomness and progress in the story in whatever way feels best to you.

If you worry about completionism, I recommend making a manual save for everytime you start a new chapter."
Gorogoa,Cyberpunk has finally gotten out of the shadow of its launch and is finally the game it was promised to be. But RDR 2 would be Rockstar’s masterpiece if the first game and GTA V didn’t already exist. Definitely check both games out but give Red Dead Redemption 2 a try first.
Gorogoa,I liked Cyberpunk a lot but RDR2 is the way to go
Gorogoa,Cyberpunk only because it going to get a overhaul that makes the game worth playing but red dead 2 is hella fun as well so wouldn't blame you if you got that over it since cyberpunk started off bad and kept people off it.
Gorogoa,RDR2. It has an amazing story.
Gorogoa,I haven't played Cyberpunk but RDR2 is such a masterpiece so that's my vote :)
Gorogoa,Red Dead Redemption is a masterpiece. Cyberpunk in its current state is fine but nowhere near RDR2 level.
Gorogoa,RDR2
Gorogoa,"I played both, and 110% would pick RDR2 over cyberpunk. I think I’ve replayed it 4 times now. Played through Cyberpunk once and haven’t felt much like going back. Just a richer story in RDR2."
Gorogoa,"i know everyone and their mom has already said it in this comment section, but i’m gonna add my voice to the choir anyways: rdr2 first, without a doubt."
Gorogoa,RDR2 is great. would never spend money on cyberjunk
Gorogoa,Rdr2 is slow as fuck cyberpunk is fast paced so i would go for cyberpunk (haven't been a fan of slow paced walking and riding Sims no matter how good the story is if they can't give it to me in a faster manner or keep me retained i ain't bout that)
Gorogoa,RDR 2
Gorogoa,"Wow, someone needs to rep cyberpunk here.  I loved it.  Best game of last 5 years for me.

Rdr2 was boring for me.  Scenery was pretty and all but I just found it repetitive.  Ride horse, shoot, do boring camp stuff, etc.  I dunno I like doing that stuff in real life.  

Cyberpunk is just super fun.  The soundtrack bangs.. you get swords implanted in your arms... the lore is super interesting.. lots of meaningful choices.  It's the only game I've ever replayed 

CP got a bad rap at launch.  I get it.  But on PS5 today it rocks"
Gorogoa,"Cyberpunk will have a GOTY edition either with Phantom Liberty’s release or shortly thereafter. Acquiring RDR2 right now makes more sense, at least to me."
Gorogoa,Buy rdr2 and when cyberpunk gets a complete edition buy that one later on
Gorogoa,Both are incredible. I would not recommend getting Cyberpunk on a PS4 as it just stops working for me after like an hour of play time. RDR2 is a considerably better game but both are worth it
Gorogoa,"Play RDR, then go to the second one - you won't regret it."
Gorogoa,"I'm playing Cyberpunk rn and while id say it is a very good game and looks incredible, it is still nowhere near as polished as RDR2, combat, movement, interactions, npcs, customization and most of the things that make an open world/exploration game good are better in RDR2 in my opinion. But id still recommend you to get Cyberpunk later, it is a great game."
Gorogoa,"Red dead 2, Cyberpunk isn't bad now, but RDR2 still has a good case for being the best game of all time."
Gorogoa,I would get RDR2 first. Its long game with a much better story imo. Plus cyberpunk is getting that expansion in a few months that'll be overhauling some gameplay mechanics.
Gorogoa,Cyberpunk.
Gorogoa,"Red dead’s storymode is god tier, online can be amazing, Cyberpunk is very good, Perosnally I’d say red dead if you’ll play the online, cyberpunk if ur not gonna play the online"
Gorogoa,"I say it depends on your system. I have a PS4 slim and cyberpunk is unplayable after the last large update. Gonna have to get a ps5 to actually play it. Could be my save corrupted somehow, but the game freezes after 20 minutes almost religiously."
Gorogoa,RDR2 is one the best video games ever made. Definitely go for that first.
Gorogoa,RDR2 any day of the week.
Gorogoa,"Play RDR2 first and then buy Cyberpunk when the new expansion drops. I love both games, but it sounds like CP2077: Phantom Liberty will be the definitive edition"
Gorogoa,"I would recommend both, but you need to play RDR2 if you haven't first"
Gorogoa,Red dead redemption 2 a million times over cyberpunk
Gorogoa,"RDR2, absolutely."
Gorogoa,"I think cyberpunk and the expansion are on sale right now. But I’d go for rdr2 first considering it will be more instant gratification then having to wait till December for the expansion on cyberpunk, which will have a ton of new content meant to make the experience way better."
Gorogoa,"Cyberpunk is poorly written, rdr2 is a masterclass"
Gorogoa,RDR2 by a mile
Gorogoa,"I played both games this year. I haven't finished Cyberpunk yet but it's pretty fun, I love everything about it except for some game breaking bugs and funny braindead AI. Both games are great but RDR2 is a triump; storytelling, characters, sound design, voice acting and impressive life-like world with a lot of details and hidden gems in it although gameplay is your standard Rockstar game, it's still an immersive game."
Gorogoa,"I would recommend that you never buy cyberpunk and if Red dead is your thing, go for it. (It’s not my thing. But seriously, don’t buy cyberpunk.)"
Gorogoa,Definitely Red Dead Redemption 2. Best game i have ever played since 2006
Gorogoa,"huge cyberpunk fan here, i'd probably buy it when phantom liberty comes out since they're overhauling everything. RDR2 however was a masterpiece when it came out. definitely grab it, especially if on sale"
Gorogoa,RDR2 will make you question if any game you ever played was good at all.
Gorogoa,"Fair warning. I also say RDR2, BUT you need to go into it realizing it IS intentionally slower paced. Take your time with it, really invest in the characters and just hang out in the world, exploring and such. However, that said, I absolutely LOVE RDR2. It’s my favorite of all time."
Gorogoa,Rdr2
Gorogoa,"Both are really good 

I really enjoyed RDR2 a lot but Cyberpunk has something that really made me love it. 

I don't know if it's the setting or the overall dystopian world but it's a really great experience now

Plus Phantom Liberty is coming in september I believe so it might be worth a try"
Gorogoa,"Both are on par and considered masterpieces of their own, CP story is more complex and fast paced while RDR2 is more of a slow burn kind of story. I think that CP is the superior game but I think you should buy both."
Gorogoa,"Imo RDR2 is superior in essentially every aspect, I would definitely try it out."
Gorogoa,Get both
Gorogoa,"Definitely RDR2, seriously it contains the best protagonist you’ll ever play."
Gorogoa,"Red dead is a must - cyberpunk is a should, so play RDR 2 first, then when the DLC is out pick up cyberpunk"
Gorogoa,RDR2. I played both but for me RDR2 is just better.
Gorogoa,"RDR2 barring it’s online is easily one of the best games ever made in my opinion. Same goes for RDR1, which can be played in either order. On top of that there’s undead nightmare as an added plus"
Gorogoa,"I love both. But if I had to choose, it would be RDR2"
Gorogoa,"Honestly both are really great games, you should pick based on what type of world you would like to dive into. Dystopian future, vs movie western."
Gorogoa,Rdr2 killed my parents. We’re happily married now.
Gorogoa,"RDR2 for sure!!!! I'm playing it again right now. Easily in my top 10 greatest games of all time. And with the amount of games I've played over 30+ years, that is really saying something."
Gorogoa,Honestly they are both amazing In their own rights. RDR2 is considered one of the best games of all time tho so it’s an easy pick
Gorogoa,"Obvious answer is rdr 2 first, but let me say this. No open world game will ever be the same after rdr2. Its miles ahead any game ive played to this day, technically and story wise."
Gorogoa,"Both games are amazing. You can't go wrong with either - great storyline, great side quests, you can just dig yourself in for hours and hours. I'd highly recommend both. But if I had to pick one, I'd say RDR2. It left a bigger impression on me after finishing it."
Gorogoa,"RDR2 is probably the better game from a technical standpoint, but I found the controls kind of kludgy to be honest.  I beat it once and have never felt the desire to replay it.

Cyberpunk on the other hand is the kind of game I can beat then immediately want to start a new character.  Yeah, it's undoubtably not as polished, but I just had more fun with it.  (Again, a big part of this probably just comes back to the controls, which were a lot smoother in Cyberpunk.)

Honestly...  You should just  get them BOTH!"
Gorogoa,Rdr2 is easily the greatest console game ever made
Gorogoa,"They’re very different games which is something to bare in mind. However, RDR2 is a much more polished product. I’d play that first and then pick up 2077/Phantom Liberty because they have basically said that the entire game is getting overhauled and polished with the next update/DLC in September. Both games will grip you emotionally as they’re very well written"
Gorogoa,I played through cyberpunk twice. I stopped playing RDR2 when I got bored of riding my horsey.
Gorogoa,Cyberpunk. Honestly RDR2 kind of bored me
Gorogoa,And I will play it. Thanks for the reply.
Gorogoa,Yeah what else is there to say? Although Cyberpunk is very enjoyable
Gorogoa,I would say portal is a triumph.
Gorogoa,"Sure, I guess then RDR2 it is. Thanks for the reply."
Gorogoa,I won't pass on either but I guess first I will go through RDR2. Thanks for the reply.
Gorogoa,I didn't feel the same. What is so unmissable about red dead for you?
Gorogoa,To be honest it really depends. Personally I felt Red dead was a little to realistic for me and Cyber punk was more actiony.
Gorogoa,">It will give you a thrill, make you feel like a badass, and then leave you in tears.

beautifully said."
Gorogoa,Yes.
Gorogoa,Same here it's hard to get into other games since I've played rdr2 I keep going back to it.
Gorogoa,"Yeah, I guess waiting for the new update and dlc is the best option as new things will be added along with overhauls. Thanks for the reply."
Gorogoa,What kind of depth does rdr2 have?
Gorogoa,"Yeah. I just saw the dlc as pre-order along with Cyberpunk, but I think it will not be a great idea to buy it as they are adding and overhauling some features of the game in the next update probably. I guess waiting atleast till the update will be the right choice. Thanks for the reply."
Gorogoa,I’ve just started the game is it best to wait for the DLC then and when does it drop ?
Gorogoa,Phantom Pain is Metal Gear Solid. Cyberpunk 2077's expansion is called Phantom Liberty.
Gorogoa,Do you know if ultimate version of RDR2 is worth it?
Gorogoa,Any other game similar to rdr2 in gameplay? I love the sort of chill vibes with the option of action.
Gorogoa,Careful it's CP2077
Gorogoa,"Just a minor note that the outfit issue was fixed with a transmog function, so now you can play dress up and not just worry about stats.  But if you want to see your own outfit you have to drive a motorcycle."
Gorogoa,Should I finish cyberpunk before the dlc?
Gorogoa,"Yeah same here, RDR2 was amazing but I was way more immersed in Cyberpunk's world than RDR2's one 

Though both are really great games and should be played imo"
Gorogoa,"Sorry to bother, but I would also like to ask which edition of RDR2 should I get. I will tell beforehand that I don't think I will be playing online version of the game."
Gorogoa,I think most people agree that RDR2’s story is great and the strongest part of the game besides the visuals.
Gorogoa,"Bruh. Who has the audacity to say RDR2 doesn’t have a good story?

It’s been widely, widely lauded as having one of the best stories in recent years"
Gorogoa,"Thanks. I think story is subjective so might really like RDR2 too as I am not a huge fan of futuristic world. Though I am not a huge fan of Cowboys either (mediaeval fan here), though I might like it if I play it. Thanks for replying, I might get RDR2 now and wait for the update and expansion of Cyberpunk."
Gorogoa,"I don't know about the story, but the best video game character is BT-7274. Period."
Gorogoa,"This is how I feel. Cyberpunk was faster paced and I got more immediate gratification. I actually still haven’t gotten very far in RDR2 just because it has been slower-paced, but that being said, it is an exceptionally well-designed game"
Gorogoa,"You’ve just described my exact experience. I really enjoyed RDR2 but we had just had our first baby when the it released - I just didn’t have the time and it fell by the wayside as a result, so I never finished it. Cyberpunk I managed to complete several times over on PS4 Pro and one more on PS5. Every single play through I’ve played completely differently to the last. It’s been immense. The sheer variety on offer with the story and the play styles means totally different experiences each time. While Red Dead is a beautiful and epic experience - it’s a fairly unilateral one. The only real variety coming from how many side missions or how much peripheral content you want to pursue. My wife played Cyberpunk more than I did - her sessions were vastly different to mine. I haven’t seen anything quite like it since the likes of Elder Scrolls."
Gorogoa,“HANK! DON’T ABBREVIATE CYBERPUNK LIKE THAT! HAAAAANK!”
Gorogoa,Not really. Where is the single player content?
Gorogoa,"Same is experience. RDR2 more polished and you interact with more things, and NPC has better reactions. But cyberpunk is just more fun to play.

My biggest issue with rockstar games is that on rails and very linear. That’s being said they still quality games and will buying the next Rockstar game when it comes out."
Gorogoa,You can always turn off aim assist for a better challenge in RDR2
Gorogoa,What do you mean by terrible gameplay in RDR2?
Gorogoa,"Yeah, just saw the amount of things they are adding in the update and expansion. Some of it is overhaul of current systems so I guess waiting for the update and the dlc is the best thing for now. Anyways, I would like to ask one more thing, should I buy RDR2 on Epic store or Steam because as far as I have heard, Epic store has a really bad mod support for games. And I guess there some fine mods for RDR2 so would like to get my hands on them. Thanks."
Gorogoa,"> game i *paid* for. So

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*"
Gorogoa,"I played the game about a year ago and only experienced like 5 bugs, none of them even being close to game breaking"
Gorogoa,I bought and played a month or so ago and experienced almost 0 bugs. I think one quest messed up and that was it. After the most recent patch it seems pretty good. Also looks amazing with the ray tracing.
Gorogoa,">the janky controls are super frustrating and honestly it’s pretty slow at times. I don’t need to watch long animations every time I pick something up or do anything. It’s more cowboy sim than game.  
>  
>Tried it 3 times and never make it past 10 hrs or so.

Not every game is made for you."
Gorogoa,you think cyberpunk is a fail because of first week youtube videos and headlines. mostly everyone that plays the game says it is on track to becoming a no man's sky type revive
Gorogoa,Cyberpunk absolutely does not have better writing…
Gorogoa,no reason to skip one of the greatest games of this generation
Gorogoa,"How is it overrated, there’s no game that has that level of detail, i can understand not enjoying the slow paced gameplay, but you can’t deny that no game has pushed the boundaries of open world like red dead in terms of immersion."
Gorogoa,sure buddy go play ludo
Gorogoa,You're getting hate but it's true. RD2 felt more like an interactive movie than a game.
Gorogoa,"For reference, I have played both and love both, I even lean towards rdr2, but I am recommending based on OP's interests, unlike most of you"

Gorogoa,I’ll be honest I thought RDR2 was a tedious piece of trash and nothing like the first game. Cyberpunk   Is more fun and you’ll want to play it more.
Gorogoa,"Cyberpunk is getting a big expansion in September, along with a huge update that overhauls the whole game pretty much. Definitely hit RDR first and then grab cyberpunk after the update sometime."
Gorogoa,Great story.  Great gameplay.  Great experience overall.
Gorogoa,"I think it has some serious flaws but most of those flaws are in line with the vision of the game rather than being oversights. Like all the animations and forced walk sections, or the controls not being very arcadey with no jump button. The main flaw that defies this rule is the absurdly on-the-rails quests, which are typical for Rockstar.

All of that being said, it was in many ways a masterwork. Unparalleled attention to detail. Felt great to explore and discover. Could sink absurd hours into it or just pick up and play, and either way is fun. I find myself coming back to it all the time and finding things I missed.

It was imo the first Open World to feature both breadth and depth in world design without being riddled with bugs. You can tell the crunch went into perfecting the details rather than throwing the game together.

Gameplay and story not revolutionary but consistently solid."
Gorogoa,It’s an absolute masterpiece.
Gorogoa,"I've played and beaten both, and I love both games. That being said RDR2 is a fucking masterpiece. I don't know any game I'd pick over rdr2 in a one on one."
Gorogoa,"It's probably the deepest and most fully realized open world ever crafted, filled with rich and compelling characters, emergent choices, and awesome things to discover. It's held up by many experts as one of the iconic examples of video games as art. But go off, chief. Contrarianism is all the rage."
Gorogoa,"It would be easier to list what components of RDR2 *do not* have depth:

Enemies - it's all pew pew guys across the board.

Mounts - it's all horses across the board.

As for narrative, gameplay, world building, world interaction, customization, side missions, character developments, npc interactions, etc. etc. etc., I could go on but I've given your clearly catty, insincere comment enough effort and time, maybe just become more interesting in the future and open up with a compelling point next time."
Gorogoa,September 26.
Gorogoa,Haha very true that was a Freudian slip!
Gorogoa,"If you can get it cheap then maybe but I don't think it's worth it, personally."
Gorogoa,Rdr1 is the only one I can think of
Gorogoa,GTA
Gorogoa,Death Stranding I suppose both tedious games but are top 3 for me
Gorogoa,Oh that’s good to know. And thanks for the correction
Gorogoa,No they plan to overhaul the ai and make other changes. (Better Skill tree for example)
Gorogoa,"In which case, the cheapest version. The ultimate edition just has online content iirc"
Gorogoa,"Is the story really good or are the characters just carrying everything? Playing rn and the story is kind of meh. Rockstar games never really had a great main story, but that is not necessary with all the fun.

Not saying I'm right, just how I am feeling right now."
Gorogoa,[deleted]
Gorogoa,"Many actually. And even as a huge fan myself, I understand that the pacing of that story is all over the place and many of my friends drop it after initial 2-3 snowy hours and I keep on trying to convince them."
Gorogoa,"When I was contemplating rdr2 I felt like you. I also was unsure about the horse riding mechanic, as I was used to GTA and using vehicles. And I was unsure I would enjoy the 1899 setting. But let me tell you, get this game! It’s so good. You will end up being fascinated with the world, including the horse riding."
Gorogoa,"I've tried to get into RDR2 multiple times, I really appreciate the quality and complexity of the game, but I just can't, because I find the entire cowboy setting to be boring and uninteresting."
Gorogoa,"The game was so good and complete at release, it didn’t need it."
Gorogoa,"There's a reason why they made auto aim the default in RDR2, because the combat is so clunky that it needs it"
Gorogoa,It’s a very boring gameplay that’s for sure.
Gorogoa,Mainly because the mission design and combat are so bad
Gorogoa,"I play on PS5, so I wouldn't know much about epic store vs steam. Maybe try asking on the Red Dead sub, they will probably give better answers than I could"
Gorogoa,You can mod pretty much everygame on steam just as well if not better than epic. Some games even have steam cumunity mods through the steam store such as l4d2. Really the only reason id choose epic over steam for anything is if epic is giving a game away for free and even them there are some cases where id still just rather buy it from steam.
Gorogoa,Good bot
Gorogoa,The freind i borrowed it from said the same thing so i guess it varied from person to person. My experience was a mess. Nothing game breaking in the sense that i couldn't progress but a lot of religing becouse i got stuck in terminals and uis. Also had this one where jackie always had his gun out no matter what animtion he was doing or where he was. Even had it on that mission where we coukdnt bring our guns. Nothing could have been done to fix that one just had to accept that that was jakie now for that playthrough
Gorogoa,"Im with this guy, never had any game breaking bugs in this game from day 1. Playing PC with a good gpu over on my end tho. If youve got a 30 series gpu or newer cyberpunk runs literally fine"
Gorogoa,Yeah thats one thing i can personally attest to it looks really good. Also it supports dlss 3 fram generation so it runs really smooth a 4000 series card.
Gorogoa,"This is a stupid fucking reply

Nowhere did they say that. They're allowed to criticise the controls of a game when someone asks for opinions on that game. Opinions from both sides are important when deciding whether to buy something or not."
Gorogoa,Never said it was.
Gorogoa,It's widely agreed the controls and combat are super clunky.
Gorogoa,"Opinions are opinions my dude, both games had amazing writing but I felt more connected to Cyberpunk."
Gorogoa,Guess the opinions are divided. I didn't like rdr2's writing very much. What was so great about it then?
Gorogoa,I agree about the level of detail. For sure it's impressive in that aspect. It's just soooo fucking slooow man. I almost didn't finish that game considering how tedious it was. I'm sorry.
Gorogoa,Ok
Gorogoa,"Tedious as f... imo. I almost didn't finish it, but the story got me through. Gameplay was the worst!"
Gorogoa,"Weird, I was raised by fast paced shooters and such and absolutely adored rdr2 despite its slower nature."
Gorogoa,"Want to cook some food? 10 minute animation per piece cooked. Want to loot something? 10 minute animation of you picking the body up. Want to skin an animal? 45 minute animation. Oh, and btw, you need hundreds of pelts if you want to do side content. It is the most ridiculous shit.

Everyone kept telling me I needed to get to chapter 2 to really get a feel for the game. I made it past chapter 2 and I still hate the game. Only now I'm past my refund window and hate it even more now.

Every mission is you riding with some member of your crew on horseback for 45 minutes while you get gigantic exposition dumps. RDR2 is the game you get when you distill the WORST parts of the GTA franchise down into a cowboy game.

This was the first game that was universally praised, in a genre I love, that I hated to it's core. It has me questioning whether or not i should even bother buying the last of us on PC."
Gorogoa,Where are details on the huge update? Can’t seem to find any but very interested
Gorogoa,Still playing cyberpunk on a console like ps5 is like playing in a ghost town. If OP has a decent rig he should definitely hit cyberpunk in September.
Gorogoa,"Wasn't this supposed to come out this month? I am very excited about the DLC, but I'll believe the release date once I've downloaded it."
Gorogoa,"Will they completely drop their sad excuse for an armor system, their sad excuse for a weapon system, and their sad excuse for a perk system? Oh wait… that’s like every system in the damn game. Would be silly to ask for that.

Edit: holy shit it looks like they are!"
Gorogoa,"I thought it was very visually impressive and well acted. Also the soundtrack fucking slaps. I love the soundtrack. It also usually managed to capture the intended vibe very well. But it wasn't very thought-provoking. And some of the side content just completely misses the mark. 

Cyberpunk is a lot less polished and pleasant. But some of the sidequests could have carried entire high-quality indiegames."
Gorogoa,"Trailing missions, long ass point a to point b travel, goofy ah shooting, extremely linear missions, breaking the games economy with that stage coach robbery mission. Can’t deny the flaws."
Gorogoa,Did not know a simple question was a clearly catty insincere comment....
Gorogoa,"Lol what a pathetically insecure reply. RDR2 has absolutely zero depth when it comes to gameplay, mission structure, level design, or npc interactions. It’s all shallow set dressing for a pretty decent story that would’ve worked better as a TV series. As an actual videogame, it’s average at best."
Gorogoa,"> I've given your clearly catty, insincere comment enough effort and time, maybe just become more interesting in the future and open up with a compelling point next time.

You’re right - how dare he ask a simple question about your favourite game?! The audacity of /u/ihave0idea0 knows no limits! 

Personally I find RDR2 wholly unappealing to me, mostly because what I’ve seen of the combat mechanics seems quite repetitive and more importantly not skill-based.  
But I also don’t like the Elder Scrolls series or Cyberpunk for the same reason, so this thread just isn’t for me."
Gorogoa,"Yeah, been through that. And online doesn't do it for me"
Gorogoa,I actually have that. Might give it a try
Gorogoa,Oh I’ll wait then damn okay thanks.
Gorogoa,Thank you very much.
Gorogoa,"It’s definitely more character driven than plot driven. It might take a while for the story to get going, but when it does, it’s really some of the best dramatic writing I’ve ever seen in anything. It’s worth sticking with for sure."
Gorogoa,"… that’s what a story is, a journey of characters through an arc. The plot of 99% of stories is the same basic shit."
Gorogoa,"Fair, I can’t seem to get into Witcher 3, despite being a huge fan of the lore and gameplay.

It just… feels so huge and cumbersome"
Gorogoa,Yeah the story feels very disjointed. You do like 5 completely unrelated main story missions and then eventually come across another mission that advances the story. How’s that a great story? I get that people like those unrelated main missions since they like long games and are willing to tolerate a somewhat disjointed story if it means a longer game. But you can’t tell me that’s a good story. A good story must have a good flow.
Gorogoa,Rdr2 is easily top 5 of last gen
Gorogoa,"Yeah it's not even gameplay.
Just high quality movie"
Gorogoa,Tried that but didn't get any answer. Other modding subreddits had no idea either. I guess I will try asking there again. Thank you very much.
Gorogoa,"Actually had a coupon on epic store, so wouldn't want it to go to waste. I have some other the list but would live to know if epic store version can be modded. The RDR2 subreddit seems kinda dead with most of the posts with no replies so I think I might not get one there either."
Gorogoa,Best bot
Gorogoa,">This is a stupid fucking reply

Exactly my thoughts lol.

I absolutely loved RDR2 but I can totally see how it can be boring for some people. In fact, I've seen plenty of comments on various subs saying exactly that, so I think it's important thing to highlight for OP."
Gorogoa,"It was cool at first but then I just got tired of it quick. I also work 50hrs a week with like 1 hour commute one way so I just don’t have time for slow games anymore. 
That being said getting off a horse just to pick something up every time is just an awful game play design."
Gorogoa,What a debby downer you are. Pessimistic much? Lol
Gorogoa,Valid
Gorogoa,"[Check it](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/147domj/everything_new_with_phantom_liberty_and_patch_17/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)

I’m pretty excited"
Gorogoa,It says September 26th on steam. Even if you don't get the DLC you still get access to the massive overhaul btw.
Gorogoa,I think the side content is amazing. Maybe some things could be better but it is very good
Gorogoa,"Yeah I get that but thought provoking is not what I expect from Rockstar, or any game outside of select RPGs.

It’s more like a great execution of a tried and true formula. If I wanted a thought provoking Western, I’d reread Blood Meridian, not play an open world game."
Gorogoa,There’s nothing thought provoking about Cyperpunk either
Gorogoa,They’re not flaws…  They’re features!
Gorogoa,Yeah rockstar hasn't improved it's gameplay since GTA San Andreas. It's a shame because visually and story wise the games are brilliant
Gorogoa,"It's not a simple question, it's probably the most highly praised game of the last decade, pretending that you know nothing about it whatsoever and have decided to randomly come to me to learn more about it is naive and stupid at best."
Gorogoa,"And this is the kind of dumbass mentality that went behind asking 'hurr, what kind of depth rdr2 got?'"
Gorogoa,"The OP asked which game should he play, not your emotional personal take that doesn’t help at all and literally NO ONE cares about"
Gorogoa,I hear you. Just the most similar gameplay I could think of. Basically the same game at a different time period with different technology.
Gorogoa,"Story wise, propably. Gameplay, definetly not."
Gorogoa,I dont see why not you wouldnt be able too. Modding alters your local files on your system so i feel like whichever store front you bought it from wouldnt matter. All the games ive ever modded were on steam but i never had to actually interact with steam to do it so i feel like the same processes would have worked even if i bought them from epic.
Gorogoa,"Fair enough, that horse thing is true"
Gorogoa,"Everyone I know loves this game. So I never criticize it around them, because I would feel like a debbie downer. It was just exciting to finally see someone else hate it."
Gorogoa,Everything he said is valid and he’s entitled to his opinion. That isn’t pessimism
Gorogoa,"The shredder of panda guy I’m replying to blocked  me, then reported me to Reddit for some kinda wellness check?? People are so weird.. wtf"
Gorogoa,"Thank you. 

Man I am hype now."
Gorogoa,I'm happy for you. That I didn't feel the same doesn't mean I want to take that away from you
Gorogoa,"I don't think thought provoking was something they were not trying to do. The story of the main characters in what is essentially a cult was compelling but just not for that long. 

Also looking at cyberpunk again. I think there are plenty of moments there that could be labeled thought provoking. 

Maybe I just wanted the wrong things from the game."
Gorogoa,"No? What about Joshua's quest line? Rivers quest line? The quests with the mayor and his wife? V's story, the different endings. Even the quest with the vending machine ends up asking some interesting questions."
Gorogoa,Let’s hope for gta 6 I personally didn’t like rdr2 as much as other people did for personal reasons but I still thought it was a fantastic game
Gorogoa,"Damn, you even double-downed on it.

People ARE allowed to not know everything about RDR2, man.

You clearly spend a lot of time thinking about your favourite video games - that’s fine, but you should realise that other people may have other interests and may actually not know much about it, if at all.

As I said I personally find the gameplay uninteresting (not sure how you can think it has a lot of depth, tbh) - and a game without good gameplay is just a bad game to me. Therefore I have little interest in Rockstar games in general, because their gameplay is usually super casual-oriented.

As for the rest of you description of the depth of the game, you used a bunch of buzz-words but didn’t actually explaining anything to the guy.

Good graphics, good story, world building, character development and voice acting are great, but if that’s all there is to it, I’d rather watch a movie or read a book tbh. Gameplay is where games are at for me, and a lot of people in general."
Gorogoa,"Did you mean to reply to someone else?

How am I the emotional one for replying to someone having a complete meltdown at the mère idea that someone didn’t know the alleged qualities of RDR2?

I explained why I thought that neither games thought of by OP were particularly good in my opinion. That’s very relevant to the discussion.

What’s the point of your needlessly aggressive comment that no one asked for and no one cares about, to use your own words?"
Gorogoa,Exactly. However I think my emotional investment was larger in rdr2. But time period doesn't really matter.
Gorogoa,"Thanks for the reply. Just wanted to make sure. Actually, I heard and experienced issues with modding, especially with Bethesda games in Epic Games Store. And in general have heard people saying that Epic store is pretty bad if someone wants to play with mods. Modding for me is one of the main and most fun things (especially in games like Skyrim) so sometimes no excess to mods can be a huge deal breaker for me."
Gorogoa,"""10 minute animation. 45 minute animation"". Yeah sure  that's real valid isn't it lol. Someone being overly negative and blowing something out of proportion is considered to be pessimistic to me. I never said he was wrong and couldn't have an opinion. I just called him a debby downer. I'm entitled to my opinion as well right?"
Gorogoa,"Hey, what didn’t you like about the side content? I guess hunting is kinda barebones"
Gorogoa,"Rivers quest was so boring. Go here, fetch this. Fetch that. Search the nephews room for clues. Snooze fest. It was nothing I haven’t seen before a million times. Most of the side quests were boring as hell. There were some cool moments, but thought provoking? Nah."
Gorogoa,"Don't care, didn't read; get more interesting and stop leaning on sarcasm as a crutch for your lack of personality."
Gorogoa,Continue with your non contributions. Op asked which game and here you are just wasting thread space
Gorogoa,If you want to rant about how terrible RDR2 is make your own post
Gorogoa,"Your making comments on someone’s character over a game, if anything you’re a Debby downer"
Gorogoa,"Some of the sidequests were kinda stupid and unsatisfying. The one that stuck in my mind the most was the one where you encounter that woman who takes advantage of two guys with disabilities and the ark of the story is that the guys don't want to be with her because she's an absolutely horrible, abusive human being. Then when you find them they realise that they're still gonna go with her. 

Like what's the point? I had no input, the ark of the characters was to learn to put up with an abuser and it took like 20 minutes. 

&#x200B;

Not to say that I encountered no good sidequests. The one where you help a woman learn to live in the forest was lovely. But the game to me was littered with moments that ended in an unsatisfying anticlimax."
Gorogoa,"Very interesting. What did you think of >!
Jackies funeral? !<"
Gorogoa,"That comes from the guy that screeched and had a complete meltdown when someone else dared ask which kind of depth RDR2 had, because how dare he not know your favourite video game.

There is 0 irony in my last comment, btw! Not that I would expect you to understand irony…

Lmfao, reddit basement-dweller moment."
Gorogoa,"What’s YOUR contribution, lad? What’s your purpose? Why are you commenting?

As I said above, I explained why I thought neither of the games were particularly good in my opinion. That’s highly relèvent on a sub where people ask whether they should buy specific games.

My comment is on topic. Yours aren’t and are just useless attacks with 0 contribution on the actual subject. Are you perhaps an alt of the other guy? That’s the o my way this would make sense, tbh. You’re weird"
Gorogoa,"Ranting? For a whole 2 lines? Do you even know what a rant is? Open a dictionary ffs

The guy above had a meltdown when someone asked a simple question, I pointed out to him that no everyone necessarily liked every game or knew everything about every game.

That’s highly relevant to the conversation.

Once again, what is YOUR contribution here, apart from attacking me for no reason?"
Gorogoa,You're making comments about my character over a reddit post. A bit hypocritical.
Gorogoa,"Well, I didn't realize they had disabilities. Maybe I'm just stupid. I'm guessing your talking about the one where you had to keep punching and kicking those guys to prove which one was stronger? 

I saw it as funny, and I never saw them go back to her, I don't think I ever saw them after their final mission.  


Maybe I just didn't find them or I'm stupid. Oh well, I enjoyed those missions, and yeah that one with charlotte (woman in forest) was great."
Gorogoa,Getting his bike was the best part
Gorogoa,"No, you were in fact, weird because no one cares what you don’t like. I was genuinely interested in seeing how much people loved one game over the other but here you are."
Gorogoa,I already gave my contribution
Gorogoa,"My contribution was that I love both games but I feel like RDR two gets the one here because not only is it one of the greatest games of all time, but the story is pretty impactful"
Gorogoa,My context might seem illiterate because I am using voice to text
Gorogoa,"I think we're talking about another quest.  I googled it, it's called ""the smell of grease paint""."
Gorogoa,"Intruiging. I absolutely love that quest for how real it feels. 
>! How it takes the time to mourn and speak to the people that this affected. Presenting a death so realistically gave so much validity to the rest of the world. It made me remember times I've lost people. 
Death in video games is never presented like this. !<"
Gorogoa,"That sounds like a you issue, tbh

- Some people love one game more than the other

- some people prefer the other one

- some people like neither of them

These are all valid opinions on the exact same subject. I’m in the third camp, for reasons that I explained. I would therefore recommend OP to buy neither of these games if the reasons I gave resonate with him.

It’s hilarious that you don’t see that my comment is very much on topic for this thread - logic isn’t your forte, huh"
Gorogoa,"Clearly not in this chain of comment, which is why I’m asking you what you’re even doing here."
Gorogoa,"Fair enough! That’s understandable.

My contribution was that I didn’t like either of them for the reason stated above (gameplay isn’t interesting or skill-based enough, and that’s what matters most in games in my opinion), and therefore wouldn’t recommend either of them.

Don’t you see how my opinion is just as valid as yours? Again, why are you commenting here?"
Vampire Survivors,Might as well get stalker gamma for free
Vampire Survivors,"I would recommend getting S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Call of Pripyat. I understand that the choices are between Vampire Survivors or S.T.A.L.K.E.R Shadow Of Chernobyl, but hear me out. With the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Call of Chernobyl mod you can get all the areas from the previous S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, the quality of life improvements included in all three games, and the story from the first game."
Vampire Survivors,"Okay so take what I say with a grain of salt:  


I've only been playing Vampire Survivors for an hour or two, but it's pretty simple imo. I've found a  mobile game or two that offers essentially the same gameplay loop, but free.  
Their latest patchnote mentions adding a secret, so maybe I'm just a dumbass who hasn't found most of the game yet, but nonetheless."
Vampire Survivors,"I mean, if Stalker's on sale right now, might as well go for that, and then just pick up Vampire Survivors later, since that's always going to be super cheap anyway.

Though honestly, if you're having trouble getting together 4 bucks to get both, it might not be the best idea to spend that little money on video games anyway, and instead just wait until you're better off financially"
Vampire Survivors,You don't need CoP for this. All modern Stalker overhauls are free standalones.
Vampire Survivors,"You see the thing is I'm doing well enough because I'm still in college and money isn't really all that big a problem, that being said I want to buy on my own dime and not that of my parents and right now this is all I've got. Plus I don't leave in the US 4$ isn't exactly an inconsequential amount to me."
Citizen Sleeper,"I can neither recommend nor reject anyone buying Star Citizen. 

If you're asking here you're at the opening of the rabbit hole. If you choose to enter this rather strange dimension. The best piece of advice I got about whether or not someone should get into star citizen was. 

If your considering buying star citizen, buy what the game is right now. Not the dream of what it could be one day. 

CIG is a company with a massive scope and a desire to create something the likes of which have never been seen before. Full disclosure no one knows if they'll ever actually pull it off. 

Most of that is the dream. Figure out what the game offers right now and determine if that is something that interests you right now. 

You know yourself. You understand your tolerance for things.  Determine if what star citizen is right now is something that fits into that. 

If you want live content and gameplay of the current build. I recommend checking out 
Berks 

Moist_noodle 

The Dark Law 

Bognogus 

They all stream on twitch regularly and are all interactive with chat. Dark Law does a lot of racing and is a really good pilot. But it's a good example of what the flight model of the game can be pushed too. Berks has a lot of info on YouTube and several guides for beginners. 

Moist and bog are just really nice guys. 

Good luck on making your decision. I hope I helped in some way."
Citizen Sleeper,"I can’t recommend it in its current state, though everyone’s experiences seem different. 

At the moment I can’t buy and sell in game items, complete missions, equip items looted from bodies, or reliably get into the seat of my vehicle without needing a trip to the hospital. 

Prior to this most recent update it was great. So who know."
Citizen Sleeper,"People like to call it a scam (pointing to a really long dev time which is over 10 years at this point while the game is still in what it considers an early alpha phase) but I wouldn't say that's accurate. I'll admit I've put way too much money in to it (at this point more than 1000 USD, but I did so not really expecting much or putting myself in any financial strain), but I don't follow it too closely, only popping in for a few hours every few patches and I have seen slow but steady progress. Whether they'll actually manage to put out what could be considered a finished product, however, is hard to say.

They occasionally do free fly events which let you try out the current live alpha for free which is where I'd probably start. How buggy it is varies from patch to patch and things are still pretty bare bones."
Citizen Sleeper,"I love Star Citizen (I get downvoted to oblivion every time I say that). 

That being said, it's not for everyone. I also love NMS but while sounding similar on paper, they are very different games. 

SC has free fly times a few times a year. Definitely try it out free first. 

Also go to the telemetry page and see how well your system can run it."
Citizen Sleeper,"If you have friends or are willing to make friends the game is for you. It’s best enjoyed with others as the bugs for the most part tend to not be gamebreaking, but it can be not so fun to take on alone"
Citizen Sleeper,"So for a causal gamer of sorts, is it worth grabbing even for a game where I play for couple hours every week during college?"
Citizen Sleeper,"Maybe? I do think SC will tick most if not all of the things you listed as things you like, but, honestly, I find it hard to recommend anyone buying in to the game, even if I think it'd be right up their alley. I'd say wait for a free fly event and get some time in game before you make a decision."
Citizen Sleeper,Sounds good thanks! I’ll keep following the game lightly and see what comes of it
Ikaruga,RDR2 is an absolute triumph. It MUST be played.
Ikaruga,"I would generally recommend RDR2, which is one of the best games ever made.

Presentation is absolutely stunning across the board. Graphics, SFX, music, voice acting, all are absolutely stellar.

Gameplay-wise is also phenomenal. Essentially, to summarise, it plays as a 3rd-person shooter, with some RPG and simulation elements - it really shines in making you *feel* like the character you're playing as, that is, a cowboy in the late 19th/early 20th century, with all the gambling, outlawing, hunting, etc.

The content available is frankly some of the best value in any videogame. This is the most well-realised open-world game ever, in my estimation - an immersive world that feels natural and alive, that exists independently of you but reacts to your decisions. The story is fully fleshed out, dramatic, personal and intimate, but also self-aware enough to shine all the wild west tropes through. You have further an entire online mode that I haven't even touched yet.

When considering the preferences you laid out, I'm even more convinced you'll enjoy it. I'd recommend it over cyberpunk to anyone, but even more to someone with your preferences."
Ikaruga,"RDR2 is probably the better made game but I also loved Cyberpunk, it’s story, and it felt very creative and new. I liked someone else’s idea of doing RDR2 and buy Cyberpunk when DLC comes out so you can transition straight to DLC"
Ikaruga,"Love both, but I’d start with RDR2 buddy. And just know, it’ll be awhile before you start Cyberpunk once you get immersed into that work and Aruthur"
Ikaruga,U can miss cyberpunk. U cant pass on RDR2! Easy as that
Ikaruga,"Rdr2 without a doubt. The most beautiful open world, lots of chill out time, lots of random and very well written scripted quests, a sense of history with a bit of the absurd, and a tragic crime family story. It will give you a thrill, make you feel like a badass, and then leave you in tears."
Ikaruga,"I’m sure there will be a Complete Edition for Cyberpunk/Phantom Liberty, so wait on that. Cyberpunk was great; loved the story, Night City and the RPG elements. Granted I played on PS5 when that version was released. 

Red Dead Redemption II is one of the greatest games ever made. Five years later and it’s still worth full price. The quantity and quality of content is impressive."
Ikaruga,RDR2
Ikaruga,"As someone that was super hyped cyberpunk and hit it day 1, as faulty and buggy as it was at the time on my ps4, I enjoyed it, and now 100 times better with the next gen update and all on my ps5, that being said, RDR2 was one of the best games of the last generation, and it plays great on next gen consoles… definitely recommend RDR2, it’s not an rpg but getting lost in that world and along with the things you discover in it are very rpg like to me, definitely recommend RDR2"
Ikaruga,"RDR2.

Cyberpunk is cool, but it will be much cooler in a few months with the update/remake

I also would only get cyberpunk if you have at least a PS5/next gen/pc"
Ikaruga,Red dead redemption until cyberpunk dlc is released
Ikaruga,"No question, RDR2 all the way!"
Ikaruga,"I feel like RDR2 is a much better overall game, but is more divisive than you would be lead to believe. It's a slow burn story game, so if you're cool with that, it's way better.

Cyberpunk is exactly as you expect it to look and feel."
Ikaruga,"Cyberpunk base game is also been a lot of improvements when the DLC releases so get cyberpunk then with the DLC, for now its time for RDR2 Boah!!"
Ikaruga,RDR2
Ikaruga,RDR2 without a doubt
Ikaruga,"Red dead, even though I mostly play rpgs. Even though it’s fairly polished now I just find Cyberpunk to be boring. Idk I hope someday I can engage with it but it’s not now."
Ikaruga,"RDR2

Cyberpunk is also a very good game, and I do recommend you play it eventually

But with the DLC just around the corner (only three months away in fact) you should wait until it releases before getting it"
Ikaruga,"Wait for the DLC and play RDR2 while you wait. I personally liked Cyberpunk more, but RDR2 is amazing aswell."
Ikaruga,"Rdr2 and I liked both of them, but RDR2 is on another level"
Ikaruga,Rdr2
Ikaruga,"RDR2 is the most polished game I have ever played. The environments are highly-interactive and the world with it’s animals and people respond to you and each other in a very believable way. It’s story is an engaging epic action-drama grounded in reality. It’s extremely immersive.

CP2077 had very rough beginnings and, when I last played it late last year, that roughness still shows through on what otherwise feels like quite a nice game. Everyone knows about the bugs, so there’s no point mentioning them more here.  The physical environments and sound design are very well set up. But the NPCs populating the world will behave in ways that might break your immersion. When a gun is fired, they will all crouch in the same animation and despawn as soon as you aren’t looking. Police will spawn in on top of you when you commit a crime and don’t put up any chase when you flee. Feels disappointing in a world constructed around the notion of constant police-gang struggle. Supposedly this is slated to be reworked in the future.
The world has some interactivity more on par with games like dishonored 2. Dialogue feels particularly strong and the story is, in my experience, engaging. 
One strange thing is the character customisation. One premise of the world building is ‘fashion over function’. How you look is supposedly as important as how you act on the world of 2077. But this is totally at odds with the actual game mechanics. You will be heavily encouraged to wear clothes for their stats, not their appearance, and that will lead to some pretty weird costume combos. It doesn’t matter much because the game is entirely first person perspective, but that begs the (controversial?) question of why have a player model at all."
Ikaruga,Yes red dead redemption is much better on many levels right off the bat.
Ikaruga,Rdr2
Ikaruga,"Rdr2 100%. In my opinion it’s the best/most realistic video game ever made. The only downside is it’s ruined every game I’ve played after it. Either the graphics look terrible, the story is dumb, gaming mechanics aren’t as good etc.."
Ikaruga,"Hands down, RDR2. While I enjoyed Cyberpunk for what it is, I don't think that's a close call by almost any metric."
Ikaruga,"Red Dead Redemption 2 by far; I 100% Cyberpunk 2077, I did not 100% Red Dead.  Cyberpunk doesn't not have a lot of depth, unfortunately, its presentation is good and certainly has gotten better since launch but literally the only time I would even talk about it in the same breath as RDR2 is a question like yours, in terms of quality and depth and content, it doesn't hold a candle to RDR2.

There is of course a difference in setting to consider, but just keep in mind that while the 'cyberpunk' aesthetic is certainly present in Cyberpunk 2077, I'd argue it doesn't even do it as well as games like Shadowrun for SNES or Shadowrun for Genesis.  That may seem harsh, but again I did everything you could do in this game, it really doesn't have much going for it."
Ikaruga,RDR2
Ikaruga,"I would wait for the the dlc for Cyberpunk as it seems it will be some kind of mega side quest and will bring improvements to the base game as well, rdr2 is hit or miss I guess depending on people, it's a slow paced game but amazing visuals, story and immersion but with that said I finished cyberpunk and still will come back for the dlc, the game has a pretty big replayability if you like trying different approach to combat"
Ikaruga,"If you don't mind a slow burn for massive payoff then go for RDR2. You'll want to wait to play CP2077 until Phantom Liberty releases as they're doing an overhaul of the base game too.

Edit: Liberty not Pain"
Ikaruga,RDR2
Ikaruga,"No, it's not Next-Gen Optimized, but still RDR2 all day every day"
Ikaruga,"RDR2 is the superior game in my opinion. Cyberpunk is pretty bland in comparison. However, Cyberpunk has better performance in that, it can run at 60 fps on next- gen consoles (whereas RDR2 is locked at 30 fps) and is better optimized on PC, though still expect bugs. Also, RDR2 can be overwhelming with its size and detail, Cyberpunk is much smaller in scale."
Ikaruga,RDR 2 if you like a beautiful masterpiece
Ikaruga,"I just started RD2 on PC about a week ago and it’s absolutely sensational.

I do plan on getting CP after the new DLC comes out tho, and after I finish the main story in RD2!"
Ikaruga,You like computers or cowboys?
Ikaruga,"Seems like they’re going to add lots of fixes to the new gen consoles version of cyberpunk along with the expansion, so I think you should play RDR2 until a much better version of cyberpunk is out."
Ikaruga,RDR2.
Ikaruga,Red Dead Redemption 2
Ikaruga,"Wait for the Dlc of Cyberpunk, the game will get a massive overhaul with it"
Ikaruga,"RDR2 is the most polished game I have ever played. The environments are highly-interactive and the world with it’s animals and people respond to you and each other in a very believable way. It’s story is an engaging epic action-drama grounded in reality. It’s extremely immersive.

But the NPCs populating the world will behave in ways that might break your immersion. When a gun is fired, they will all crouch in the same animation and despawn as soon as you aren’t looking. Police will spawn in on top of you when you commit a crime and don’t put up any chase when you flee. Feels disappointing in a world constructed around the notion of constant police-gang struggle. Supposedly this is slated to be reworked in the future.
The world has some interactivity more on par with games like dishonored 2. Dialogue feels particularly strong and the story is, in my experience, engaging. 
One strange thing is the character customisation. One premise of the world building is ‘fashion over function’. How you look is supposedly as important as how you act on the world of 2077. But this is totally at odds with the actual game mechanics. You will be heavily encouraged to wear clothes for their stats, not their appearance, and that will lead to some pretty weird costume combos. It doesn’t matter much because the game is entirely first person perspective, but that begs the (controversial?) question of why have a player model at all."
Ikaruga,"RDR2 is the most polished game I have ever played. The environments are highly-interactive and the world with it’s animals and people respond to you and each other in a very believable way. It’s story is an engaging epic action-drama grounded in reality. It’s extremely immersive.

Ikaruga,Red Dead 2
Ikaruga,RDR2 duh. CP2077 world and setting is unlike anything I've seen before so that's why I liked it but the story and gameplay was just ok to me.
Ikaruga,"RD2 

Wait for cyberpunks expansion and then get it. It’s a good game on its own. Think Skyrim but in a cyberpunk setting. Yes is failed on some major systems they were supposed to have. Supposedly they are reworking a ton which will drop with the new expansion in September"
Ikaruga,Red Dead. Definitely Red Dead.
Ikaruga,RDR 2 hands down!
Ikaruga,rdr2 for sure!
Ikaruga,Rdr2
Ikaruga,"I might get some hate, but i enjoyed cyberpunk way more than i did rdr2. Maybe rdr2 was too tedious for me, or i didnt like the setting so much. Not sure, still a masterpiece though. 
Still id get cp2077"
Ikaruga,Red Dead Redemption 2
Ikaruga,RDR2. By a mile!
Ikaruga,"There has recently (as in, this weekend) been an article about the Cyberpunk DLC. Along side it is an overall of almost every system. The state its in now, Cyberpunk is *fine.* The open world feels so dead and empty, with nothing ever changing. You can stand and watch a NPC for 5 hours, and they will not move from there spot. The gunplay is fantastic, and the story is good, although that's of course subjective) I think part of that will be changing, along with the many other little tweaks they will be making, along side adding the DLC. So I would hold off. 

&#x200B;

RDR2, in contrast is amazing. The story, combat, graphics are wonderful and I don't have much bad to say about the game. My only complaint is the pacing of the story. It drags on a little to much, but at the same time, that's kind of the point? So It seems a weird complaint. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, TL;DR- Buy RDR2, Hold of on Cyberpunk until the DLC is released"
Ikaruga,Red dead 2. That game is forever in my heart
Ikaruga,"If you like RPG games, go for cyberpunk. But if you want an experience go for RDR2. Many people say that rdr2 doesn’t have a good story, but I believe that it is amazing. But I think everyone will agree that rdr2 has the best protagonist of all time, Arthur Morgan."
Ikaruga,[deleted]
Ikaruga,"It took me almost 70h to complete the main story in RDR2 that is without any side missions or free roaming.

Done the cyberpunk main story a lot of side quests and done some free roaming all under 50h"
Ikaruga,Both are great but I'd wait for Cyberpunk fixes and qol that come with the expansion so RDR2 first
Ikaruga,"RDR2 is probably the better made game but I also loved Cyberpunk, it’s story, and it felt very creative and new. I liked someone else’s idea of doing RDR2 and buy Cyberpunk when DLC comes out so you can transition straight to DLC"
Ikaruga,"I completed cyberpunk 3x with lowered graphics and shit fps. (Roll on phantom liberty with a 3080)

I didnt finish RDR2s first? Second? Act.

Dont get me wrong, I think RDR2 is an amazing game, probably the better one, but these are the facts lol."
Ikaruga,Rdr2.  Then In September you can get CP when it gets somewhat overhauled by developers
Ikaruga,Why is that even a question? RDR2 should be the default answer to this.
Ikaruga,Get both honestly. They are both masterpieces of games. I personally enjoy Cyberpunk a lot more but they are both fantastic in terms of story and gameplay.
Ikaruga,Cp 2077
Ikaruga,"I'd go with RDR2 first and, depending on how much free time you have, by the time you're done with it there'll probably be some version of Cyberpunk with Phantom Liberty included. Either way you'll have a great time with both, enjoy!"
Ikaruga,"I admit that rdr2 is the better made game,  I just got bored by it.  Cyberpunk was way more fun and engaging to me. I played on a pretty good pc, and didn't really have any expectations going into the game,  so I wasn't soured by anything.

Rockstar games kinda just bore me tbh. After playing the ps2 gta games to death,  any Rockstar game after just feels like it plays the exact same."
Ikaruga,I love Cyberpunk and never had bug issues. You should 100% get red dead as it’s probably the best game ever created.
Ikaruga,Red Dead Redemption 2 is already a complete game. Cyberpunk still needs polishing and should be even more solid after the expansion comes out in September. RDR2 will hold you until then.
Ikaruga,"if u have a series console, ps5, or high end pc, get cyberpunk for 30$ plus the expansion for another 30$. if u don't have that, then id say RDR2"
Ikaruga,"Have both and played both.  
RDR2 is super immersive and so finely tuned - but it is an open world Rockstar game so it's going to be a bit overwhelming, at least it was to me.  
Cyberpunk is also open world but a bit more linear.  It has that Skyrim like maneuverability where things can get wonky but it allows the player more freedom. 

I'd say go for cyberpunk and just play it now so you have an understanding of the game and story before the dlc comes out."
Ikaruga,"I have both.

Cyberpunk is more of RPG style than RDR2. There's skill points and such to distribute. RDR2 increases stats for you based on what you do.

Cyberpunk's AI have health bars, red dead's doesn't. It's more immersive for that reason.

RDR2 is much slower pace, but has a lot more to explore. The scenery can be breath-taking and sometimes hard to fathom how good it looks. 

Cyberpunk has a lot of nothing, but it still looks pretty cool. Nice graphics.

So far, I like cyberpunk's story but it can seem a bit all over the place.

RDR2 has been easier to follow."
Ikaruga,"If you just want a decent story with an immersive world and nice graphics, RDR2 is fine for that. It has pretty terrible gameplay, and it's a brain-dead easy game that treats players like they have 60 IQ. If you just want to turn off your brain for 60-hours and play through a decent story, then it fits the bill. Especially if you like the wild west and spaghetti western movies, then you will probably like RDR2. 

Cyberpunk has way better art direction than RDR2, but the game is severely lacking in terms of a lot of its open world systems. It has nowhere near as immersive of an open world as RDR2. The setting and visuals are a lot cooler, but the actual execution isn't there. The combat is not very good, but it's at least better than RDR2 in this area. It also has RPG systems and build variety which RDR2 doesn't have. Overall I'd say just wait until the DLC drops, because apparently they have reworked a lot of aspects of the game. CP2077 really does have a lot of potential, so if the DLC lives up to the hype, then it could be a game changer."
Ikaruga,I just tried cyberpunk a couple weeks ago off a freinds familyshare and its still super buggy to the point where i wound up getting fed up with the bugs and uninstalling. I would have felt very cheated if it was a game i payed for. So i would go with RDR2
Ikaruga,"Everyone says RDR2 is the best game ever, but the janky controls are super frustrating and honestly it’s pretty slow at times. I don’t need to watch long animations every time I pick something up or do anything. It’s more cowboy sim than game. 

Tried it 3 times and never make it past 10 hrs or so."
Ikaruga,[deleted]
Ikaruga,Both
Ikaruga,Mount a blade bannerlord has great rpg mechanics you can literally be anything in that world
Ikaruga,I would only choose Cyberpunk solely because it has next gen support. RDR2 is a fantastic game but lacks that kind of support which makes me personally not touch it ever since I beat it back in 2018.
Ikaruga,"RDR2. It’s a much more immersive game and story. Cyberpunk is a great game too, but I don’t find the story as good at all. The pros about cyberpunk are extreme weapon customization and playstyle customization with perk trees. When I play RDR2 I feel like I’m in the story, and when I play Cyberpunk I feel like I’m in a gigantic beautiful sandbox game."
Ikaruga,Cyberpunk
Ikaruga,"RDR2 is much more story rich and interactive compared to cyberpunk. It only takes around 30 hours to complete the main mission, spoiler alert ( when doing the last mission after doing so you get back to prior of starting the last mission to finish anything else to basically you don't fully finish it). It has nice features, ray tracing, and a nice environment, but RDR2 beats it in every other way. That's from my opinion as i have both and played both for 100 hours plus on each."
Ikaruga,"Cyberpunk has better writing and combat. Rdr2's world is more detailed, alive and polished. 
I prefer cyberpunk.
Most people seem to prefer rdr2."
Ikaruga,"RDR2. Ive played both and Cyberpunk really lacks in a lot of areas and i didn’t get much enjoyment from it after completing the main story line. RDR2 however is a game that ive replayed numerous times and spent upwards of 400 hours combined playing, most of it in free roam. Havent even touched the online yet."
Ikaruga,"Cyberpunk's DLC will remain as a DLC, it seems to be set in a new city, but at this point, nothing can be done about the game's dullness and how unfun it is to play. I played it for 25 hours(right until the 3-race side mission were unlocked), and it's just boring, the plot is mediocre, the fighting, the gameplay are subpar, the only redeeming thing was how beautiful everything looked, and that's it"
Ikaruga,I would be cautious with RDR2 on PC. I had to get a refund on it due to the game constantly crashing; the issues had to do specifically with the Rockstar games launcher which you are required to use.
Ikaruga,"Rdr2 is a bit of an ancient game in terms of design. Missions force you to do things one way and if you don’t listen the game fails you. It’s also an aggressively easy game that just feels stiff and clunky mechanics wise. It’s got great voice acting, but I found the world and story pretty dull. Cyberpunk is a far more enjoyable game that gives you choices on how to handle each mission with much better combat and a much more interesting world to explore and a far more interesting story."
Ikaruga,"This is a hard one, gotta do both haha"
Ikaruga,neither buy rain world 😈😈
Ikaruga,RDR2 no contest
Ikaruga,"Depends, if you're on console I would skip RDR2, it still runs at 30FPS, rockstar doesn't care about next gen update."
Ikaruga,"Neither, buy doom eternal"
Ikaruga,I dont like rdr2 at all and like project red games
Ikaruga,Cyberpunk. Red dead 2 is overrated imo
Ikaruga,They’re both great go with what interests you more.
Ikaruga,I've played both and I have some stronger critiques on RD2 than most but would still pick it over CP.
Ikaruga,"Both games are amazing, i loved Cyberpunk it's story characters, scenery. currently playing RDR2 its really good, both games are great. I'd buy both if i were u"
Ikaruga,Robots and guns or cowboys and guns
Ikaruga,"I’d go for Cyberpunk personally. The game is really good as long as you take your time and do the side quests. There are a ton of really compelling stories that get told. I’d wait to play until Phantom Liberty releases though. The gameplay is already good, but it’s rumored they’re going to be shipping big improvements to key systems like the AI and the police systems (and possibly more) with the DLC."
Ikaruga,I recommend getting both
Ikaruga,"Both are incredible story games, depends on what you want. If you care about story and characters, go red dead, if you care about combat and replay ability go cyberpunk"
Ikaruga,"Rdr2, 100000%"
Ikaruga,Cyberpunk if you want action. Red dead if you don't mind watching a movie in game format.
Ikaruga,Rdr2 cyberpunk has a lot of problems
Ikaruga,RDR2
Ikaruga,Red dead partner!
Ikaruga,Red Dead is the better game hands down.
Ikaruga,RDR2
Ikaruga,Do you want to be a cowboy? If so…follow your heart
Ikaruga,Cyberpunk has a big DLC coming soon.
Ikaruga,"With the Phantom Liberty expansion, which overhaul all of cyberpunk. It will great to buy...


But RDR2 is a moderm masterpiece so it gets my vote"
Ikaruga,"Cyberpunk is more action and adrenaline, Red Dead Redemption 2 is more laid back and slow-paced.  


Cyberpunk has been getting updates continually since release and is awesomely upgraded by this point...I never finished RDR2, but I finished Cyberpunk and am waiting at the edge of my seat for Phantom Liberty, which is going to be a *huge* DLC and should be later this year.  


Cyberpunk.  My two cents."
Ikaruga,"RDR2, it's much more detailed and alive rather than cyberprank, tho I enjoyed cyberprank (played from friend's console) its just not within the same level of RDR2 also the balancing of story telling and action on RDR2 is peak unlike in cyberpunk you're always just sitting and listening"
Ikaruga,I don’t usually post on reddit but i just want to make sure that you get RDR2
Ikaruga,"Both are great, but I think Cyberpunk is the more engaging game. Red Dead suffers from the antiquated Rockstar game design. Almost no freedom during missions, you’re just railroaded through each section and must play it as the developers intend."
Ikaruga,Red dead 2 is my pick. Cyberpunk was fun but i can’t just sit back and enjoy the world like i can with RDr2
Ikaruga,"In my opinion, Red Dead Redemption 2 was an incredible experience, especially in the beginning and middle game. However, I found myself getting bored after reaching around 60% completion, as there weren't many new things to explore once I had acquired the best weapon. 

On the other hand, Cyberpunk had superior writing and enjoyable gameplay, but it did suffer from some noticeable bugs."
Ikaruga,"RDR2 and anyone who says diff is crazy ive completed both games and theres just nothing that compares to RDR2 everything about it is so amazing but for me my fav thing about the game was the story telling. the best storytelling ive ever experienced in a game hands down. it could of been a oscar winning film. i literally cryed during a few scenarios in the game,"
Ikaruga,Lol EASY choice. RDR2.
Ikaruga,Are you on pc ? If you don’t wanna keep the games forever. I can tell you how to get them for like 2$ both on steam
Ikaruga,"I vote rdr, as well. BUT, if you haven't played Witcher 3, that's another great one. Plus, it often heavily discounted."
Ikaruga,RDR2 and its not even close
Ikaruga,"Red dead 2. There isn’t a game that has immersed me more than this game, I play butt nekkid and pretend I’m a O’Driscol. 10 Cowboys out of 10"
Ikaruga,"I’ve played both and loved both, but I fully believe that RDR2 is truly the best game ever, go with that first!"
Ikaruga,"Rdr2 is very pretty and has some interesting things in it but from a gameplay perspective it's unbelievably barren. You don't even get to aim your gun in this game really and all the missions are basically ""walk here, listen to dialogue, kill guys"".

Cyberpunk at least has some depth to combat. It's a passable first person shooter. Not a great one mind you, but it works. The missions here are also just ""walk here, listen to dialogue, kill guys"".

Personally the dialogue in both these games puts me to sleep and that's like 70% of both. But I guess I would say the Rdr2 dialogue at least feels finished, whereas the cyberpunk dialogue very frequently feels like a placeholder."
Ikaruga,RDR 2 is a no brainer in this case
Ikaruga,"Cyberpunk over RDR2. While RDR2 is a great game, i found it slow, and alot of the “immersive” mechanics being pretty surface level and just boring. Unpopular take, but Cyberpunk is more fun."
Ikaruga,I’d wait till the new expansion for CP2077 comes out. It’s supposed to bring a whole bunch of QOL changes to the base game.
Ikaruga,RDR2
Ikaruga,No
Ikaruga,"RDR2 was fun, but I was more hyped for Cyberpunk 2077. Ended up not caring for RDR2 so much after burning myself out on it, but Cyberpunk absolutely failed me in almost every department. RDR2 is the way to go."
Ikaruga,"Wait for the cyberpunk dlc to drop before you buy since they are redoing A LOT of the mechanics. I believe it’s September 26 so you have a lot of time to finish red dead. Plus the summer sale is soonish I think so you might be able to get the game and dlc for cheap depending on what price they set. 

I’ve played both and even though it’s been a while since I played cyberpunk and I just finished red dead 3 days ago both are excellent games in their own right but I’d probably play red dead before cyberpunk."
Ikaruga,**\*\*\* me scrolling through the comments to find the crazy psychopath that chooses cyberpunk over rdr2 \*\*\***
Ikaruga,Cyberpunk is fun but it doesn’t come close to RDR2.
Ikaruga,"It depends on what type of games you like, red dead is more story based and polished, but cyberpunk is more ""fuck around and break the game"", but in a good way

Cyberpunk has leveling and a skill tree, and rdr doesn't, so I think you'd like it more

Also red dead was built with miracles or something because it runs like a dream"
Ikaruga,[removed]
Ikaruga,Both games are really good but RDR2 is my favourite game all time so pick RDR2
Ikaruga,"Both are great, but RDR2 is looong but with lots of content"
Ikaruga,Rdr2
Ikaruga,Cyberpunk is more fun. RDR2 gets crazy tedious
Ikaruga,"Red Dead 2 is worth its weight in gold. The story is perfectly told, with some of the best voice acting I've ever heard in a video game. The world is vast, and you never feel like you're completely out of things to do. Bored of missions? Hunt some animals for upgrades to both your player or your camp. Tired of hunting? Put your criminal mind to robbing a store or train. Want to help the law? Check the local sheriff's office for a bounty. The list of activities goes on and on...


So to answer your question, take a break from the cybernetics and neon signs of Night City and go on a breathtaking journey through late 1800's America with Dutch Van der Linde and the gang!"
Ikaruga,"Go with red dead and play cyberpunk after the last dlc comes out. There will probably some sale for a definitive edition down the line.

Both games are definitely worth to be played."
Ikaruga,Do you prefer cowboys or cyborgs
Ikaruga,Finished Rdr2 3 times already and would pay 200$to forget everything and start the game again without remembering anything. Cyberpunk I enjoyed the story but the game was full of bugs and lost the interest of playing it again even if it is fixed or not
Ikaruga,"I played red dead 2 after it had been out for like 4 years not expecting much. I didn't even buy it, I played my brothers copy, that's the only reason I tried it. It turned out to be my favorite game ever. I'm not particularly interested in the wild west. It felt like watching a movie in the best way possible. It's the only game I can think of where I was sad because I knew it was ending soon. I can't recommend it enough.

I was excited for cyberpunk for years. I was incredibly disappointed when I finally was able to play it, I put about 20 hours in it and feel no urge to continue playing it. Even after they've patched it."
Ikaruga,"All you need to do is listen to the song ""Video games"" by Tenacious D. You're welcome."
Ikaruga,RDR2. Cyberpunk's getting totally reworked head to toe alongside new DLC in September and *that's* when you should buy it.
Ikaruga,RDR2
Ikaruga,rdr2
Ikaruga,RDR2!
Ikaruga,Hmph. Rdr2 is a masterpiece. Cyberpunk quite literally is bad. Phantom liberty sounds very promising on paper but we’ll have to see. So did this game pre release and I’d give it a 5/10.
Ikaruga,Is this post by OP a joke?
Ikaruga,RDR2
Ikaruga,"Rdr2 has a much stronger plot and cast. And the world is gorgeous.

Cyberpunk is also fantastic and a lot of fun, BUT it’s a lot more you having to role play the character"
Ikaruga,"Loved both, but like everyone has already said, start with RDR2. CP2077 is a fantastic game, but it will get better once the Phantom Liberty update comes out."
Ikaruga,Rdr2 all day. By far my fav game all time.. online sux d tho.
Ikaruga,I couldn't get into RDR2 personally. I was enjoying the story and it's the most beautiful game ever made but I thought the gameplay and controls were so rudimentary I stopped at Chapter 3. Meanwhile I really liked Cyberpunk especially the story and although its gameplay isn't groundbreaking it didn't stop me from finishing the game.
Ikaruga,"Red dead, no doubt."
Ikaruga,RDR2 is one of the best games humanity has ever witnessed
Ikaruga,"Most people are saying RD2, but my vote is for Cyberpunk. Bugs aren't as bad now, and the story is great. Along with a bunch of different builds. You can be a ninja with a katana, a run and gun madman, or a tech savvy hacker. The atmosphere is great and helps tie everything together, and the characters you meet really make it amazing. Just like all of CDPR's games, they really go all out with side quests and side story characters. Plus, Phantom Liberty releases in September, so if it's on sale, I would go for it. Cyberpunk is by far one of my favorites, and honestly, RD2 doesn't even get close to my top games.
That being said, both Cyberpunk and RD2 are both amazing games. I just lean more towards Cyberpunk."
Ikaruga,"I say pick up Cyberpunk, it might be worthwhile to play the game now, with the original story, before playing Phantom Liberty. As Phantom Liberty is very likely going to come with some new endings, and possibly some other changes outside the ones we already know.

Plus I just think its a good game, well worth the money nowadays after 1.5. Mods make it even more fun to play around with. Just an entertaining experience.

On top of that Cyberpunk is truly an RPG, it lets you choose your skills, pick different perks, use different weapons. You truly build your character the way you want. Its very similar to thinks likeSkyrim in that way. Where as Red Dead 2 is just the same character no matter what, there is no leveling system or anything. Its really more of an action adventure title than a true RPG. 

So if you want to get immersed into an RPG and its setting, in similar fashion to things like Skyrim, I recommend 2077."
Ikaruga,RDR2 with no hesitation and do not read spoilers.
Ikaruga,"Hey unpopular opinion time. I played both.

RDR2 is certainly a marvel. The story is amazing, graphics are second to none, the protagonist is probably the most well flushed out I've ever experienced in a game, and overall the game really is a must play.

....but it's a bit of a drag yeah? It's very slow paced, and I found myself just wanting to play other games from time to time. This isn't really a negative point, and is definitely subjective, but man it can DRAG. 



Cyberpunk (post patches) is a wild ride. The story is a blast, and really kicks. The set pieces are way above what I expected in an open world game. The side quests, as expected from CDPR are just as good, if not better than the main story in many cases. Definitely a case of art direction trumping graphical fidelity. While it doesn't look bad by any stretch... Walking though Chinatown in the middle of the night is a sight to behold. Vibrant neon lighting, crowded streets, some guy getting mugged in an alley, the constant cacophony of people shouting and talking... I haven't felt that level of immersion in a game... Maybe ever.

Yeah it's a bit of a mess. But way better than the sum of its parts. Unfortunately I listened to the online griping, and missed out for longer than necessary, but take from someone who was hesitant, it blew me away.

At the end of the day Cyberpunk is just ***fun***. The shooting is chunky and effective, the driving is arcady but feels good, the plot and characters are fucking bonkers, and there really are just so many ways to play the game.

I played it the first time as a learning curve. A little hacking, a little shotgun, a little melee. It was pure chaos and really felt like I was a newbie in night city trying to climb to the top.

Second time thru and I'm playing full stealth. Feels like a totally different game. I walk in an alley, activate my speed implant, turn invisible, and walk through putting a bullet in everyone's head. Come out the other side, and watch the bodies drop before the cameras ever had a chance to catch me. Suddenly I felt like an elite level assassin that was born and bred in this world.


You can't go wrong either way, but I tip towards CP"
Ikaruga,"cyberpunk, rdr2 is a linear game in an open world setting with the most boring chapter 1 in existence, also everything you do (pointless animation) is so slow and infuriating that you can fall asleep"
Ikaruga,I think rdr2 has more replayability if that matter to you as far as stretching your dollar. I dont find myself excitingly opening cyberpunk. I felt like 1 playthrough was enough to get a big grasp of the game.
Ikaruga,"Rdr2 is a masterpiece. It’s slow paced but if you adapt your speed to it, rather than trying to force it to your speed, it’s fantastic! It is the most alive environment of any game I’ve played. Can interact with just about everything too. And npc’s actually seem like they are more than objects moving around the screen."
Ikaruga,RDR2 is one of the greatest games ever made.
Ikaruga,"I have both. The answer is both. Just get both, play them both for less than two-hours each, and refund the one you don’t want."
Ikaruga,"Unquestionably RDR2 is the better, more fully realized game. 

I think the best question to answer from a prospective standpoint, however, is what is your preferred gaming experience? Do you like 'slow' as a concept? Do you enjoy being diverted from whatever you initially planned doing? If a game world is both fun and immersive, are you happy with killing an hour or two wandering around it and not focusing on story progression? If yes to all of the above, You will love RDR2. If you are very task oriented and want everything to be a quick hit, then RDR2 isn't going to be your cup of tea regardless of its (excellent) level of quality.

That's generally what people mean when they say this game is divisive. The less patient get frustrated with its deliberateness."
Ikaruga,Wait until the Cyberpunk expansion comes out at a discount. It will probably be in its best state at that point.
Ikaruga,"Red Dead 2 all the way. It took me like 3 attempts of replaying the beginning before I finally got hooked on the game and I wish it didn’t cause I’ve been missing out! 

It’s such a beautiful game. The guns are dope, (just experiment, you can’t lose unless you don’t like the gun which you can just store away) and the world is vast but alive

Like you’ll suddenly get ambushed or some fools will try to rob you; or woodcutters are felling trees, or a criminal is complaining on the back of a horse tied up"
Ikaruga,I played both RDR2 on s a great experience but a little slower pace. Cyberpunk was broke and I fell off before I completed it
Ikaruga,"Both are on sale pretty often but I would do RDR2 first without question. There are certain games you absolutely have to at least play. Don’t have to finish it if it don’t click but it’s an absolute must play. Cyberpunk is a great story with not the best gameplay, plus very raunchy. It’s gotten much better over the years however."
Ikaruga,Red dead 2 is leagues better imo
Ikaruga,Rdr2 is probably the best story in a game I have ever played. Full stop. It is genuinely one of the most amazing game stories there is. I would recommend it over cyberpunk based on that alone
Ikaruga,Red Dead 1st by far
Ikaruga,"Imo they are both very enjoyable from a story and gameplay angle. Some of it comes to taste (do you want a Wild West game or futuristic urban environment?). In my opinion you can’t go wrong but there is a reason Red Dead 2 is considered one of the greatest single player games of all time. 


Also, if this matters, cyberpunk is a 30-50 hour game if you complete the story and do a lot of side quests. Red dead 2 is more of a 50+ hour kind of game."
Ikaruga,RDR2
Ikaruga,I would say red dead now and cyberpunk later
Ikaruga,"Cause I don't play video games no more
Never play video games
But Red Dead Redemption 2, that is not a game
It's an incredible journey through old American history
Fighting for your life and fighting for your family
Try to live your days with honor and integrity
That's not a game, that's an adult thing
That's not a game at all
That's like fuckin' Shakespeare
- Jack Black"
Ikaruga,"Objectively RDR2 is the better game in almost every way, and it’s also cheaper right now. But man I can’t help but absolutely adore cyberpunk, even more than red dead. My brain says get red dead but my heart says get cyberpunk"
Ikaruga,"Cyberpunk is pretty cool, but RDR2 is a goddamn masterpiece."
Ikaruga,"If you like first person action RPG and sci -fi allot like I do Cyberpunk carried the magic. After the millionth plot twist I gave up on Rdr2, cyberpunk is short sweet and tragic."
Ikaruga,I would say get red dead. It honestly looks like the better game out of the two and you can always get a refund if you really don't like it.
Ikaruga,"Red dead 2, 100%"
Ikaruga,Could not put RDR2 down finished in under a month. Cyberpunk took me at least 4.
Ikaruga,99.9% of time my answer to this sub is just r/piratedgames
Ikaruga,rdr2 all the way
Ikaruga,Red Dead Redemption 2 !
Ikaruga,Rdr 2
Ikaruga,Both are amazing and should be played but get rdr2 first and wait till the new dlc to get cyberpunk.
Ikaruga,"RDR2 is to date the best single game I’ve ever played by far.

It’s a masterpiece."
Ikaruga,RDR2. Without a doubt.
Ikaruga,RDR2
Ikaruga,Do you want rootin tootin cowboy shootin or stressy messy cyborg depressy?
Ikaruga,"I love both, but cyberpunk is good and RDR2 is next level amazing."
Ikaruga,"In between missions, RDR2 is quite therapeutic to play."
Ikaruga,"Late to the party, but would like to share my thoughts:

CP2077 has some fantastic writing and beautiful graphics. That being said, it’s a very shallow game in every other department. Given the world-building, it has amazing potential. If they had just given the game another couple years to incubate, it easily could’ve been one of the greatest action-adventure RPGs of its time. 

RDR2 is, on the other hand, *also* a game that has fantastic writing and beautiful graphics. It is, however, the type of game that *did* get the time it needed to fully flesh out all the other aspects of its gameplay. The result is a highly immersive experience with a lot of replayability and content that can last you hundreds of hours."
Ikaruga,"It's not even really a fair comparison. 

RDR2 is a ridiculous rich and developed world with unbelievable detail (sometimes to much) and a story that is extremely engaging. It also has some of the best NPC reactions/interactions and is probably one of the top 3 hunting games in the last decade all rolled into one.

Cyberpunk is a mostly dead world with poor interactivity with npcs, a convoluted story that barely makes sense, and is almost entirely empty. I know I mentioned dead and empty twice but it needed repeating. The game had so much potential it didn't live up to its ridiculous. The games AI is almost as bad as basic vanilla skyrim back in the day. Luckily most of the bugs seem to have been dealt with but the game is still not worth buying in my opinion"
Ikaruga,I've played both. They're both pretty good. Rdr2 is the best of the 2.
Ikaruga,def red dead!
Ikaruga,I have never met someone who didnt like rdr2 but cyberpunk seems to be hit or miss i have friends who love it but i have had no enjoyment playing it at all
Ikaruga,"Cyberpunk is one of my all-time favourites, but Red Dead II is objectively the GOAT"
Ikaruga,RDR 2 and don't think twice. Cyberpunk is good but RDR2 is a masterpiece and goated.
Ikaruga,"I haven't played Cyberpunk yet, but RDR2 is a must play. I held off on playing RDR2 for a long time, due to people saying its slow paced. That was a mistake. I didn't feel slow to me, because the story is so good. If it was a movie, it would get an Oscar."
Ikaruga,Rdr2 first and then cyberpunk
Ikaruga,RDR2 no contest
Ikaruga,RDR2 is at minimum a top 10 all time must play game
Ikaruga,Red dead is wayyyy better than cyber.
Ikaruga,"10/10 ""wild west"" (kind of) open world with a 10/10 story or a, well, cyberpunk open world with a 9,5/10 story


your call"
Ikaruga,"Rdr2 is amazing. Cyberpunk is great and one of the better open world games I've played ever. I've played a lot of games and I adore this game. Wasn't perfect obviously with the console bugs but it's still great. If you're on pc then get it,next gen consoles then yeah. Previous gen then definitely no. 

After playing both, I can say both are great and damn good games. RDR2 is a masterpiece and Cyberpunk could one day end up being remembered as one. If not for the bugs and launch issues then kt would've been perfect imo"

Ikaruga,"Cyberpunk is one of the more fun games I've played in years.  Red dead redemption 2 is the single greatest game I've ever played. Play both, but start with red dead."
Ikaruga,How much is rdr2? I just bought it for $70? 😭😭😭😭
Ikaruga,Anyone who is a gamer must play RDR2
Ikaruga,Cyberpunk. That's just me though. This is really a question you need to ask yourself.
Ikaruga,"Well I would say both, but I would suggest leaving cyberpunk aside until Phantom Liberty comes out and you can experience it at its highest. So for now, I recommend Red Dead. It's very fun, finished it recently, couldn't put my controller down, one week of my holiday gone, spent 110 hours on the game. Just don't overwhelm yourself and don't rush too much with the story, just enjoy the game's atmosphere and its randomness and progress in the story in whatever way feels best to you.

If you worry about completionism, I recommend making a manual save for everytime you start a new chapter."
Ikaruga,Cyberpunk has finally gotten out of the shadow of its launch and is finally the game it was promised to be. But RDR 2 would be Rockstar’s masterpiece if the first game and GTA V didn’t already exist. Definitely check both games out but give Red Dead Redemption 2 a try first.
Ikaruga,I liked Cyberpunk a lot but RDR2 is the way to go
Ikaruga,Cyberpunk only because it going to get a overhaul that makes the game worth playing but red dead 2 is hella fun as well so wouldn't blame you if you got that over it since cyberpunk started off bad and kept people off it.
Ikaruga,RDR2. It has an amazing story.
Ikaruga,I haven't played Cyberpunk but RDR2 is such a masterpiece so that's my vote :)
Ikaruga,Red Dead Redemption is a masterpiece. Cyberpunk in its current state is fine but nowhere near RDR2 level.
Ikaruga,RDR2
Ikaruga,"I played both, and 110% would pick RDR2 over cyberpunk. I think I’ve replayed it 4 times now. Played through Cyberpunk once and haven’t felt much like going back. Just a richer story in RDR2."
Ikaruga,"i know everyone and their mom has already said it in this comment section, but i’m gonna add my voice to the choir anyways: rdr2 first, without a doubt."
Ikaruga,RDR2 is great. would never spend money on cyberjunk
Ikaruga,Rdr2 is slow as fuck cyberpunk is fast paced so i would go for cyberpunk (haven't been a fan of slow paced walking and riding Sims no matter how good the story is if they can't give it to me in a faster manner or keep me retained i ain't bout that)
Ikaruga,RDR 2
Ikaruga,"Wow, someone needs to rep cyberpunk here.  I loved it.  Best game of last 5 years for me.

Rdr2 was boring for me.  Scenery was pretty and all but I just found it repetitive.  Ride horse, shoot, do boring camp stuff, etc.  I dunno I like doing that stuff in real life.  

Cyberpunk is just super fun.  The soundtrack bangs.. you get swords implanted in your arms... the lore is super interesting.. lots of meaningful choices.  It's the only game I've ever replayed 

CP got a bad rap at launch.  I get it.  But on PS5 today it rocks"
Ikaruga,"Cyberpunk will have a GOTY edition either with Phantom Liberty’s release or shortly thereafter. Acquiring RDR2 right now makes more sense, at least to me."
Ikaruga,Buy rdr2 and when cyberpunk gets a complete edition buy that one later on
Ikaruga,Both are incredible. I would not recommend getting Cyberpunk on a PS4 as it just stops working for me after like an hour of play time. RDR2 is a considerably better game but both are worth it
Ikaruga,"Play RDR, then go to the second one - you won't regret it."
Ikaruga,"I'm playing Cyberpunk rn and while id say it is a very good game and looks incredible, it is still nowhere near as polished as RDR2, combat, movement, interactions, npcs, customization and most of the things that make an open world/exploration game good are better in RDR2 in my opinion. But id still recommend you to get Cyberpunk later, it is a great game."
Ikaruga,"Red dead 2, Cyberpunk isn't bad now, but RDR2 still has a good case for being the best game of all time."
Ikaruga,I would get RDR2 first. Its long game with a much better story imo. Plus cyberpunk is getting that expansion in a few months that'll be overhauling some gameplay mechanics.
Ikaruga,Cyberpunk.
Ikaruga,"Red dead’s storymode is god tier, online can be amazing, Cyberpunk is very good, Perosnally I’d say red dead if you’ll play the online, cyberpunk if ur not gonna play the online"
Ikaruga,"I say it depends on your system. I have a PS4 slim and cyberpunk is unplayable after the last large update. Gonna have to get a ps5 to actually play it. Could be my save corrupted somehow, but the game freezes after 20 minutes almost religiously."
Ikaruga,RDR2 is one the best video games ever made. Definitely go for that first.
Ikaruga,RDR2 any day of the week.
Ikaruga,"Play RDR2 first and then buy Cyberpunk when the new expansion drops. I love both games, but it sounds like CP2077: Phantom Liberty will be the definitive edition"
Ikaruga,"I would recommend both, but you need to play RDR2 if you haven't first"
Ikaruga,Red dead redemption 2 a million times over cyberpunk
Ikaruga,"RDR2, absolutely."
Ikaruga,"I think cyberpunk and the expansion are on sale right now. But I’d go for rdr2 first considering it will be more instant gratification then having to wait till December for the expansion on cyberpunk, which will have a ton of new content meant to make the experience way better."
Ikaruga,"Cyberpunk is poorly written, rdr2 is a masterclass"
Ikaruga,RDR2 by a mile
Ikaruga,"I played both games this year. I haven't finished Cyberpunk yet but it's pretty fun, I love everything about it except for some game breaking bugs and funny braindead AI. Both games are great but RDR2 is a triump; storytelling, characters, sound design, voice acting and impressive life-like world with a lot of details and hidden gems in it although gameplay is your standard Rockstar game, it's still an immersive game."
Ikaruga,"I would recommend that you never buy cyberpunk and if Red dead is your thing, go for it. (It’s not my thing. But seriously, don’t buy cyberpunk.)"
Ikaruga,Definitely Red Dead Redemption 2. Best game i have ever played since 2006
Ikaruga,"huge cyberpunk fan here, i'd probably buy it when phantom liberty comes out since they're overhauling everything. RDR2 however was a masterpiece when it came out. definitely grab it, especially if on sale"
Ikaruga,RDR2 will make you question if any game you ever played was good at all.
Ikaruga,"Fair warning. I also say RDR2, BUT you need to go into it realizing it IS intentionally slower paced. Take your time with it, really invest in the characters and just hang out in the world, exploring and such. However, that said, I absolutely LOVE RDR2. It’s my favorite of all time."
Ikaruga,Rdr2
Ikaruga,"Both are really good 

I really enjoyed RDR2 a lot but Cyberpunk has something that really made me love it. 

I don't know if it's the setting or the overall dystopian world but it's a really great experience now

Plus Phantom Liberty is coming in september I believe so it might be worth a try"
Ikaruga,"Both are on par and considered masterpieces of their own, CP story is more complex and fast paced while RDR2 is more of a slow burn kind of story. I think that CP is the superior game but I think you should buy both."
Ikaruga,"Imo RDR2 is superior in essentially every aspect, I would definitely try it out."
Ikaruga,Get both
Ikaruga,"Definitely RDR2, seriously it contains the best protagonist you’ll ever play."
Ikaruga,"Red dead is a must - cyberpunk is a should, so play RDR 2 first, then when the DLC is out pick up cyberpunk"
Ikaruga,RDR2. I played both but for me RDR2 is just better.
Ikaruga,"RDR2 barring it’s online is easily one of the best games ever made in my opinion. Same goes for RDR1, which can be played in either order. On top of that there’s undead nightmare as an added plus"
Ikaruga,"I love both. But if I had to choose, it would be RDR2"
Ikaruga,"Honestly both are really great games, you should pick based on what type of world you would like to dive into. Dystopian future, vs movie western."
Ikaruga,Rdr2 killed my parents. We’re happily married now.
Ikaruga,"RDR2 for sure!!!! I'm playing it again right now. Easily in my top 10 greatest games of all time. And with the amount of games I've played over 30+ years, that is really saying something."
Ikaruga,Honestly they are both amazing In their own rights. RDR2 is considered one of the best games of all time tho so it’s an easy pick
Ikaruga,"Obvious answer is rdr 2 first, but let me say this. No open world game will ever be the same after rdr2. Its miles ahead any game ive played to this day, technically and story wise."
Ikaruga,"Both games are amazing. You can't go wrong with either - great storyline, great side quests, you can just dig yourself in for hours and hours. I'd highly recommend both. But if I had to pick one, I'd say RDR2. It left a bigger impression on me after finishing it."
Ikaruga,"RDR2 is probably the better game from a technical standpoint, but I found the controls kind of kludgy to be honest.  I beat it once and have never felt the desire to replay it.

Cyberpunk on the other hand is the kind of game I can beat then immediately want to start a new character.  Yeah, it's undoubtably not as polished, but I just had more fun with it.  (Again, a big part of this probably just comes back to the controls, which were a lot smoother in Cyberpunk.)

Honestly...  You should just  get them BOTH!"
Ikaruga,Rdr2 is easily the greatest console game ever made
Ikaruga,"They’re very different games which is something to bare in mind. However, RDR2 is a much more polished product. I’d play that first and then pick up 2077/Phantom Liberty because they have basically said that the entire game is getting overhauled and polished with the next update/DLC in September. Both games will grip you emotionally as they’re very well written"
Ikaruga,I played through cyberpunk twice. I stopped playing RDR2 when I got bored of riding my horsey.
Ikaruga,Cyberpunk. Honestly RDR2 kind of bored me
Ikaruga,And I will play it. Thanks for the reply.
Ikaruga,Yeah what else is there to say? Although Cyberpunk is very enjoyable
Ikaruga,I would say portal is a triumph.
Ikaruga,"Sure, I guess then RDR2 it is. Thanks for the reply."
Ikaruga,I won't pass on either but I guess first I will go through RDR2. Thanks for the reply.
Ikaruga,I didn't feel the same. What is so unmissable about red dead for you?
Ikaruga,To be honest it really depends. Personally I felt Red dead was a little to realistic for me and Cyber punk was more actiony.
Ikaruga,">It will give you a thrill, make you feel like a badass, and then leave you in tears.

beautifully said."
Ikaruga,Yes.
Ikaruga,Same here it's hard to get into other games since I've played rdr2 I keep going back to it.
Ikaruga,"Yeah, I guess waiting for the new update and dlc is the best option as new things will be added along with overhauls. Thanks for the reply."
Ikaruga,What kind of depth does rdr2 have?
Ikaruga,"Yeah. I just saw the dlc as pre-order along with Cyberpunk, but I think it will not be a great idea to buy it as they are adding and overhauling some features of the game in the next update probably. I guess waiting atleast till the update will be the right choice. Thanks for the reply."
Ikaruga,I’ve just started the game is it best to wait for the DLC then and when does it drop ?
Ikaruga,Phantom Pain is Metal Gear Solid. Cyberpunk 2077's expansion is called Phantom Liberty.
Ikaruga,Do you know if ultimate version of RDR2 is worth it?
Ikaruga,Any other game similar to rdr2 in gameplay? I love the sort of chill vibes with the option of action.
Ikaruga,Careful it's CP2077
Ikaruga,"Just a minor note that the outfit issue was fixed with a transmog function, so now you can play dress up and not just worry about stats.  But if you want to see your own outfit you have to drive a motorcycle."
Ikaruga,Should I finish cyberpunk before the dlc?
Ikaruga,"Yeah same here, RDR2 was amazing but I was way more immersed in Cyberpunk's world than RDR2's one 

Though both are really great games and should be played imo"
Ikaruga,"Sorry to bother, but I would also like to ask which edition of RDR2 should I get. I will tell beforehand that I don't think I will be playing online version of the game."
Ikaruga,I think most people agree that RDR2’s story is great and the strongest part of the game besides the visuals.
Ikaruga,"Bruh. Who has the audacity to say RDR2 doesn’t have a good story?

It’s been widely, widely lauded as having one of the best stories in recent years"
Ikaruga,"Thanks. I think story is subjective so might really like RDR2 too as I am not a huge fan of futuristic world. Though I am not a huge fan of Cowboys either (mediaeval fan here), though I might like it if I play it. Thanks for replying, I might get RDR2 now and wait for the update and expansion of Cyberpunk."
Ikaruga,"I don't know about the story, but the best video game character is BT-7274. Period."
Ikaruga,"This is how I feel. Cyberpunk was faster paced and I got more immediate gratification. I actually still haven’t gotten very far in RDR2 just because it has been slower-paced, but that being said, it is an exceptionally well-designed game"
Ikaruga,"You’ve just described my exact experience. I really enjoyed RDR2 but we had just had our first baby when the it released - I just didn’t have the time and it fell by the wayside as a result, so I never finished it. Cyberpunk I managed to complete several times over on PS4 Pro and one more on PS5. Every single play through I’ve played completely differently to the last. It’s been immense. The sheer variety on offer with the story and the play styles means totally different experiences each time. While Red Dead is a beautiful and epic experience - it’s a fairly unilateral one. The only real variety coming from how many side missions or how much peripheral content you want to pursue. My wife played Cyberpunk more than I did - her sessions were vastly different to mine. I haven’t seen anything quite like it since the likes of Elder Scrolls."
Ikaruga,“HANK! DON’T ABBREVIATE CYBERPUNK LIKE THAT! HAAAAANK!”
Ikaruga,Not really. Where is the single player content?
Ikaruga,"Same is experience. RDR2 more polished and you interact with more things, and NPC has better reactions. But cyberpunk is just more fun to play.

My biggest issue with rockstar games is that on rails and very linear. That’s being said they still quality games and will buying the next Rockstar game when it comes out."
Ikaruga,You can always turn off aim assist for a better challenge in RDR2
Ikaruga,What do you mean by terrible gameplay in RDR2?
Ikaruga,"Yeah, just saw the amount of things they are adding in the update and expansion. Some of it is overhaul of current systems so I guess waiting for the update and the dlc is the best thing for now. Anyways, I would like to ask one more thing, should I buy RDR2 on Epic store or Steam because as far as I have heard, Epic store has a really bad mod support for games. And I guess there some fine mods for RDR2 so would like to get my hands on them. Thanks."
Ikaruga,"> game i *paid* for. So

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*"
Ikaruga,"I played the game about a year ago and only experienced like 5 bugs, none of them even being close to game breaking"
Ikaruga,I bought and played a month or so ago and experienced almost 0 bugs. I think one quest messed up and that was it. After the most recent patch it seems pretty good. Also looks amazing with the ray tracing.
Ikaruga,">the janky controls are super frustrating and honestly it’s pretty slow at times. I don’t need to watch long animations every time I pick something up or do anything. It’s more cowboy sim than game.  
>  
>Tried it 3 times and never make it past 10 hrs or so.

Not every game is made for you."
Ikaruga,you think cyberpunk is a fail because of first week youtube videos and headlines. mostly everyone that plays the game says it is on track to becoming a no man's sky type revive
Ikaruga,Cyberpunk absolutely does not have better writing…
Ikaruga,no reason to skip one of the greatest games of this generation
Ikaruga,"How is it overrated, there’s no game that has that level of detail, i can understand not enjoying the slow paced gameplay, but you can’t deny that no game has pushed the boundaries of open world like red dead in terms of immersion."
Ikaruga,sure buddy go play ludo
Ikaruga,You're getting hate but it's true. RD2 felt more like an interactive movie than a game.
Ikaruga,"For reference, I have played both and love both, I even lean towards rdr2, but I am recommending based on OP's interests, unlike most of you"

Ikaruga,I’ll be honest I thought RDR2 was a tedious piece of trash and nothing like the first game. Cyberpunk   Is more fun and you’ll want to play it more.
Ikaruga,"Cyberpunk is getting a big expansion in September, along with a huge update that overhauls the whole game pretty much. Definitely hit RDR first and then grab cyberpunk after the update sometime."
Ikaruga,Great story.  Great gameplay.  Great experience overall.
Ikaruga,"I think it has some serious flaws but most of those flaws are in line with the vision of the game rather than being oversights. Like all the animations and forced walk sections, or the controls not being very arcadey with no jump button. The main flaw that defies this rule is the absurdly on-the-rails quests, which are typical for Rockstar.

All of that being said, it was in many ways a masterwork. Unparalleled attention to detail. Felt great to explore and discover. Could sink absurd hours into it or just pick up and play, and either way is fun. I find myself coming back to it all the time and finding things I missed.

It was imo the first Open World to feature both breadth and depth in world design without being riddled with bugs. You can tell the crunch went into perfecting the details rather than throwing the game together.

Gameplay and story not revolutionary but consistently solid."
Ikaruga,It’s an absolute masterpiece.
Ikaruga,"I've played and beaten both, and I love both games. That being said RDR2 is a fucking masterpiece. I don't know any game I'd pick over rdr2 in a one on one."
Ikaruga,"It's probably the deepest and most fully realized open world ever crafted, filled with rich and compelling characters, emergent choices, and awesome things to discover. It's held up by many experts as one of the iconic examples of video games as art. But go off, chief. Contrarianism is all the rage."
Ikaruga,"It would be easier to list what components of RDR2 *do not* have depth:

Enemies - it's all pew pew guys across the board.

Mounts - it's all horses across the board.

As for narrative, gameplay, world building, world interaction, customization, side missions, character developments, npc interactions, etc. etc. etc., I could go on but I've given your clearly catty, insincere comment enough effort and time, maybe just become more interesting in the future and open up with a compelling point next time."
Ikaruga,September 26.
Ikaruga,Haha very true that was a Freudian slip!
Ikaruga,"If you can get it cheap then maybe but I don't think it's worth it, personally."
Ikaruga,Rdr1 is the only one I can think of
Ikaruga,GTA
Ikaruga,Death Stranding I suppose both tedious games but are top 3 for me
Ikaruga,Oh that’s good to know. And thanks for the correction
Ikaruga,No they plan to overhaul the ai and make other changes. (Better Skill tree for example)
Ikaruga,"In which case, the cheapest version. The ultimate edition just has online content iirc"
Ikaruga,"Is the story really good or are the characters just carrying everything? Playing rn and the story is kind of meh. Rockstar games never really had a great main story, but that is not necessary with all the fun.

Not saying I'm right, just how I am feeling right now."
Ikaruga,[deleted]
Ikaruga,"Many actually. And even as a huge fan myself, I understand that the pacing of that story is all over the place and many of my friends drop it after initial 2-3 snowy hours and I keep on trying to convince them."
Ikaruga,"When I was contemplating rdr2 I felt like you. I also was unsure about the horse riding mechanic, as I was used to GTA and using vehicles. And I was unsure I would enjoy the 1899 setting. But let me tell you, get this game! It’s so good. You will end up being fascinated with the world, including the horse riding."
Ikaruga,"I've tried to get into RDR2 multiple times, I really appreciate the quality and complexity of the game, but I just can't, because I find the entire cowboy setting to be boring and uninteresting."
Ikaruga,"The game was so good and complete at release, it didn’t need it."
Ikaruga,"There's a reason why they made auto aim the default in RDR2, because the combat is so clunky that it needs it"
Ikaruga,It’s a very boring gameplay that’s for sure.
Ikaruga,Mainly because the mission design and combat are so bad
Ikaruga,"I play on PS5, so I wouldn't know much about epic store vs steam. Maybe try asking on the Red Dead sub, they will probably give better answers than I could"
Ikaruga,You can mod pretty much everygame on steam just as well if not better than epic. Some games even have steam cumunity mods through the steam store such as l4d2. Really the only reason id choose epic over steam for anything is if epic is giving a game away for free and even them there are some cases where id still just rather buy it from steam.
Ikaruga,Good bot
Ikaruga,The freind i borrowed it from said the same thing so i guess it varied from person to person. My experience was a mess. Nothing game breaking in the sense that i couldn't progress but a lot of religing becouse i got stuck in terminals and uis. Also had this one where jackie always had his gun out no matter what animtion he was doing or where he was. Even had it on that mission where we coukdnt bring our guns. Nothing could have been done to fix that one just had to accept that that was jakie now for that playthrough
Ikaruga,"Im with this guy, never had any game breaking bugs in this game from day 1. Playing PC with a good gpu over on my end tho. If youve got a 30 series gpu or newer cyberpunk runs literally fine"
Ikaruga,Yeah thats one thing i can personally attest to it looks really good. Also it supports dlss 3 fram generation so it runs really smooth a 4000 series card.
Ikaruga,"This is a stupid fucking reply

Nowhere did they say that. They're allowed to criticise the controls of a game when someone asks for opinions on that game. Opinions from both sides are important when deciding whether to buy something or not."
Ikaruga,Never said it was.
Ikaruga,It's widely agreed the controls and combat are super clunky.
Ikaruga,"Opinions are opinions my dude, both games had amazing writing but I felt more connected to Cyberpunk."
Ikaruga,Guess the opinions are divided. I didn't like rdr2's writing very much. What was so great about it then?
Ikaruga,I agree about the level of detail. For sure it's impressive in that aspect. It's just soooo fucking slooow man. I almost didn't finish that game considering how tedious it was. I'm sorry.
Ikaruga,Ok
Ikaruga,"Tedious as f... imo. I almost didn't finish it, but the story got me through. Gameplay was the worst!"
Ikaruga,"Weird, I was raised by fast paced shooters and such and absolutely adored rdr2 despite its slower nature."
Ikaruga,"Want to cook some food? 10 minute animation per piece cooked. Want to loot something? 10 minute animation of you picking the body up. Want to skin an animal? 45 minute animation. Oh, and btw, you need hundreds of pelts if you want to do side content. It is the most ridiculous shit.

Everyone kept telling me I needed to get to chapter 2 to really get a feel for the game. I made it past chapter 2 and I still hate the game. Only now I'm past my refund window and hate it even more now.

Every mission is you riding with some member of your crew on horseback for 45 minutes while you get gigantic exposition dumps. RDR2 is the game you get when you distill the WORST parts of the GTA franchise down into a cowboy game.

This was the first game that was universally praised, in a genre I love, that I hated to it's core. It has me questioning whether or not i should even bother buying the last of us on PC."
Ikaruga,Where are details on the huge update? Can’t seem to find any but very interested
Ikaruga,Still playing cyberpunk on a console like ps5 is like playing in a ghost town. If OP has a decent rig he should definitely hit cyberpunk in September.
Ikaruga,"Wasn't this supposed to come out this month? I am very excited about the DLC, but I'll believe the release date once I've downloaded it."
Ikaruga,"Will they completely drop their sad excuse for an armor system, their sad excuse for a weapon system, and their sad excuse for a perk system? Oh wait… that’s like every system in the damn game. Would be silly to ask for that.

Edit: holy shit it looks like they are!"
Ikaruga,"I thought it was very visually impressive and well acted. Also the soundtrack fucking slaps. I love the soundtrack. It also usually managed to capture the intended vibe very well. But it wasn't very thought-provoking. And some of the side content just completely misses the mark. 

Cyberpunk is a lot less polished and pleasant. But some of the sidequests could have carried entire high-quality indiegames."
Ikaruga,"Trailing missions, long ass point a to point b travel, goofy ah shooting, extremely linear missions, breaking the games economy with that stage coach robbery mission. Can’t deny the flaws."
Ikaruga,Did not know a simple question was a clearly catty insincere comment....
Ikaruga,"Lol what a pathetically insecure reply. RDR2 has absolutely zero depth when it comes to gameplay, mission structure, level design, or npc interactions. It’s all shallow set dressing for a pretty decent story that would’ve worked better as a TV series. As an actual videogame, it’s average at best."
Ikaruga,"> I've given your clearly catty, insincere comment enough effort and time, maybe just become more interesting in the future and open up with a compelling point next time.

You’re right - how dare he ask a simple question about your favourite game?! The audacity of /u/ihave0idea0 knows no limits! 

Personally I find RDR2 wholly unappealing to me, mostly because what I’ve seen of the combat mechanics seems quite repetitive and more importantly not skill-based.  
But I also don’t like the Elder Scrolls series or Cyberpunk for the same reason, so this thread just isn’t for me."
Ikaruga,"Yeah, been through that. And online doesn't do it for me"
Ikaruga,I actually have that. Might give it a try
Ikaruga,Oh I’ll wait then damn okay thanks.
Ikaruga,Thank you very much.
Ikaruga,"It’s definitely more character driven than plot driven. It might take a while for the story to get going, but when it does, it’s really some of the best dramatic writing I’ve ever seen in anything. It’s worth sticking with for sure."
Ikaruga,"… that’s what a story is, a journey of characters through an arc. The plot of 99% of stories is the same basic shit."
Ikaruga,"Fair, I can’t seem to get into Witcher 3, despite being a huge fan of the lore and gameplay.

It just… feels so huge and cumbersome"
Ikaruga,Yeah the story feels very disjointed. You do like 5 completely unrelated main story missions and then eventually come across another mission that advances the story. How’s that a great story? I get that people like those unrelated main missions since they like long games and are willing to tolerate a somewhat disjointed story if it means a longer game. But you can’t tell me that’s a good story. A good story must have a good flow.
Ikaruga,Rdr2 is easily top 5 of last gen
Ikaruga,"Yeah it's not even gameplay.
Just high quality movie"
Ikaruga,Tried that but didn't get any answer. Other modding subreddits had no idea either. I guess I will try asking there again. Thank you very much.
Ikaruga,"Actually had a coupon on epic store, so wouldn't want it to go to waste. I have some other the list but would live to know if epic store version can be modded. The RDR2 subreddit seems kinda dead with most of the posts with no replies so I think I might not get one there either."
Ikaruga,Best bot
Ikaruga,">This is a stupid fucking reply

Exactly my thoughts lol.

I absolutely loved RDR2 but I can totally see how it can be boring for some people. In fact, I've seen plenty of comments on various subs saying exactly that, so I think it's important thing to highlight for OP."
Ikaruga,"It was cool at first but then I just got tired of it quick. I also work 50hrs a week with like 1 hour commute one way so I just don’t have time for slow games anymore. 
That being said getting off a horse just to pick something up every time is just an awful game play design."
Ikaruga,What a debby downer you are. Pessimistic much? Lol
Ikaruga,Valid
Ikaruga,"[Check it](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/147domj/everything_new_with_phantom_liberty_and_patch_17/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)

I’m pretty excited"
Ikaruga,It says September 26th on steam. Even if you don't get the DLC you still get access to the massive overhaul btw.
Ikaruga,I think the side content is amazing. Maybe some things could be better but it is very good
Ikaruga,"Yeah I get that but thought provoking is not what I expect from Rockstar, or any game outside of select RPGs.

It’s more like a great execution of a tried and true formula. If I wanted a thought provoking Western, I’d reread Blood Meridian, not play an open world game."
Ikaruga,There’s nothing thought provoking about Cyperpunk either
Ikaruga,They’re not flaws…  They’re features!
Ikaruga,Yeah rockstar hasn't improved it's gameplay since GTA San Andreas. It's a shame because visually and story wise the games are brilliant
Ikaruga,"It's not a simple question, it's probably the most highly praised game of the last decade, pretending that you know nothing about it whatsoever and have decided to randomly come to me to learn more about it is naive and stupid at best."
Ikaruga,"And this is the kind of dumbass mentality that went behind asking 'hurr, what kind of depth rdr2 got?'"
Ikaruga,"The OP asked which game should he play, not your emotional personal take that doesn’t help at all and literally NO ONE cares about"
Ikaruga,I hear you. Just the most similar gameplay I could think of. Basically the same game at a different time period with different technology.
Ikaruga,"Story wise, propably. Gameplay, definetly not."
Ikaruga,I dont see why not you wouldnt be able too. Modding alters your local files on your system so i feel like whichever store front you bought it from wouldnt matter. All the games ive ever modded were on steam but i never had to actually interact with steam to do it so i feel like the same processes would have worked even if i bought them from epic.
Ikaruga,"Fair enough, that horse thing is true"
Ikaruga,"Everyone I know loves this game. So I never criticize it around them, because I would feel like a debbie downer. It was just exciting to finally see someone else hate it."
Ikaruga,Everything he said is valid and he’s entitled to his opinion. That isn’t pessimism
Ikaruga,"The shredder of panda guy I’m replying to blocked  me, then reported me to Reddit for some kinda wellness check?? People are so weird.. wtf"
Ikaruga,"Thank you. 

Man I am hype now."
Ikaruga,I'm happy for you. That I didn't feel the same doesn't mean I want to take that away from you
Ikaruga,"I don't think thought provoking was something they were not trying to do. The story of the main characters in what is essentially a cult was compelling but just not for that long. 

Also looking at cyberpunk again. I think there are plenty of moments there that could be labeled thought provoking. 

Maybe I just wanted the wrong things from the game."
Ikaruga,"No? What about Joshua's quest line? Rivers quest line? The quests with the mayor and his wife? V's story, the different endings. Even the quest with the vending machine ends up asking some interesting questions."
Ikaruga,Let’s hope for gta 6 I personally didn’t like rdr2 as much as other people did for personal reasons but I still thought it was a fantastic game
Ikaruga,"Damn, you even double-downed on it.

People ARE allowed to not know everything about RDR2, man.

You clearly spend a lot of time thinking about your favourite video games - that’s fine, but you should realise that other people may have other interests and may actually not know much about it, if at all.

As I said I personally find the gameplay uninteresting (not sure how you can think it has a lot of depth, tbh) - and a game without good gameplay is just a bad game to me. Therefore I have little interest in Rockstar games in general, because their gameplay is usually super casual-oriented.

As for the rest of you description of the depth of the game, you used a bunch of buzz-words but didn’t actually explaining anything to the guy.

Good graphics, good story, world building, character development and voice acting are great, but if that’s all there is to it, I’d rather watch a movie or read a book tbh. Gameplay is where games are at for me, and a lot of people in general."
Ikaruga,"Did you mean to reply to someone else?

How am I the emotional one for replying to someone having a complete meltdown at the mère idea that someone didn’t know the alleged qualities of RDR2?

I explained why I thought that neither games thought of by OP were particularly good in my opinion. That’s very relevant to the discussion.

What’s the point of your needlessly aggressive comment that no one asked for and no one cares about, to use your own words?"
Ikaruga,Exactly. However I think my emotional investment was larger in rdr2. But time period doesn't really matter.
Ikaruga,"Thanks for the reply. Just wanted to make sure. Actually, I heard and experienced issues with modding, especially with Bethesda games in Epic Games Store. And in general have heard people saying that Epic store is pretty bad if someone wants to play with mods. Modding for me is one of the main and most fun things (especially in games like Skyrim) so sometimes no excess to mods can be a huge deal breaker for me."
Ikaruga,"""10 minute animation. 45 minute animation"". Yeah sure  that's real valid isn't it lol. Someone being overly negative and blowing something out of proportion is considered to be pessimistic to me. I never said he was wrong and couldn't have an opinion. I just called him a debby downer. I'm entitled to my opinion as well right?"
Ikaruga,"Hey, what didn’t you like about the side content? I guess hunting is kinda barebones"
Ikaruga,"Rivers quest was so boring. Go here, fetch this. Fetch that. Search the nephews room for clues. Snooze fest. It was nothing I haven’t seen before a million times. Most of the side quests were boring as hell. There were some cool moments, but thought provoking? Nah."
Ikaruga,"Don't care, didn't read; get more interesting and stop leaning on sarcasm as a crutch for your lack of personality."
Ikaruga,Continue with your non contributions. Op asked which game and here you are just wasting thread space
Ikaruga,If you want to rant about how terrible RDR2 is make your own post
Ikaruga,"Your making comments on someone’s character over a game, if anything you’re a Debby downer"
Ikaruga,"Some of the sidequests were kinda stupid and unsatisfying. The one that stuck in my mind the most was the one where you encounter that woman who takes advantage of two guys with disabilities and the ark of the story is that the guys don't want to be with her because she's an absolutely horrible, abusive human being. Then when you find them they realise that they're still gonna go with her. 

Like what's the point? I had no input, the ark of the characters was to learn to put up with an abuser and it took like 20 minutes. 

&#x200B;

Not to say that I encountered no good sidequests. The one where you help a woman learn to live in the forest was lovely. But the game to me was littered with moments that ended in an unsatisfying anticlimax."
Ikaruga,"Very interesting. What did you think of >!
Jackies funeral? !<"
Ikaruga,"That comes from the guy that screeched and had a complete meltdown when someone else dared ask which kind of depth RDR2 had, because how dare he not know your favourite video game.

There is 0 irony in my last comment, btw! Not that I would expect you to understand irony…

Lmfao, reddit basement-dweller moment."
Ikaruga,"What’s YOUR contribution, lad? What’s your purpose? Why are you commenting?

As I said above, I explained why I thought neither of the games were particularly good in my opinion. That’s highly relèvent on a sub where people ask whether they should buy specific games.

My comment is on topic. Yours aren’t and are just useless attacks with 0 contribution on the actual subject. Are you perhaps an alt of the other guy? That’s the o my way this would make sense, tbh. You’re weird"
Ikaruga,"Ranting? For a whole 2 lines? Do you even know what a rant is? Open a dictionary ffs

The guy above had a meltdown when someone asked a simple question, I pointed out to him that no everyone necessarily liked every game or knew everything about every game.

That’s highly relevant to the conversation.

Once again, what is YOUR contribution here, apart from attacking me for no reason?"
Ikaruga,You're making comments about my character over a reddit post. A bit hypocritical.
Ikaruga,"Well, I didn't realize they had disabilities. Maybe I'm just stupid. I'm guessing your talking about the one where you had to keep punching and kicking those guys to prove which one was stronger? 

I saw it as funny, and I never saw them go back to her, I don't think I ever saw them after their final mission.  


Maybe I just didn't find them or I'm stupid. Oh well, I enjoyed those missions, and yeah that one with charlotte (woman in forest) was great."
Ikaruga,Getting his bike was the best part
Ikaruga,"No, you were in fact, weird because no one cares what you don’t like. I was genuinely interested in seeing how much people loved one game over the other but here you are."
Ikaruga,I already gave my contribution
Ikaruga,"My contribution was that I love both games but I feel like RDR two gets the one here because not only is it one of the greatest games of all time, but the story is pretty impactful"
Ikaruga,My context might seem illiterate because I am using voice to text
Ikaruga,"I think we're talking about another quest.  I googled it, it's called ""the smell of grease paint""."
Ikaruga,"Intruiging. I absolutely love that quest for how real it feels. 
>! How it takes the time to mourn and speak to the people that this affected. Presenting a death so realistically gave so much validity to the rest of the world. It made me remember times I've lost people. 
Death in video games is never presented like this. !<"
Ikaruga,"That sounds like a you issue, tbh

- Some people love one game more than the other

- some people prefer the other one

- some people like neither of them

These are all valid opinions on the exact same subject. I’m in the third camp, for reasons that I explained. I would therefore recommend OP to buy neither of these games if the reasons I gave resonate with him.

It’s hilarious that you don’t see that my comment is very much on topic for this thread - logic isn’t your forte, huh"
Ikaruga,"Clearly not in this chain of comment, which is why I’m asking you what you’re even doing here."
Ikaruga,"Fair enough! That’s understandable.

My contribution was that I didn’t like either of them for the reason stated above (gameplay isn’t interesting or skill-based enough, and that’s what matters most in games in my opinion), and therefore wouldn’t recommend either of them.

Don’t you see how my opinion is just as valid as yours? Again, why are you commenting here?"
Terraria,"While I cannot recommend the game enough, I personally don't enjoy playing the game with a controller. I just can't play it well without mouse and keyboard.  So take that for what it is."
Terraria,Switch is the way to go on this one. Terraria on a phone doesn’t really work too well from my experience.
Terraria,Thanks!
Inscryption,"Well that depends on what you want to play 

Inscryption is much more slow paced strategy wise, the story mode is cool and got me to play through it twice and then the challange mode is insanely fun afterwards 

Cuphead is high octane so for me it would be on the complete other side of the spectrum 

Depending on how good you are in either will determine if you will get a lot of play time but also if you feel like you get your money's worth"
Chained Echoes,Check out Yakuza: Like a Dragon
Chained Echoes,Octopath traveler 1 and 2 definitely
Chained Echoes,Have you played DOS2? Probably my favorite turn-based game that I’ve ever played.
Chained Echoes,"Chrono Trigger quite good from what I've heard. Only had time to play the first 2~ hours but it was fun.

Bug Fables is also probably worth a look. It's turn based with some active elements, similar to early Paper Mario gameplay but actually difficult. I really enjoyed it."
Chained Echoes,"**The Legend of Heroes: Trails of Cold Steel**. Honestly the best JRPG series I've ever played and I'm a huge fan of turn based JRPGs. The world building is absolutely stellar, best I've ever seen anywhere."
Chained Echoes,Midnight suns is turn based but with a card deck.
Chained Echoes,Trails series by Falcom and Yakuza Like a Dragon
Chained Echoes,Yakuza: Like A Dragon
Chained Echoes,"South Park: The Stick of Truth. Probably the only turn based combat game i've played and loved it. Have not watched a single episode of south park before playing, but became a fan after finishing. Really fun game"
Chained Echoes,"Some of my favorite turn-based games are:

Across the Obelisk (probably the most new player friendly)

Inscryption

For the King

Slay the Spire

Stolen Realm"
Chained Echoes,"Tactics Ogre, Octopath traveler 1 and 2"
Chained Echoes,"How is DQ11 anyway, recently finished the FF Series and love the turn based ones.

As for a recommendation, Yakuza: Like a Dragon. You don't necessarily need to play the previous ones as this one introduces a new protagonist and is a new era."
Chained Echoes,Octopath 2!!
Chained Echoes,"If you don't mind something more on side of strategies (tactical/strategic RPGs), try Wasteland 3."
Chained Echoes,"Since you only mentioned Persona 5, have you played the other two persona games available on modern systems? If not, highly recommend. Persona 4 Golden and Persona 3 Portable would be to your liking I'd imagine."
Chained Echoes,"I never played original ff7, but the remake really made me love the game as a whole. I'm currently playing it on my second playthru on hard mode.
Shin Megami Tensei series is a good choice if u liked P5, but sadly the most recent game is only on sw"
Chained Echoes,"Hey, how did you like Chained Echoes? Any thoughts on whether it had be a good first game for a total RPG beginner?"
Chained Echoes,"I have that in my backlog, I’ve played some other Yakuza games but I haven’t given that one a try yet."
Chained Echoes,"I have, I agree that it’s a great game!"
Chained Echoes,"I played a little over an hour of that, but then my power went out and I realized I hadn’t saved at all since I started, so my progress was gone. I plan on going back to it though, it didn’t grab my attention immediately, but I keep seeing people really praising it."
Chained Echoes,"I’ve played that, I really liked it! Not many other games have actually made me laugh when I’m just sitting by myself playing it."
Chained Echoes,"Another vote for Slay the Spire. I got burnt out on turn based games in the early 2000s (after tons of PS1 and PS2 RPGs), but StS brought me back."
Chained Echoes,"I’m really enjoying it so far, I’m about 50 hours in and it’s still holding my attention."
Chained Echoes,The first two acts were great but act 3 (post game) is boring unless you enjoy grinding.
Chained Echoes,It’s fun and scratches that old school turn based RPG itch. Pretty easy if you don’t use the difficulty modifiers. Long game with an interesting enough light hearted story. Didn’t expect to put about 100 or so hours in but I’d keep coming back to it.
Chained Echoes,I played a bit of the demo and it’s definitely one I’m looking forward to playing. Just not sure if I want to spend $60 on it quite yet. I love the art style though!
Chained Echoes,"I haven’t, I played an couple hours of Persona 4 Golden on Vita years ago and didn’t really like it, but since I liked 5 so much I should give it another shot. 

I’ve heard Persona 3 is pretty grindy and tedious, is that true?"
Chained Echoes,"Like a Dragon is one of the funniest games I've ever played. Over the top story, hilarious combat (literally beating enemies with vibrators), give it a try!"
Chained Echoes,"It does take a bit to get into sadly. The entire series consists of 9 games (with more on the way), and they are all really long. I do recommend sticking with it."
Chained Echoes,"Check out across the obelisk if you haven’t! It’s basically StS if it were 4v4 instead of 1vX.

A lot of really cool class synergy—16 total characters, 4 different character subclasses for each role of Warrior, Rogue, Mage, and Support. 

50pt permanent perk trees for every character as well as individual in-run talent trees for each character. Can mix and match however you want to create custom group comps with unique playstyles."
Chained Echoes,"A few of my other all-time favorites, most are considered retro now: Super Mario RPG, FF7, FF8, FF9, FF10, Chrono Cross, Earthbound, Paper Mario Series."
Chained Echoes,I plan on Act 3 being my “mindless gaming while listening to a podcast” game
Chained Echoes,"Just wait for a sale then forsure, the art style is amazing. Tbh, I paid full price and don’t regret it. I’ve racked up 75 hrs so far and haven’t even seen the last 3 stories or done any post game dungeons etc. I still have a lot to do. I genuinely was not big into turn based combat until I started this game last week, I truly fell in love. Now I’m playing persona 5, and have a long backlog of games I wanna try."
Chained Echoes,"I would say to give P4G another shot if you realised you like JRPGs now, yeah.

I mean, you do have to grind to a certain extent but I wouldn't call it tedious since it's pretty similar to P4 and P5 and I didn't think those were tedious. If you play P4G and enjoy it, you'll likely enjoy P3P. It also has far and away the best writing/characters out of the 3 modern personas. The other two don't even come close, it's a masterclass.

One recommendation, if you do play P3P, play as the male character. You can choose between male or female, but the female character playthrough is aesthetically/thematically distant from what P3's original story is meant to be, so play the male story first."
Chained Echoes,Wow sounds cool. I’m a console gamer but will keep an eye out for this one.
Chained Echoes,"I’d pay full price if my backlog wasn’t already so full lol I can’t justify spending $60 on a game when I’ve got like 10 games I haven’t even touched. 

I definitely plan on playing and getting the platinum at some point, it seems like exactly the kind of game I like. 

Person 5 Royal was amazing, I played it during the Covid lockdown and I think I put in like 100 hours in a week lol"
Subnautica,"Even me as a non thalassophobic got scared of the vast unknown. Only you can decide but it's a fantastic game that might help you fight the fear.

Oh and please... use paragraphs and punctuation."
Subnautica,"as a guy who hated the hype of subnautica, received it as a present, and played it only out of an emotional obligation

it was fucking amazing. first game I ever platinumed. embrace the fear."
Subnautica,"Subnautica is an incredible game but only you know how severe your thalassaphobia is and whether you can overcome it or not.

I don't have thalassaphobia and even I felt uncomfortable in some of the deeper and more open areas of Subnautica."
Subnautica,[deleted]
Subnautica,"I love Subnautica, but if you have thalassophobia then you're going to find it absolutely terrifying.  It can be an intense game at times even for people without Thalassophobia."
Subnautica,Skywalker saga isnt worth it unless its down to 5-10$
Subnautica,"I’ve wanted it for a fair while and finally but the bullet a few months back. The game was incredible and the whole gear factor of the unknown is real, but once you start to explore certain areas and become familiar with your surroundings it actually becomes pretty average in terms of fear you actually start to become comfortable diving really deep into the dark. I find using the scanner on the smaller sun vehicle you get helps with mapping out the area and spotting larger animals faster than you can visually see which also makes it less scary"
Subnautica,"subnautica is awesome, i highly reccomend. its got some frights, but it might even help with the talassophobia through exposure therapy.

edit: saw your comment, so sad you cant enjoy the amazing experience that is this game. hope you enjoy skywalker saga!"
Subnautica,Lmao let them type how they want to type...
Subnautica,Yeah i tried and sincerily i cant play it at least nintendo gave me a refund so im buying skywalker saga :D
Subnautica,Bro if go 50 meters away for the start i alr start to shit myself lol
Subnautica,Its 11 dollars
Subnautica,"They can type how they want to type, but the way their paragraph is written makes it significantly harder for me to read, which makes it harder for me to help them."
Subnautica,Then it might be worth it super short levels jumping through story skips a lot small open world with a lot of bricks to collect
Subnautica,I bough subnautica ppl be calling it a masterpiece so i wanna give it a shot
Subnautica,And its a bit cheaper than skywalker saga
Subnautica,Good luck!
Katana Zero,"It’s amazing

Engaging story and satisfying gameplay

Definitely worth $15"
Katana Zero,"ive heard people say that it has a good story, but that is nowhere NEAR justifying the story here. this is probably one of my favorite stories, if not my most favorite story, of every video ive ever played.  


When people make reviews, they talk about the gameplay, and while the gameplay is definitely good, its not what i remember most. buy it. and for gods sake, go in blind."
Katana Zero,Yes.
Katana Zero,About how many hours of gameplay from start to finish?
Katana Zero,"I can’t remember exactly

It’s not the longest game but it’s definitely quality over quantity

Maybe 8 hours or so"
Katana Zero,about 4 and a half hours.
Katana Zero,And there’s a free dlc on the way which is half the size of the main game
Tunic,"I have only played Ori and the blind forest, not the second one. But I also have played Tunic and as much as I liked Ori, my vote is for Tunic.

Ori is such a beautiful game, it rekindled my love of platformers. It's very well done, the controls are smooth, it's a soothing, yet emotional story, but for me it doesn't reinvent the genre. It's great at what it does, but it doesn't try anything new. Which is fine, but I like games that can give me a well executed innovative idea. 

Which brings us to Tunic. Now I'm not omniscient and can't fact check this (or rather won't take the time, sorry), but Tunic does something so smart and new (for me at least it's new) with it's manual mechanic, that it will forever be etched in my mind as one of the best Indi game I've played. The exploration is fun, the level design is very interesting. The combat is tight and enjoyable. But the secrets are what made this game for me. The ingenuity behind this games and it's inner workings are simply remarkable. By the end of the game, I was blown away by all the little things. I also like the way they did the story telling. The game definitely makes you feel like a genius whenever you figure something out. If you end up trying it, I recommend staying the hell away from any spoilers of any kind. 

Enjoy your time with your choice.

Cheers"
Tunic,"I’ve played both, and i prefer Ori"
Tunic,"I haven’t played Tunic but my friends have praised it immensely. Its on my backlog to get to eventually.

I randomly picked up Ori and the Blind Forest a few years back. It was the perfect mix of *everything* I wanted in a game. It requires some skill for platforming (I typically do not enjoy platformers), amazing soundtrack, beautiful art, fantastic story, and everything rolled together for an amazing experience.

The sequel, Ori and the Will of the Wisps, is a direct sequel and a strict improvement. Streamlined some of the (mild) wonky combat, remixed and improved the platforming, even more awesome art and music.

Highly recommend Ori, can’t speak on Tunic but I have it on my backlog so take that as you will."
Tunic,"I haven’t played Tunic, so I cannot speak to that game, but the Ori games are great. 

Have you played Ori and the Blind Forest?  If not, I would do that one next (while you wait for Ori and the Will if the Wisps to go on sale, which it did for around 67% off 11 times in 2022). You can currently get it on Game Billet for $4. 

https://www.gamebillet.com/ori-and-the-blind-forest-definitive-edition-z?affiliate=1c8adfeb-78f3-4d89-9a91-5b697ec73e37"
Tunic,"I have only played ori and it’s sequel, but aside from the same genre it isn’t a lot like hollow knight. Ori is much more environment based, most of the enemies are apart of the environment, not just in it, the combat is a lot less complex, but the game is absolutely gorgeous."
Tunic,Ori is the better game imo. Also play the first if you haven't.
Tunic,"Tunic, but I also suggest you check out Death’s Door. I feel like Tunic, Hollow Knight and Death’s Door have some similar vibes."
Tunic,Both are available in xbox game pass :)
Tunic,Ive played both id reccomend saving your money
Tunic,"Thank you so much for responding, that is incredibly helpful! I heard a bit about the manual in Tunic and  thought it sounded very clever! I love the art styles of both, but Tunic’s near lack of any English definitely intrigues me"
Tunic,"I played a bit of Blind Forest a couple of years ago, and my taste in games was much more different than now (my favorite games at the time were Fortnite and Apex Legends💀). I feel that I appreciate Souls-likes and Metroidvanias, especially indies much more now. I would finish Blind Forest now, but I no longer have Xbox Game Pass, nor really play on my Xbox anymore"
Inside,"It has great spooky atmosphere but the puzzles are super boring. It's the experience that counts though, so if you feel like it, buy the game."
Inside,"I feel like you can get it for less in some sales, I really liked this game"
Inside,"I really digged it, it depends on you. You probably wont touch it after playing it once but its very good imo"
To the Moon,"I've played a bit of Coral Island, Sun Haven, and Roots of Pacha. I think one deciding factor might be how willing you are to deal with unfinished-ness. Of the three, only Sun Haven is fully released. Now, I will say that you're right - Coral Island is a really close match for stardew, probably the closest of the three, so if you don't mind getting into it while it's unfinished (and when I played, a few updates ago, it was VERY unfinished, mechanics unavailable, placeholder text in quest dialog, etc) then it might be what you want. I'm not sure what state Roots of Pacha is in now that it's early access, since I haven't played since beta, but it also scratches the stardew itch in its own way. Also enjoyed it, but got distracted before I got to the end of content and so I can't say how finished it is after the first few weeks in game.

Sun Haven, however, I've played a good 30 hours in. Not done yet, of course. To me it's the fantasy Stardew that I always hoped Rune factory would be (but it wasn't). It does have combat in more areas but I find it easier than stardew, not least because I can almost always outrun something I don't want to fight. The farming is just as in depth as stardew and the crafting is far more complex.

In the end, the one of the three I'd recommend unreservedly is Sun Haven, but if you're interested in seeing what the other two are like in early stages, then they're absolutely fun and interesting games."
To the Moon,"You can rule out Roots of Pacha if you want combat. It's fun though and is similar to Stardew with the prehistoric take. It's not Early Access; it's a full release game but will have content updates, so there's that. It has full multiplayer. I think it's less stressful than Stardew in that I don't feel like I need to get everything done in one day or maybe I just changed my view on how to play. 🤔

Coral Island is pretty much Stardew but very unfinished. I would wait on that one.

Graveyard Keeper was suggested and that's a good one too. It's VERY grindy, but I enjoyed the dark humor in it.

Haven't played Kynseed or Sun Haven so no insight to provide on those."
Her Story,"If you've already tried it, and didn't like it, then why buy it? I mean I can sit here and tell you why I love the story so much until I'm blue in the face, but if you don't like it, then don't buy it. Everyone says Elden Ring is a great game, but I'm not going to buy it because I don't like souls-like games. You don't like it, don't buy it. If you want to see the story, watch someone play it."
Her Story,"So you don't like cowboy things, you tried the game and couldn't get past the opening act, you find the online boring...

But you want to try it again?

I loved the game (once that snow part was over) but had the end ruined by this sub, but you probably won't like it still"
Her Story,"No? You've already tried it and didn't enjoy it. Why would you spend more money on a game you already know you don't like?  
There are plenty of things in the world that a lot of people like, but that doesn't mean you have to try and like them too"
Her Story,"I'm surprised if you like the last of us, you couldn't get into rdr2. Arthur is one of the greatest protagonists of all time and his story is incredible. His character arc is all time. 

Yes it's slow, but just play it slow, let it be a movie as much as a game, have all the conversations, explore the whole world."
Her Story,"Its not an amazing game for you, its primary goal is wild west gta cowboy roleplay.

You are not missing out if you dont play a game you obviously didnt enjoy. Especially since the game fundamentally doesn't ever change.

I personally found it to be one of the most boring generic open world games with a bland western story and actively regret both paying for it and finishing it because of the same narrative pushed by my console only friends. 

Sometimes a game just isnt for you and thats fine. You can leave it in your trashbin and someone else might think its their game of the year."
Her Story,"The prologue is widely panned as by far the worst part of the game, I hated it as well. Judging rdr2 based on the intro is like judging an orange for the flavour of its skin."
Her Story,"If you already tried and didn't like it, why bother?
Nothing changed about the story mode, it's the same. Only thing that could have changed is you. So only you can tell if you will like it or not, but only after trying it again. As example I had numerous games I didn't like back in a day, but I revisited them after years and fell in love with them, and vice versa."
Her Story,"It really doesn’t sound like you’re going to enjoy it.
1. You haven’t enjoyed rockstar historically
2. The snowy bit of the game sets the pace for much of the rest of it. It’s quite a slow burn, cinematic game, and it’s very character driven. Your top five games are all very action driven. The Last of Us has strong characters but its action carries it forward at all times.
3. You’re not bought into the game thematically - you don’t like cowboys.

I think everyone has at least one game that they just can’t get into despite it being universally loved. For me that game is Spider-Man. I find it really boring and hate how the same superhero music plays every time you leave the ground. Everyone else loves it, and that’s fine, but I know it’s not for me."
Her Story,"I think RDR2 is incredible. Its a full experience, its immersive. I don't consider it slow because there's always something I could be doing. Theres the main story, theres any number of side stories, you can go hunting or fishing or do bounties or whatever else. I find going from one place to another on horseback relaxing. Along the way you can run into some random encounter whether its an NPC being mugged or just needs help getting from one place to another.  There also is fast travel if you don't enjoy the horseback riding. I also consider Arthur one of the best protags in gaming period."
Her Story,"If you didn't like it, it's not for you. Don't torture yourself by spending money on it when the game is exactly the same. It's the best game ever made imo but I know it's not for everyone."
Her Story,"This sounds like you have same problem with this game as i have with FFXIV. I love MMORPG games but just cant get into liking FFXIV, altough many people calls it best of that genre. You dont have to like games that other people does."
Her Story,"Look, it's a beloved game with a huge cult following. That being said, it's certainly not for everyone, myself included. I've tried more times than I can count to start this game and I always get mired down in the awful slow creeping initial progression. I'm also just not that enamored with Western cowboy games though I do enjoy the movies. It's kind of paradoxical. Anyway, I finally gave up and just have no desire to ever play it again. If you have tried and yet didn't like it...don't try to force yourself to like it simply because others did. Find something that grabs you from the start."
Her Story,No. If you didn’t like the intro you won’t like the rest. The gameplay is just as slow and plodding and the combat just as sluggish all the way through.
Her Story,"Imma be honest, RDR2 is my favourite open world game, that being said, if you're bored of the beginning portions of the game and aren't getting it for the story, you should just skip altogether. The game is essentially 3 things: Horse riding, gunfights, cutscenes, rinse and repeat. There are no bosses, puzzles, etc. There are plenty of side content but they are essentially just a variations of the 3 things I mentioned."
Her Story,"I kind of get where you’re coming from, I’m quite picky with games and it didn’t massively appeal to me the first time I tried it. I went back for another go after reading good reviews and I’m so glad I did as I would have missed out on one of my favourite video game experiences otherwise. 
It’s definitely worth it - this is AAA gaming at the very top of its game. It may not be the exact genre you enjoy but I personally think it transcends its genre to be a classic that anyone can appreciate. Your mileage may vary ofc."
Her Story,"If you can’t be emotionally invested in your main character skip it, him getting sick and watching him get worse and worse until he vents in front of the sister, was some really sad depressing stuff, and it made me feel closer to Arthur. If you don’t feel something like that, skip it"
Her Story,"It’s a great game, but it’s not for everyone. I actually had a rough go of it when I first tried it as I was in a time of my life where I was too busy for the commitment RDR2 wanted. I got it day 1 because I loved the first then hardly played. Wasn’t until Covid that I had a ton of time and was suddenly engrossed in it, but that wasn’t the game getting better, it was a change in my life. If you already tried it once and didn’t like it and are in the same frame of mind as last time, you probably still won’t enjoy it."
Her Story,"The start is slow, once you clear the mountains and get into valentine it picks up"
Her Story,"I had a hard time getting into it the first time as well. I tried again and loved it. I agree the beginning snow part is a slog and hard to get through, but it’s worth it. (I’m not into Wild West cowboy stuff either, normally)"
Her Story,"If the game is slow now it'll be slow to you forever lol. It's a deliberately slow game, so if that's not your style it won't get better"
Her Story,"Don't buy it, it's a brilliant game but it's clearly not for you if you not only tried it and hated it but if you harbor feelings like ""they cough half the game and die"".  Seems to me like you don't even want to like the game lol.  Don't buy it."
Her Story,Red Dead Redemption 2 is a deep story open world single player experience. If you didn't like it the first time I can tell you rn that the details ain't gonna last you a long time giving it a second chance especially if you know the story already and don't like it.
Her Story,"If you didn't get into it before, I wouldn't recommend it. The game is a lot of fun for a while, but there are just too many missions with the same story beats for my taste"
Her Story,You already answered the question. No. Find something else to play.
Her Story,You enjoy interactive games with active flow. Your blood would boil by watching same 10 second animation for the 3rd time. People are coping on RDR2's slightest details to unsee how unbelievably flat the game is.
Her Story,Yes
Her Story,"I highly recommend just watching the “movie” of it on YouTube. It’s a great story, but it’s not fun for me to play. 

Also the all hidden Easter eggs videos on YouTube. You can play the game and spend 10+ mins riding around to go see it, or just watch them all with no work. I get nothing out of riding around on a horse for long periods. I live in Colorado, I can go do that irl and get the same scenery. But I do thoroughly enjoy watching the content in the game. 

I think you can save the game before big missions. So if you have a friend who has it, just ask them to save the game before missions you wanna play, and only play those parts so you skip the cutscenes masquerading as gameplay."
Her Story,Yes
Her Story,Yes
Her Story,"I'd say yes, and do one of two things. (or both, I guess)

A) Slip into the cowboy roleplay. I, too, did not really care for cowboy wildwest stuff and thought it was incredibly fucking slow, especially during the early snow section like you mentioned. It turned me off and I stopped playing for awhile. But, like you, I *wanted* to enjoy it just becauss everyone talked so highly of it. So I went on reddit and asked for suggestions to enjoy it. The most helpful answer was to just *give in* to the slowness; don't play the game with expectations other than ""I'm gonna be a cowboy today"" and just go with the flow. Instead of trying to run through things at my personal pace like most games allow, let the game lead the way. Don't rush, just do; don't pay any mind about how you wanna get to the ""fun part""; dont look forward to the ""next big moment"", just be happily surprised when you happen to stumble into it. Sorta like in Minecraft or games like it, you don't cut through a game like that; you just move along and try to have fun in the intermediary moments between your goals of getting diamond armor or building a house or something. I learnt to do that with this game and it went from something I considered over hyped to one of my favorite games of all time, that I have now replayed many many times. A shift of perspective can change *everything*.

B) Stop caring about the context and tone, and just fuck around. You may have to slog through some parts (the intro) but you can just be silly in the sandbox the game presents to you. Don't roleplay, don't treat it like some epic cinematic piece, don't take it too seriously and relax *that* way. Play the game like you used to play Grand Theft Auto games as a kid, before you could understand or even care for the plot or mechanics; when games were *just* games. Jump around, die a lot, shoot things, commit crimes, and most of all: laugh at the stupid absurdity of over-the-top explosions, screams, and ragdoll physics.

Hope it works out OP. Most of all, I think we all deserve to find the enjoyment in something everyone else has, and I hope you manage to find what we have. Have fun :)"
Her Story,Yes.
Her Story,"Most people will probably say yes, but imo you should not buy it. It's an incredibly boring game. Unless you like riding your horse for 15 minutes at a time or doing super repetitive shooting galleries with mediocre and brainless combat, you won't like this game. The story is decent but not nearly as good as it's cracked up to be, and it drags on for way too long. This game does have amazing graphics and it's a strong technical achievement from an open world perspective, but it just has super boring gameplay and the art style is lacking creativity. Basically it is a super boring and bland game that is technically well made in certain areas. Very vanilla"
Her Story,So basically you’re marketing valve. Ok. Just say that.
Her Story,I fucking hated that game. It was a massive waste of time and I quit at the epilogue because absolutely nothing notable happens.
Her Story,Don’t know if you’re still looking but I was in the exact same boat as you but I’ve been seeing TikTok’s and other videos of people reacting to the end for awhile now and I told myself i want to experience all this bs people were experiencing and man I didn’t look back after starting it again 2 weeks ago. I’m on my second play through now and I’m easily willing to say it’s the best story game ever made. It seems simple just to say he dies and that’s it but leading up to it and the character development is second to none it’s turned into one of if not my favourite game ever.
Her Story,"get it focuh! oh wait, you already have 😆"
Her Story,No.
Her Story,"It you tried it, thought it was boring, have had the story spoiled for you and don't like that either, then what would you be buying it for?"
Her Story,"No, it doesn’t really pick up pace too much, it’s a slow burn for sure. Probably my second favorite game of all time, but it’s definitely not for you from what you described, I love western movies and To me I just imagined it as a very long western movie."
Her Story,"I was in the same boat. I played Red dead 1. Spent countless time hunting, selling. Then I bought RDR2 ultimate edition with the geared up horse in story mode. Didn’t find much use at the time. I went through the story and got to a point where I got bored. (Edit: I used cheats, upgraded the camp fully maxed out, went through some hours, pulled an all nighter pretty much and realized I wasn’t able to save once the cheats were enabled. That’s why I gave up. I hadn’t even El left the first camp yet.)  Fast forward, I pick the game back up 2 years later once I seen how good of an all time game it is on beat games of all time rankings. Perplexed, I really took my time and got HOOKED! Once you get invested into the actual story and characters, it will start to bring out your emotions. By the end of it I dropped a tear. Just Stay away from online. It’s really an all time great once you actually get into the dialogues and not skip everything. Once you start hunting certain legendary animals to complete nice looking gear, Find ways to successfully rob a train without getting caught, bank robberies, times where you and the gang stick by each other and have wars. Even after my first full playthrough you REALLY appreciate each character a lot more. Give it a chance! I could keep going but it’s already super long to read"
Her Story,"Exactly. This seems like a pointless post.

Hey guys, should I buy this game I’m not into at all?"
Her Story,"well but last of us is not an open world game, and rdr2 is too slow for such a big game"
Her Story,"I liked TLOU but couldnt get into RDR2. 

It's one thing for a game to be slow but RDR2 just doesn't respect my time. I played it for like 3-4 hours and already felt like I spent way too much time just watching a dude ride a horse. If you want to do a cutscene, just do a cutscene, don't force me to make my guy move in a cinematic shot while him and his homies just ride along in silence."
Her Story,"They are incredibly different games though. One is very linear with tight story beats as you finish a fight or travel a short distance. RDR2 has a lot of riding around and is a VERY slow burn, especially early on."
Her Story,"I agree with this.  I started the game over when I got my deck (previously played a bunch though game pass on my Xbox) and the beginning felt like it took forever.  Once you’ve gotten a bit more established and can explore from camp I think it gets a lot more fun.  That being said you have to evaluate for yourself what was not fun about it.  You still ride a horse everywhere and the combat mechanics are the same.  I think the immersion, exploration and random encounters make it really fun."
Her Story,Any other suggestions for people that like action driven games? Ps5 player
Her Story,☝️ that last sentence especially.
Her Story,It’s like a Tarantino film like the hateful 8. It’s super slow and suspenseful. You don’t really know what’s gonna happen for a long long time. And then it all comes together. I think the ending is worth it like in the hateful 8 but it is a long way to get there and it doesn’t become clear what’s gonna happen until late game.
Her Story,Sounds like you rushed through the story if you think the only gameplay is horseriding and shooting galleries
Her Story,"This game certainly isn't for everyone. But, *all* games sound boring if you just boil them down to their basics like you just did.

This game certainly has a *lot* of valid criticisms, but your paragraph was just a template to make a game sound boring. I could copy and paste it and put a dozen different game titles in place of RDR2, and it would make *all* of them sound like garbage.

Also something I'd like to say, that applies to gamers in general and not just this instance, is that not *all* games have to reinvent the (gaming) wheel and have never-before-seen ultra-unique artstyles or gameplay in order for them to be simply enjoyable experiences; and *not* adhering to that philosophy doesn't make a game trash. There's nothing wrong with a game doing something that has been done before. There's also nothing wrong with a game using its *main* gameplay mechanic more than once. That's like... all games. Saying something is ""repetitive"" is a matter of personal opinion and not actually critical substance. If it were, then nearly every game should be knocked down for being ""repetitive."""
Her Story,"Thank god I thought I was the only one with this opinion. Personally I enjoyed RDO waaay more than RDR2 SP, just because of the reduction or outright nullification of the incredibly slow and tedious actions. Skinning, looting corpses, taking stuff off of shelves etc. I did like the story but like you said, it started feeling like it was dragging on past its own good after Chapter 5. Honestly Chapter 5 could've been removed entirely IMO and then the story would've been a good length.

Edit: Not to mention that coming from RDO where everything was more fast paced, When I saw how slow every action was I basically felt like I was forcing myself through the story. Maybe if I had learned of the fact that you can fast travel from anywhere to any settlement / POI on the map, it would've helped."
Her Story,If you’ve played the first one it’s all the better as well
Her Story,Was about to comment this lol.
Her Story,I probably should've just commented that exact sentence. Think I was a little peeved at the oversimplification of the story and ranted a bit lol.
Her Story,"No it's not open world, but it's story driven single player. 

You could also play it more linear, just straight up go from mission to mission. You'd be missing a lot of what makes the game so great i.e. the small details and moments, but you'd get the jist of the story. 

Like someone said, if you really don't like it, don't buy it, but I think you'd be missing out by not giving it the time it deserves. To each their own."
Her Story,"Most of the rides involved conversation when you ride with someone. Yes, there's a lot of horse riding, but, it is a cowboy game, and personally I think the horse riding is one of the best feeling mechanics of the game, but I hear you. Overall the time spent on horseback felt worth it to me"
Her Story,"I know, I guess I just meant in terms of being story driven and with great character arcs. They're obviously very different games, but I feel like I was emotionally invested for similar reasons."
Her Story,"What else is there? Hunting and fishing? Mini games? Messing around with NPCs? That stuff is boring 

RDR2 is one of those games that's as wide as an ocean and as deep as a puddle. It has all these bells and whistles, but they are all shallow. The game is a slog and a half"
Her Story,">This game certainly isn't for everyone. But, all games sound boring if you just boil them down to their basics like you just did.

That's not true at all. Super Mario Bros 3 is basically just constant platforming with nothing else. That doesn't sound boring at all, especially since the platforming is so good in the game.

The problem with RDR2 is that the combat, a huge part of the gameplay, is just genuinely bad. The 3rd person shooter mechanics are so clunky that the game is basically forced to rely on auto aim. Otherwise, it's barely even functional. It's basically a 2010 style cover shooter with zero enemy variety whatsoever and zero challenge or difficulty. The combat in RDR2 is truly a huge weak spot of the game. It also has a tedious overall gameplay loop. I'm not just boiling it down to the basics, I'm accurately describing the game. You ride your horse for about 5 - 10 minutes, getting a bunch of exposition from a character. Then, you arrive at a shooting gallery and engage with the awful combat. Rinse and repeat for 60 hours. That's just an accurate description of the game.

>not all games have to reinvent the (gaming) wheel and have never-before-seen ultra-unique artstyles or gameplay in order for them to be simply enjoyable experiences;

I literally never said they did. The problem with the gameplay in RDR2 is that it is tedious and not enjoyable for the reasons I mentioned. The combat and mission structures are just poorly designed. As for the art style, it's just a bland, realistic historical setting (and a lame historical setting at that). Yes, it is immersive, but there is no creativity to it 

>If it were, then nearly every game should be knocked down for being ""repetitive.""

That's not true, games that are actually good avoid being repetitive by actually having deep gameplay systems. Super Mario Bros 3 doesn't get repetitive because the platforming is so robust and they constantly have unique levels that change up the gameplay. Zelda doesn't get repetitive because it has such a wide variety of different puzzles that are solved in different ways. A Souls game doesn't get repetitive because it has such a wide variety of enemies and bosses with different move sets that requires you to constantly adjust to each combat scenario. Meanwhile RDR2 has zero enemy variety whatsoever in the combat, every shooting gallery is the same mindless auto aim situation. The only times the games mixes things up are in a small handful of big set pieces, but the vast majority of the game is repeating the same shallow gameplay systems over and over. The game is repetitive because the gameplay is shallow"
Her Story,"Nah, you said it well."
Her Story,"yes but going straight to the next mission means like 10 minutes of horse riding to do a 5 minute mission and so on,,,

there's no issue going slow when you know where you're going

like i get why someone might love rdr2, how inmersive it might be if you want to check every corner and every sunset, but for me it feels purposeless because I'd rather be having fun (for example, death stranding the walking simulator never made going from place A to place B boring, because it wasn't just a chore but the core of the gameplay and story)"
Her Story,"Sure, but even then they are vastly different. A single player game being story driven is incredibly common, and great character arcs are subjective; but even that's wildly different. One is a western where a guy largely on his own is trying to find his own way in a world that is rapidly changing with industrialization (more so RDR1 than 2, but it was still for sure present). Where with TLOU the character arc was driven with this adoptive father daughter bond as these people create a bond going through this dangerous and post-apocalyptic hellscape.

I could make a massive list on how incredibly different they are and really can't come up with much on how they are similar without being too subjective."
Her Story,"....this is such an L take. 

""What else is there to do???!?!!""

Then lists other things to do, 

""oh that stuff is bOrInG."""
Her Story,"I thought death stranding was pretty boring. I absolutely love riding the horses (also, if you set a marker and use cinematic camera, you don't have to hold the controller, he'll ride automatically). But there's so much to see along the way. Half the time I'd get so distracted riding from one place to another I'd forget all about the story missions. It's game to have to role play a little in, rather than ""playing a game"", tie your horse up, walk slowly to your next conversation, wear a light shirt when it's hot, a jacket when it rains, etc. Again, sounds like you don't need us to tell you not to buy it."
Her Story,"Again, sure. Obviously the settings are different and so are the stories. Overall, I had similar emotional investments in them. Cried at the end of both, no other games have ever done that for me. 

It's not that I'm saying they're similar games, as much as that, everyone I know who loves one, loved the other. They appeal to similar audiences for different, but in some ways, similar reasons. Both have complex characters and stories, difficult decisions made by those characters, love is a theme, betrayal, trust. Different games, different settings, different stories, but both are what I consider ""adult"" games. Not just rated M for blood and violence, but it takes a level of emotional maturity to grasp any of the themes and concepts of both."
Her Story,"So the other things to do in the game are a bunch of shallow bells and whistles 

Like I said, the game is wide as an ocean and as deep as a puddle"
Her Story,"yeah i know none of us is trying to convince each other, just showing our point of view

the cinematic riding is one of the things that bore me so much, because I get that the game is beautiful, i cannot deny that, but it's like an unskippable cutscene that doesn't even have like a ""purpose"".
But I completely understand why someone might love it, maybe there'll be a moment where even i will find the joy of that, but for now, I have difficulties playing games where I feel i don't have a purpose or whatever"
Her Story,"Not shallow at all. There are many, many other things to do, as well....hardly any of it ""shallow"". Sounds like you just don't *want* to enjoy the game, like you made up your mind without even giving it a chance.  If you are trying to not have a good time, then you obviously won't have a good time playing it."
Her Story,"Interesting to say you don't feel purpose, because the riding is always taking you somewhere for a reason. Granted, I'll just ride around aimlessly because I think it's so fun and peaceful. I've logged in many times with no intention of doing a mission and never even pull my gun, just to ride around for 30 minutes, make camp, maybe fish or if I do pull a weapon it's to hunt. Plus, there are what feel like endless random encounters; gang camps, kkk meets, attacks, home invasions, ambushes, stick up crews, mysteries and so much more. I think that's part of what never made riding boring, something always popped up along the way."
Her Story,Why would I buy a game and not want to enjoy it? This just sounds like you using copium because you're mad that I criticized a game you like
Her Story,"maybe I lack the patience or the time to let it set in

I guess it's that the main story feels like side mission and not the other way around; I really love when doing side missions will let me level up or award me with something so when I approach the next mission I feel prepared

I really wanted to enjoy rdr2, and I felt lile I couldn't, or maybe it's the hype since I played for the first time this month and the game came out years ago when maybe the vastness and complexity of the game would have amazed me more"
Her Story,"It doesn't make a difference to me if you like it, or not. 

My problem is with you making it out to be something it isn't. Also, it sounds like you are hopping on the contrarian train of hating on the game simply *because* it's so popular.

Either way, sounds like we will never agree on anything about this game, so it would be pointless to continue. 

Take care."
Her Story,"It's more because you critics is far away from what is questionable in this game, RDR2 is world renown as one of the best open world game with an amazing story and acting, it's not because you made critics and ppl are not okay with your point that what you say is true.

>mediocre and brainless combat  
>  
> The story is decent but not nearly as good as it's cracked up to be  
>  
>super boring gameplay and the art style is lacking creativity

It's funny because what you say doesn't match at all what ppl don't like in this game, so it's just your opinion.  
  
I don't like Fortnite but i can change the fact that he marked the BR genre forever even if i say otherwise all day, it's the same for RDR2 and plenty of others games.  
  
I wonder what you best of the best games."
Her Story,"Yeah, it's not an RPG in that sense, there isnt any leveling up, some side missions might get you a new weapon or outfit piece, but mostly they'll make you some money (especially the treasure hunts) to buy those things for yourself. Overall it's actually pretty straight forward as far as game systems go. Even though it's ""cowboy GTA"" it's very much not a GTA game in terms of pace or unlockables. The game still is a stunning achievement and I've played through twice on PS4 and twice on PC plus a ton of online, and I'm extremely likely to play it again. I think the last of us part 2 is the best game I've ever played, but rdr2 is my favorite game of all time, easily."
Her Story,">It doesn't make a difference to me if you like it, or not. 

Then why are you getting so up in arms about it lol?

>My problem is with you making it out to be something it isn't

And yet you haven't actually been able to address any of the criticisms 

>Also, it sounds like you are hopping on the contrarian train of hating on the game simply because it's so popular.

I like plenty of popular games. Again, you're just looking for any copium excuse you can think of"
Her Story,"The lackluster combat and outdated mission structure absolutely are common critiques of the game 

And no offense, but RDR2 is just a game that appeals to the lowest common denominator"
Her Story,I wish i had a ps4 or 5 to play TLOU2 :-(
Her Story,"I haven't been up in arms about anything... Actually, I tried to end this before it devolved. I see you like the word copium. That's cool. Again, as I said, we will never agree about anything to do with this game, or it seems, anything at all. So again, take care."
Her Story,"Well you're very sure about your point and, as always, very proud about not liking something commonly liked, i advise you just to not say ""it's very shallow"" or ""it's the worst"" because this is no sense compared to the millions of ppl who think it's a masterpiece.

You can dislike it but gather some real issue about this game, one i can give it's some annoying bugs about trinket that are present from the first day.

And again what your best games ?"
Minit,RDR2 is an absolute triumph. It MUST be played.
Minit,"I would generally recommend RDR2, which is one of the best games ever made.

Presentation is absolutely stunning across the board. Graphics, SFX, music, voice acting, all are absolutely stellar.

Gameplay-wise is also phenomenal. Essentially, to summarise, it plays as a 3rd-person shooter, with some RPG and simulation elements - it really shines in making you *feel* like the character you're playing as, that is, a cowboy in the late 19th/early 20th century, with all the gambling, outlawing, hunting, etc.

The content available is frankly some of the best value in any videogame. This is the most well-realised open-world game ever, in my estimation - an immersive world that feels natural and alive, that exists independently of you but reacts to your decisions. The story is fully fleshed out, dramatic, personal and intimate, but also self-aware enough to shine all the wild west tropes through. You have further an entire online mode that I haven't even touched yet.

When considering the preferences you laid out, I'm even more convinced you'll enjoy it. I'd recommend it over cyberpunk to anyone, but even more to someone with your preferences."
Minit,"RDR2 is probably the better made game but I also loved Cyberpunk, it’s story, and it felt very creative and new. I liked someone else’s idea of doing RDR2 and buy Cyberpunk when DLC comes out so you can transition straight to DLC"
Minit,"Love both, but I’d start with RDR2 buddy. And just know, it’ll be awhile before you start Cyberpunk once you get immersed into that work and Aruthur"
Minit,U can miss cyberpunk. U cant pass on RDR2! Easy as that
Minit,"Rdr2 without a doubt. The most beautiful open world, lots of chill out time, lots of random and very well written scripted quests, a sense of history with a bit of the absurd, and a tragic crime family story. It will give you a thrill, make you feel like a badass, and then leave you in tears."
Minit,"I’m sure there will be a Complete Edition for Cyberpunk/Phantom Liberty, so wait on that. Cyberpunk was great; loved the story, Night City and the RPG elements. Granted I played on PS5 when that version was released. 

Red Dead Redemption II is one of the greatest games ever made. Five years later and it’s still worth full price. The quantity and quality of content is impressive."
Minit,RDR2
Minit,"As someone that was super hyped cyberpunk and hit it day 1, as faulty and buggy as it was at the time on my ps4, I enjoyed it, and now 100 times better with the next gen update and all on my ps5, that being said, RDR2 was one of the best games of the last generation, and it plays great on next gen consoles… definitely recommend RDR2, it’s not an rpg but getting lost in that world and along with the things you discover in it are very rpg like to me, definitely recommend RDR2"
Minit,"RDR2.

Cyberpunk is cool, but it will be much cooler in a few months with the update/remake

I also would only get cyberpunk if you have at least a PS5/next gen/pc"
Minit,Red dead redemption until cyberpunk dlc is released
Minit,"No question, RDR2 all the way!"
Minit,"I feel like RDR2 is a much better overall game, but is more divisive than you would be lead to believe. It's a slow burn story game, so if you're cool with that, it's way better.

Cyberpunk is exactly as you expect it to look and feel."
Minit,"Cyberpunk base game is also been a lot of improvements when the DLC releases so get cyberpunk then with the DLC, for now its time for RDR2 Boah!!"
Minit,RDR2
Minit,RDR2 without a doubt
Minit,"Red dead, even though I mostly play rpgs. Even though it’s fairly polished now I just find Cyberpunk to be boring. Idk I hope someday I can engage with it but it’s not now."
Minit,"RDR2

Cyberpunk is also a very good game, and I do recommend you play it eventually

But with the DLC just around the corner (only three months away in fact) you should wait until it releases before getting it"
Minit,"Wait for the DLC and play RDR2 while you wait. I personally liked Cyberpunk more, but RDR2 is amazing aswell."
Minit,"Rdr2 and I liked both of them, but RDR2 is on another level"
Minit,Rdr2
Minit,"RDR2 is the most polished game I have ever played. The environments are highly-interactive and the world with it’s animals and people respond to you and each other in a very believable way. It’s story is an engaging epic action-drama grounded in reality. It’s extremely immersive.

CP2077 had very rough beginnings and, when I last played it late last year, that roughness still shows through on what otherwise feels like quite a nice game. Everyone knows about the bugs, so there’s no point mentioning them more here.  The physical environments and sound design are very well set up. But the NPCs populating the world will behave in ways that might break your immersion. When a gun is fired, they will all crouch in the same animation and despawn as soon as you aren’t looking. Police will spawn in on top of you when you commit a crime and don’t put up any chase when you flee. Feels disappointing in a world constructed around the notion of constant police-gang struggle. Supposedly this is slated to be reworked in the future.
The world has some interactivity more on par with games like dishonored 2. Dialogue feels particularly strong and the story is, in my experience, engaging. 
One strange thing is the character customisation. One premise of the world building is ‘fashion over function’. How you look is supposedly as important as how you act on the world of 2077. But this is totally at odds with the actual game mechanics. You will be heavily encouraged to wear clothes for their stats, not their appearance, and that will lead to some pretty weird costume combos. It doesn’t matter much because the game is entirely first person perspective, but that begs the (controversial?) question of why have a player model at all."
Minit,Yes red dead redemption is much better on many levels right off the bat.
Minit,Rdr2
Minit,"Rdr2 100%. In my opinion it’s the best/most realistic video game ever made. The only downside is it’s ruined every game I’ve played after it. Either the graphics look terrible, the story is dumb, gaming mechanics aren’t as good etc.."
Minit,"Hands down, RDR2. While I enjoyed Cyberpunk for what it is, I don't think that's a close call by almost any metric."
Minit,"Red Dead Redemption 2 by far; I 100% Cyberpunk 2077, I did not 100% Red Dead.  Cyberpunk doesn't not have a lot of depth, unfortunately, its presentation is good and certainly has gotten better since launch but literally the only time I would even talk about it in the same breath as RDR2 is a question like yours, in terms of quality and depth and content, it doesn't hold a candle to RDR2.

There is of course a difference in setting to consider, but just keep in mind that while the 'cyberpunk' aesthetic is certainly present in Cyberpunk 2077, I'd argue it doesn't even do it as well as games like Shadowrun for SNES or Shadowrun for Genesis.  That may seem harsh, but again I did everything you could do in this game, it really doesn't have much going for it."
Minit,RDR2
Minit,"I would wait for the the dlc for Cyberpunk as it seems it will be some kind of mega side quest and will bring improvements to the base game as well, rdr2 is hit or miss I guess depending on people, it's a slow paced game but amazing visuals, story and immersion but with that said I finished cyberpunk and still will come back for the dlc, the game has a pretty big replayability if you like trying different approach to combat"
Minit,"If you don't mind a slow burn for massive payoff then go for RDR2. You'll want to wait to play CP2077 until Phantom Liberty releases as they're doing an overhaul of the base game too.

Edit: Liberty not Pain"
Minit,RDR2
Minit,"No, it's not Next-Gen Optimized, but still RDR2 all day every day"
Minit,"RDR2 is the superior game in my opinion. Cyberpunk is pretty bland in comparison. However, Cyberpunk has better performance in that, it can run at 60 fps on next- gen consoles (whereas RDR2 is locked at 30 fps) and is better optimized on PC, though still expect bugs. Also, RDR2 can be overwhelming with its size and detail, Cyberpunk is much smaller in scale."
Minit,RDR 2 if you like a beautiful masterpiece
Minit,"I just started RD2 on PC about a week ago and it’s absolutely sensational.

I do plan on getting CP after the new DLC comes out tho, and after I finish the main story in RD2!"
Minit,You like computers or cowboys?
Minit,"Seems like they’re going to add lots of fixes to the new gen consoles version of cyberpunk along with the expansion, so I think you should play RDR2 until a much better version of cyberpunk is out."
Minit,RDR2.
Minit,Red Dead Redemption 2
Minit,"Wait for the Dlc of Cyberpunk, the game will get a massive overhaul with it"
Minit,"RDR2 is the most polished game I have ever played. The environments are highly-interactive and the world with it’s animals and people respond to you and each other in a very believable way. It’s story is an engaging epic action-drama grounded in reality. It’s extremely immersive.

Minit,Red Dead 2
Minit,RDR2 duh. CP2077 world and setting is unlike anything I've seen before so that's why I liked it but the story and gameplay was just ok to me.
Minit,"RD2 

Wait for cyberpunks expansion and then get it. It’s a good game on its own. Think Skyrim but in a cyberpunk setting. Yes is failed on some major systems they were supposed to have. Supposedly they are reworking a ton which will drop with the new expansion in September"
Minit,Red Dead. Definitely Red Dead.
Minit,RDR 2 hands down!
Minit,rdr2 for sure!
Minit,Rdr2
Minit,"I might get some hate, but i enjoyed cyberpunk way more than i did rdr2. Maybe rdr2 was too tedious for me, or i didnt like the setting so much. Not sure, still a masterpiece though. 
Still id get cp2077"
Minit,Red Dead Redemption 2
Minit,RDR2. By a mile!
Minit,"There has recently (as in, this weekend) been an article about the Cyberpunk DLC. Along side it is an overall of almost every system. The state its in now, Cyberpunk is *fine.* The open world feels so dead and empty, with nothing ever changing. You can stand and watch a NPC for 5 hours, and they will not move from there spot. The gunplay is fantastic, and the story is good, although that's of course subjective) I think part of that will be changing, along with the many other little tweaks they will be making, along side adding the DLC. So I would hold off. 

&#x200B;

RDR2, in contrast is amazing. The story, combat, graphics are wonderful and I don't have much bad to say about the game. My only complaint is the pacing of the story. It drags on a little to much, but at the same time, that's kind of the point? So It seems a weird complaint. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, TL;DR- Buy RDR2, Hold of on Cyberpunk until the DLC is released"
Minit,Red dead 2. That game is forever in my heart
Minit,"If you like RPG games, go for cyberpunk. But if you want an experience go for RDR2. Many people say that rdr2 doesn’t have a good story, but I believe that it is amazing. But I think everyone will agree that rdr2 has the best protagonist of all time, Arthur Morgan."
Minit,[deleted]
Minit,"It took me almost 70h to complete the main story in RDR2 that is without any side missions or free roaming.

Done the cyberpunk main story a lot of side quests and done some free roaming all under 50h"
Minit,Both are great but I'd wait for Cyberpunk fixes and qol that come with the expansion so RDR2 first
Minit,"RDR2 is probably the better made game but I also loved Cyberpunk, it’s story, and it felt very creative and new. I liked someone else’s idea of doing RDR2 and buy Cyberpunk when DLC comes out so you can transition straight to DLC"
Minit,"I completed cyberpunk 3x with lowered graphics and shit fps. (Roll on phantom liberty with a 3080)

I didnt finish RDR2s first? Second? Act.

Dont get me wrong, I think RDR2 is an amazing game, probably the better one, but these are the facts lol."
Minit,Rdr2.  Then In September you can get CP when it gets somewhat overhauled by developers
Minit,Why is that even a question? RDR2 should be the default answer to this.
Minit,Get both honestly. They are both masterpieces of games. I personally enjoy Cyberpunk a lot more but they are both fantastic in terms of story and gameplay.
Minit,Cp 2077
Minit,"I'd go with RDR2 first and, depending on how much free time you have, by the time you're done with it there'll probably be some version of Cyberpunk with Phantom Liberty included. Either way you'll have a great time with both, enjoy!"
Minit,"I admit that rdr2 is the better made game,  I just got bored by it.  Cyberpunk was way more fun and engaging to me. I played on a pretty good pc, and didn't really have any expectations going into the game,  so I wasn't soured by anything.

Rockstar games kinda just bore me tbh. After playing the ps2 gta games to death,  any Rockstar game after just feels like it plays the exact same."
Minit,I love Cyberpunk and never had bug issues. You should 100% get red dead as it’s probably the best game ever created.
Minit,Red Dead Redemption 2 is already a complete game. Cyberpunk still needs polishing and should be even more solid after the expansion comes out in September. RDR2 will hold you until then.
Minit,"if u have a series console, ps5, or high end pc, get cyberpunk for 30$ plus the expansion for another 30$. if u don't have that, then id say RDR2"
Minit,"Have both and played both.  
RDR2 is super immersive and so finely tuned - but it is an open world Rockstar game so it's going to be a bit overwhelming, at least it was to me.  
Cyberpunk is also open world but a bit more linear.  It has that Skyrim like maneuverability where things can get wonky but it allows the player more freedom. 

I'd say go for cyberpunk and just play it now so you have an understanding of the game and story before the dlc comes out."
Minit,"I have both.

Cyberpunk is more of RPG style than RDR2. There's skill points and such to distribute. RDR2 increases stats for you based on what you do.

Cyberpunk's AI have health bars, red dead's doesn't. It's more immersive for that reason.

RDR2 is much slower pace, but has a lot more to explore. The scenery can be breath-taking and sometimes hard to fathom how good it looks. 

Cyberpunk has a lot of nothing, but it still looks pretty cool. Nice graphics.

So far, I like cyberpunk's story but it can seem a bit all over the place.

RDR2 has been easier to follow."
Minit,"If you just want a decent story with an immersive world and nice graphics, RDR2 is fine for that. It has pretty terrible gameplay, and it's a brain-dead easy game that treats players like they have 60 IQ. If you just want to turn off your brain for 60-hours and play through a decent story, then it fits the bill. Especially if you like the wild west and spaghetti western movies, then you will probably like RDR2. 

Cyberpunk has way better art direction than RDR2, but the game is severely lacking in terms of a lot of its open world systems. It has nowhere near as immersive of an open world as RDR2. The setting and visuals are a lot cooler, but the actual execution isn't there. The combat is not very good, but it's at least better than RDR2 in this area. It also has RPG systems and build variety which RDR2 doesn't have. Overall I'd say just wait until the DLC drops, because apparently they have reworked a lot of aspects of the game. CP2077 really does have a lot of potential, so if the DLC lives up to the hype, then it could be a game changer."
Minit,I just tried cyberpunk a couple weeks ago off a freinds familyshare and its still super buggy to the point where i wound up getting fed up with the bugs and uninstalling. I would have felt very cheated if it was a game i payed for. So i would go with RDR2
Minit,"Everyone says RDR2 is the best game ever, but the janky controls are super frustrating and honestly it’s pretty slow at times. I don’t need to watch long animations every time I pick something up or do anything. It’s more cowboy sim than game. 

Tried it 3 times and never make it past 10 hrs or so."
Minit,[deleted]
Minit,Both
Minit,Mount a blade bannerlord has great rpg mechanics you can literally be anything in that world
Minit,I would only choose Cyberpunk solely because it has next gen support. RDR2 is a fantastic game but lacks that kind of support which makes me personally not touch it ever since I beat it back in 2018.
Minit,"RDR2. It’s a much more immersive game and story. Cyberpunk is a great game too, but I don’t find the story as good at all. The pros about cyberpunk are extreme weapon customization and playstyle customization with perk trees. When I play RDR2 I feel like I’m in the story, and when I play Cyberpunk I feel like I’m in a gigantic beautiful sandbox game."
Minit,Cyberpunk
Minit,"RDR2 is much more story rich and interactive compared to cyberpunk. It only takes around 30 hours to complete the main mission, spoiler alert ( when doing the last mission after doing so you get back to prior of starting the last mission to finish anything else to basically you don't fully finish it). It has nice features, ray tracing, and a nice environment, but RDR2 beats it in every other way. That's from my opinion as i have both and played both for 100 hours plus on each."
Minit,"Cyberpunk has better writing and combat. Rdr2's world is more detailed, alive and polished. 
I prefer cyberpunk.
Most people seem to prefer rdr2."
Minit,"RDR2. Ive played both and Cyberpunk really lacks in a lot of areas and i didn’t get much enjoyment from it after completing the main story line. RDR2 however is a game that ive replayed numerous times and spent upwards of 400 hours combined playing, most of it in free roam. Havent even touched the online yet."
Minit,"Cyberpunk's DLC will remain as a DLC, it seems to be set in a new city, but at this point, nothing can be done about the game's dullness and how unfun it is to play. I played it for 25 hours(right until the 3-race side mission were unlocked), and it's just boring, the plot is mediocre, the fighting, the gameplay are subpar, the only redeeming thing was how beautiful everything looked, and that's it"
Minit,I would be cautious with RDR2 on PC. I had to get a refund on it due to the game constantly crashing; the issues had to do specifically with the Rockstar games launcher which you are required to use.
Minit,"Rdr2 is a bit of an ancient game in terms of design. Missions force you to do things one way and if you don’t listen the game fails you. It’s also an aggressively easy game that just feels stiff and clunky mechanics wise. It’s got great voice acting, but I found the world and story pretty dull. Cyberpunk is a far more enjoyable game that gives you choices on how to handle each mission with much better combat and a much more interesting world to explore and a far more interesting story."
Minit,"This is a hard one, gotta do both haha"
Minit,neither buy rain world 😈😈
Minit,RDR2 no contest
Minit,"Depends, if you're on console I would skip RDR2, it still runs at 30FPS, rockstar doesn't care about next gen update."
Minit,"Neither, buy doom eternal"
Minit,I dont like rdr2 at all and like project red games
Minit,Cyberpunk. Red dead 2 is overrated imo
Minit,They’re both great go with what interests you more.
Minit,I've played both and I have some stronger critiques on RD2 than most but would still pick it over CP.
Minit,"Both games are amazing, i loved Cyberpunk it's story characters, scenery. currently playing RDR2 its really good, both games are great. I'd buy both if i were u"
Minit,Robots and guns or cowboys and guns
Minit,"I’d go for Cyberpunk personally. The game is really good as long as you take your time and do the side quests. There are a ton of really compelling stories that get told. I’d wait to play until Phantom Liberty releases though. The gameplay is already good, but it’s rumored they’re going to be shipping big improvements to key systems like the AI and the police systems (and possibly more) with the DLC."
Minit,I recommend getting both
Minit,"Both are incredible story games, depends on what you want. If you care about story and characters, go red dead, if you care about combat and replay ability go cyberpunk"
Minit,"Rdr2, 100000%"
Minit,Cyberpunk if you want action. Red dead if you don't mind watching a movie in game format.
Minit,Rdr2 cyberpunk has a lot of problems
Minit,RDR2
Minit,Red dead partner!
Minit,Red Dead is the better game hands down.
Minit,RDR2
Minit,Do you want to be a cowboy? If so…follow your heart
Minit,Cyberpunk has a big DLC coming soon.
Minit,"With the Phantom Liberty expansion, which overhaul all of cyberpunk. It will great to buy...


But RDR2 is a moderm masterpiece so it gets my vote"
Minit,"Cyberpunk is more action and adrenaline, Red Dead Redemption 2 is more laid back and slow-paced.  


Cyberpunk has been getting updates continually since release and is awesomely upgraded by this point...I never finished RDR2, but I finished Cyberpunk and am waiting at the edge of my seat for Phantom Liberty, which is going to be a *huge* DLC and should be later this year.  


Cyberpunk.  My two cents."
Minit,"RDR2, it's much more detailed and alive rather than cyberprank, tho I enjoyed cyberprank (played from friend's console) its just not within the same level of RDR2 also the balancing of story telling and action on RDR2 is peak unlike in cyberpunk you're always just sitting and listening"
Minit,I don’t usually post on reddit but i just want to make sure that you get RDR2
Minit,"Both are great, but I think Cyberpunk is the more engaging game. Red Dead suffers from the antiquated Rockstar game design. Almost no freedom during missions, you’re just railroaded through each section and must play it as the developers intend."
Minit,Red dead 2 is my pick. Cyberpunk was fun but i can’t just sit back and enjoy the world like i can with RDr2
Minit,"In my opinion, Red Dead Redemption 2 was an incredible experience, especially in the beginning and middle game. However, I found myself getting bored after reaching around 60% completion, as there weren't many new things to explore once I had acquired the best weapon. 

On the other hand, Cyberpunk had superior writing and enjoyable gameplay, but it did suffer from some noticeable bugs."
Minit,"RDR2 and anyone who says diff is crazy ive completed both games and theres just nothing that compares to RDR2 everything about it is so amazing but for me my fav thing about the game was the story telling. the best storytelling ive ever experienced in a game hands down. it could of been a oscar winning film. i literally cryed during a few scenarios in the game,"
Minit,Lol EASY choice. RDR2.
Minit,Are you on pc ? If you don’t wanna keep the games forever. I can tell you how to get them for like 2$ both on steam
Minit,"I vote rdr, as well. BUT, if you haven't played Witcher 3, that's another great one. Plus, it often heavily discounted."
Minit,RDR2 and its not even close
Minit,"Red dead 2. There isn’t a game that has immersed me more than this game, I play butt nekkid and pretend I’m a O’Driscol. 10 Cowboys out of 10"
Minit,"I’ve played both and loved both, but I fully believe that RDR2 is truly the best game ever, go with that first!"
Minit,"Rdr2 is very pretty and has some interesting things in it but from a gameplay perspective it's unbelievably barren. You don't even get to aim your gun in this game really and all the missions are basically ""walk here, listen to dialogue, kill guys"".

Cyberpunk at least has some depth to combat. It's a passable first person shooter. Not a great one mind you, but it works. The missions here are also just ""walk here, listen to dialogue, kill guys"".

Personally the dialogue in both these games puts me to sleep and that's like 70% of both. But I guess I would say the Rdr2 dialogue at least feels finished, whereas the cyberpunk dialogue very frequently feels like a placeholder."
Minit,RDR 2 is a no brainer in this case
Minit,"Cyberpunk over RDR2. While RDR2 is a great game, i found it slow, and alot of the “immersive” mechanics being pretty surface level and just boring. Unpopular take, but Cyberpunk is more fun."
Minit,I’d wait till the new expansion for CP2077 comes out. It’s supposed to bring a whole bunch of QOL changes to the base game.
Minit,RDR2
Minit,No
Minit,"RDR2 was fun, but I was more hyped for Cyberpunk 2077. Ended up not caring for RDR2 so much after burning myself out on it, but Cyberpunk absolutely failed me in almost every department. RDR2 is the way to go."
Minit,"Wait for the cyberpunk dlc to drop before you buy since they are redoing A LOT of the mechanics. I believe it’s September 26 so you have a lot of time to finish red dead. Plus the summer sale is soonish I think so you might be able to get the game and dlc for cheap depending on what price they set. 

I’ve played both and even though it’s been a while since I played cyberpunk and I just finished red dead 3 days ago both are excellent games in their own right but I’d probably play red dead before cyberpunk."
Minit,**\*\*\* me scrolling through the comments to find the crazy psychopath that chooses cyberpunk over rdr2 \*\*\***
Minit,Cyberpunk is fun but it doesn’t come close to RDR2.
Minit,"It depends on what type of games you like, red dead is more story based and polished, but cyberpunk is more ""fuck around and break the game"", but in a good way

Cyberpunk has leveling and a skill tree, and rdr doesn't, so I think you'd like it more

Also red dead was built with miracles or something because it runs like a dream"

Minit,Both games are really good but RDR2 is my favourite game all time so pick RDR2
Minit,"Both are great, but RDR2 is looong but with lots of content"
Minit,Rdr2
Minit,Cyberpunk is more fun. RDR2 gets crazy tedious
Minit,"Red Dead 2 is worth its weight in gold. The story is perfectly told, with some of the best voice acting I've ever heard in a video game. The world is vast, and you never feel like you're completely out of things to do. Bored of missions? Hunt some animals for upgrades to both your player or your camp. Tired of hunting? Put your criminal mind to robbing a store or train. Want to help the law? Check the local sheriff's office for a bounty. The list of activities goes on and on...


So to answer your question, take a break from the cybernetics and neon signs of Night City and go on a breathtaking journey through late 1800's America with Dutch Van der Linde and the gang!"
Minit,"Go with red dead and play cyberpunk after the last dlc comes out. There will probably some sale for a definitive edition down the line.

Both games are definitely worth to be played."
Minit,Do you prefer cowboys or cyborgs
Minit,Finished Rdr2 3 times already and would pay 200$to forget everything and start the game again without remembering anything. Cyberpunk I enjoyed the story but the game was full of bugs and lost the interest of playing it again even if it is fixed or not
Minit,"I played red dead 2 after it had been out for like 4 years not expecting much. I didn't even buy it, I played my brothers copy, that's the only reason I tried it. It turned out to be my favorite game ever. I'm not particularly interested in the wild west. It felt like watching a movie in the best way possible. It's the only game I can think of where I was sad because I knew it was ending soon. I can't recommend it enough.

I was excited for cyberpunk for years. I was incredibly disappointed when I finally was able to play it, I put about 20 hours in it and feel no urge to continue playing it. Even after they've patched it."
Minit,"All you need to do is listen to the song ""Video games"" by Tenacious D. You're welcome."
Minit,RDR2. Cyberpunk's getting totally reworked head to toe alongside new DLC in September and *that's* when you should buy it.
Minit,RDR2
Minit,rdr2
Minit,RDR2!
Minit,Hmph. Rdr2 is a masterpiece. Cyberpunk quite literally is bad. Phantom liberty sounds very promising on paper but we’ll have to see. So did this game pre release and I’d give it a 5/10.
Minit,Is this post by OP a joke?
Minit,RDR2
Minit,"Rdr2 has a much stronger plot and cast. And the world is gorgeous.

Cyberpunk is also fantastic and a lot of fun, BUT it’s a lot more you having to role play the character"
Minit,"Loved both, but like everyone has already said, start with RDR2. CP2077 is a fantastic game, but it will get better once the Phantom Liberty update comes out."
Minit,Rdr2 all day. By far my fav game all time.. online sux d tho.
Minit,I couldn't get into RDR2 personally. I was enjoying the story and it's the most beautiful game ever made but I thought the gameplay and controls were so rudimentary I stopped at Chapter 3. Meanwhile I really liked Cyberpunk especially the story and although its gameplay isn't groundbreaking it didn't stop me from finishing the game.
Minit,"Red dead, no doubt."
Minit,RDR2 is one of the best games humanity has ever witnessed
Minit,"Most people are saying RD2, but my vote is for Cyberpunk. Bugs aren't as bad now, and the story is great. Along with a bunch of different builds. You can be a ninja with a katana, a run and gun madman, or a tech savvy hacker. The atmosphere is great and helps tie everything together, and the characters you meet really make it amazing. Just like all of CDPR's games, they really go all out with side quests and side story characters. Plus, Phantom Liberty releases in September, so if it's on sale, I would go for it. Cyberpunk is by far one of my favorites, and honestly, RD2 doesn't even get close to my top games.
That being said, both Cyberpunk and RD2 are both amazing games. I just lean more towards Cyberpunk."
Minit,"I say pick up Cyberpunk, it might be worthwhile to play the game now, with the original story, before playing Phantom Liberty. As Phantom Liberty is very likely going to come with some new endings, and possibly some other changes outside the ones we already know.

Plus I just think its a good game, well worth the money nowadays after 1.5. Mods make it even more fun to play around with. Just an entertaining experience.

On top of that Cyberpunk is truly an RPG, it lets you choose your skills, pick different perks, use different weapons. You truly build your character the way you want. Its very similar to thinks likeSkyrim in that way. Where as Red Dead 2 is just the same character no matter what, there is no leveling system or anything. Its really more of an action adventure title than a true RPG. 

So if you want to get immersed into an RPG and its setting, in similar fashion to things like Skyrim, I recommend 2077."
Minit,RDR2 with no hesitation and do not read spoilers.
Minit,"Hey unpopular opinion time. I played both.

RDR2 is certainly a marvel. The story is amazing, graphics are second to none, the protagonist is probably the most well flushed out I've ever experienced in a game, and overall the game really is a must play.

....but it's a bit of a drag yeah? It's very slow paced, and I found myself just wanting to play other games from time to time. This isn't really a negative point, and is definitely subjective, but man it can DRAG. 



Cyberpunk (post patches) is a wild ride. The story is a blast, and really kicks. The set pieces are way above what I expected in an open world game. The side quests, as expected from CDPR are just as good, if not better than the main story in many cases. Definitely a case of art direction trumping graphical fidelity. While it doesn't look bad by any stretch... Walking though Chinatown in the middle of the night is a sight to behold. Vibrant neon lighting, crowded streets, some guy getting mugged in an alley, the constant cacophony of people shouting and talking... I haven't felt that level of immersion in a game... Maybe ever.

Yeah it's a bit of a mess. But way better than the sum of its parts. Unfortunately I listened to the online griping, and missed out for longer than necessary, but take from someone who was hesitant, it blew me away.

At the end of the day Cyberpunk is just ***fun***. The shooting is chunky and effective, the driving is arcady but feels good, the plot and characters are fucking bonkers, and there really are just so many ways to play the game.

I played it the first time as a learning curve. A little hacking, a little shotgun, a little melee. It was pure chaos and really felt like I was a newbie in night city trying to climb to the top.

Second time thru and I'm playing full stealth. Feels like a totally different game. I walk in an alley, activate my speed implant, turn invisible, and walk through putting a bullet in everyone's head. Come out the other side, and watch the bodies drop before the cameras ever had a chance to catch me. Suddenly I felt like an elite level assassin that was born and bred in this world.


You can't go wrong either way, but I tip towards CP"
Minit,"cyberpunk, rdr2 is a linear game in an open world setting with the most boring chapter 1 in existence, also everything you do (pointless animation) is so slow and infuriating that you can fall asleep"
Minit,I think rdr2 has more replayability if that matter to you as far as stretching your dollar. I dont find myself excitingly opening cyberpunk. I felt like 1 playthrough was enough to get a big grasp of the game.
Minit,"Rdr2 is a masterpiece. It’s slow paced but if you adapt your speed to it, rather than trying to force it to your speed, it’s fantastic! It is the most alive environment of any game I’ve played. Can interact with just about everything too. And npc’s actually seem like they are more than objects moving around the screen."
Minit,RDR2 is one of the greatest games ever made.
Minit,"I have both. The answer is both. Just get both, play them both for less than two-hours each, and refund the one you don’t want."
Minit,"Unquestionably RDR2 is the better, more fully realized game. 

I think the best question to answer from a prospective standpoint, however, is what is your preferred gaming experience? Do you like 'slow' as a concept? Do you enjoy being diverted from whatever you initially planned doing? If a game world is both fun and immersive, are you happy with killing an hour or two wandering around it and not focusing on story progression? If yes to all of the above, You will love RDR2. If you are very task oriented and want everything to be a quick hit, then RDR2 isn't going to be your cup of tea regardless of its (excellent) level of quality.

That's generally what people mean when they say this game is divisive. The less patient get frustrated with its deliberateness."
Minit,Wait until the Cyberpunk expansion comes out at a discount. It will probably be in its best state at that point.
Minit,"Red Dead 2 all the way. It took me like 3 attempts of replaying the beginning before I finally got hooked on the game and I wish it didn’t cause I’ve been missing out! 

It’s such a beautiful game. The guns are dope, (just experiment, you can’t lose unless you don’t like the gun which you can just store away) and the world is vast but alive

Like you’ll suddenly get ambushed or some fools will try to rob you; or woodcutters are felling trees, or a criminal is complaining on the back of a horse tied up"
Minit,I played both RDR2 on s a great experience but a little slower pace. Cyberpunk was broke and I fell off before I completed it
Minit,"Both are on sale pretty often but I would do RDR2 first without question. There are certain games you absolutely have to at least play. Don’t have to finish it if it don’t click but it’s an absolute must play. Cyberpunk is a great story with not the best gameplay, plus very raunchy. It’s gotten much better over the years however."
Minit,Red dead 2 is leagues better imo
Minit,Rdr2 is probably the best story in a game I have ever played. Full stop. It is genuinely one of the most amazing game stories there is. I would recommend it over cyberpunk based on that alone
Minit,Red Dead 1st by far
Minit,"Imo they are both very enjoyable from a story and gameplay angle. Some of it comes to taste (do you want a Wild West game or futuristic urban environment?). In my opinion you can’t go wrong but there is a reason Red Dead 2 is considered one of the greatest single player games of all time. 


Also, if this matters, cyberpunk is a 30-50 hour game if you complete the story and do a lot of side quests. Red dead 2 is more of a 50+ hour kind of game."
Minit,RDR2
Minit,I would say red dead now and cyberpunk later
Minit,"Cause I don't play video games no more
Never play video games
But Red Dead Redemption 2, that is not a game
It's an incredible journey through old American history
Fighting for your life and fighting for your family
Try to live your days with honor and integrity
That's not a game, that's an adult thing
That's not a game at all
That's like fuckin' Shakespeare
- Jack Black"
Minit,"Objectively RDR2 is the better game in almost every way, and it’s also cheaper right now. But man I can’t help but absolutely adore cyberpunk, even more than red dead. My brain says get red dead but my heart says get cyberpunk"
Minit,"Cyberpunk is pretty cool, but RDR2 is a goddamn masterpiece."
Minit,"If you like first person action RPG and sci -fi allot like I do Cyberpunk carried the magic. After the millionth plot twist I gave up on Rdr2, cyberpunk is short sweet and tragic."
Minit,I would say get red dead. It honestly looks like the better game out of the two and you can always get a refund if you really don't like it.
Minit,"Red dead 2, 100%"
Minit,Could not put RDR2 down finished in under a month. Cyberpunk took me at least 4.
Minit,99.9% of time my answer to this sub is just r/piratedgames
Minit,rdr2 all the way
Minit,Red Dead Redemption 2 !
Minit,Rdr 2
Minit,Both are amazing and should be played but get rdr2 first and wait till the new dlc to get cyberpunk.
Minit,"RDR2 is to date the best single game I’ve ever played by far.

It’s a masterpiece."
Minit,RDR2. Without a doubt.
Minit,RDR2
Minit,Do you want rootin tootin cowboy shootin or stressy messy cyborg depressy?
Minit,"I love both, but cyberpunk is good and RDR2 is next level amazing."
Minit,"In between missions, RDR2 is quite therapeutic to play."
Minit,"Late to the party, but would like to share my thoughts:

CP2077 has some fantastic writing and beautiful graphics. That being said, it’s a very shallow game in every other department. Given the world-building, it has amazing potential. If they had just given the game another couple years to incubate, it easily could’ve been one of the greatest action-adventure RPGs of its time. 

RDR2 is, on the other hand, *also* a game that has fantastic writing and beautiful graphics. It is, however, the type of game that *did* get the time it needed to fully flesh out all the other aspects of its gameplay. The result is a highly immersive experience with a lot of replayability and content that can last you hundreds of hours."
Minit,"It's not even really a fair comparison. 

RDR2 is a ridiculous rich and developed world with unbelievable detail (sometimes to much) and a story that is extremely engaging. It also has some of the best NPC reactions/interactions and is probably one of the top 3 hunting games in the last decade all rolled into one.

Cyberpunk is a mostly dead world with poor interactivity with npcs, a convoluted story that barely makes sense, and is almost entirely empty. I know I mentioned dead and empty twice but it needed repeating. The game had so much potential it didn't live up to its ridiculous. The games AI is almost as bad as basic vanilla skyrim back in the day. Luckily most of the bugs seem to have been dealt with but the game is still not worth buying in my opinion"
Minit,I've played both. They're both pretty good. Rdr2 is the best of the 2.
Minit,def red dead!
Minit,I have never met someone who didnt like rdr2 but cyberpunk seems to be hit or miss i have friends who love it but i have had no enjoyment playing it at all
Minit,"Cyberpunk is one of my all-time favourites, but Red Dead II is objectively the GOAT"
Minit,RDR 2 and don't think twice. Cyberpunk is good but RDR2 is a masterpiece and goated.
Minit,"I haven't played Cyberpunk yet, but RDR2 is a must play. I held off on playing RDR2 for a long time, due to people saying its slow paced. That was a mistake. I didn't feel slow to me, because the story is so good. If it was a movie, it would get an Oscar."
Minit,Rdr2 first and then cyberpunk
Minit,RDR2 no contest
Minit,RDR2 is at minimum a top 10 all time must play game
Minit,Red dead is wayyyy better than cyber.
Minit,"10/10 ""wild west"" (kind of) open world with a 10/10 story or a, well, cyberpunk open world with a 9,5/10 story


your call"
Minit,"Rdr2 is amazing. Cyberpunk is great and one of the better open world games I've played ever. I've played a lot of games and I adore this game. Wasn't perfect obviously with the console bugs but it's still great. If you're on pc then get it,next gen consoles then yeah. Previous gen then definitely no. 

After playing both, I can say both are great and damn good games. RDR2 is a masterpiece and Cyberpunk could one day end up being remembered as one. If not for the bugs and launch issues then kt would've been perfect imo"

Minit,"Cyberpunk is one of the more fun games I've played in years.  Red dead redemption 2 is the single greatest game I've ever played. Play both, but start with red dead."
Minit,How much is rdr2? I just bought it for $70? 😭😭😭😭
Minit,Anyone who is a gamer must play RDR2
Minit,Cyberpunk. That's just me though. This is really a question you need to ask yourself.
Minit,"Well I would say both, but I would suggest leaving cyberpunk aside until Phantom Liberty comes out and you can experience it at its highest. So for now, I recommend Red Dead. It's very fun, finished it recently, couldn't put my controller down, one week of my holiday gone, spent 110 hours on the game. Just don't overwhelm yourself and don't rush too much with the story, just enjoy the game's atmosphere and its randomness and progress in the story in whatever way feels best to you.

If you worry about completionism, I recommend making a manual save for everytime you start a new chapter."
Minit,Cyberpunk has finally gotten out of the shadow of its launch and is finally the game it was promised to be. But RDR 2 would be Rockstar’s masterpiece if the first game and GTA V didn’t already exist. Definitely check both games out but give Red Dead Redemption 2 a try first.
Minit,I liked Cyberpunk a lot but RDR2 is the way to go
Minit,Cyberpunk only because it going to get a overhaul that makes the game worth playing but red dead 2 is hella fun as well so wouldn't blame you if you got that over it since cyberpunk started off bad and kept people off it.
Minit,RDR2. It has an amazing story.
Minit,I haven't played Cyberpunk but RDR2 is such a masterpiece so that's my vote :)
Minit,Red Dead Redemption is a masterpiece. Cyberpunk in its current state is fine but nowhere near RDR2 level.
Minit,RDR2
Minit,"I played both, and 110% would pick RDR2 over cyberpunk. I think I’ve replayed it 4 times now. Played through Cyberpunk once and haven’t felt much like going back. Just a richer story in RDR2."
Minit,"i know everyone and their mom has already said it in this comment section, but i’m gonna add my voice to the choir anyways: rdr2 first, without a doubt."
Minit,RDR2 is great. would never spend money on cyberjunk
Minit,Rdr2 is slow as fuck cyberpunk is fast paced so i would go for cyberpunk (haven't been a fan of slow paced walking and riding Sims no matter how good the story is if they can't give it to me in a faster manner or keep me retained i ain't bout that)
Minit,RDR 2
Minit,"Wow, someone needs to rep cyberpunk here.  I loved it.  Best game of last 5 years for me.

Rdr2 was boring for me.  Scenery was pretty and all but I just found it repetitive.  Ride horse, shoot, do boring camp stuff, etc.  I dunno I like doing that stuff in real life.  

Cyberpunk is just super fun.  The soundtrack bangs.. you get swords implanted in your arms... the lore is super interesting.. lots of meaningful choices.  It's the only game I've ever replayed 

CP got a bad rap at launch.  I get it.  But on PS5 today it rocks"
Minit,"Cyberpunk will have a GOTY edition either with Phantom Liberty’s release or shortly thereafter. Acquiring RDR2 right now makes more sense, at least to me."
Minit,Buy rdr2 and when cyberpunk gets a complete edition buy that one later on
Minit,Both are incredible. I would not recommend getting Cyberpunk on a PS4 as it just stops working for me after like an hour of play time. RDR2 is a considerably better game but both are worth it
Minit,"Play RDR, then go to the second one - you won't regret it."
Minit,"I'm playing Cyberpunk rn and while id say it is a very good game and looks incredible, it is still nowhere near as polished as RDR2, combat, movement, interactions, npcs, customization and most of the things that make an open world/exploration game good are better in RDR2 in my opinion. But id still recommend you to get Cyberpunk later, it is a great game."
Minit,"Red dead 2, Cyberpunk isn't bad now, but RDR2 still has a good case for being the best game of all time."
Minit,I would get RDR2 first. Its long game with a much better story imo. Plus cyberpunk is getting that expansion in a few months that'll be overhauling some gameplay mechanics.
Minit,Cyberpunk.
Minit,"Red dead’s storymode is god tier, online can be amazing, Cyberpunk is very good, Perosnally I’d say red dead if you’ll play the online, cyberpunk if ur not gonna play the online"
Minit,"I say it depends on your system. I have a PS4 slim and cyberpunk is unplayable after the last large update. Gonna have to get a ps5 to actually play it. Could be my save corrupted somehow, but the game freezes after 20 minutes almost religiously."
Minit,RDR2 is one the best video games ever made. Definitely go for that first.
Minit,RDR2 any day of the week.
Minit,"Play RDR2 first and then buy Cyberpunk when the new expansion drops. I love both games, but it sounds like CP2077: Phantom Liberty will be the definitive edition"
Minit,"I would recommend both, but you need to play RDR2 if you haven't first"
Minit,Red dead redemption 2 a million times over cyberpunk
Minit,"RDR2, absolutely."
Minit,"I think cyberpunk and the expansion are on sale right now. But I’d go for rdr2 first considering it will be more instant gratification then having to wait till December for the expansion on cyberpunk, which will have a ton of new content meant to make the experience way better."
Minit,"Cyberpunk is poorly written, rdr2 is a masterclass"
Minit,RDR2 by a mile
Minit,"I played both games this year. I haven't finished Cyberpunk yet but it's pretty fun, I love everything about it except for some game breaking bugs and funny braindead AI. Both games are great but RDR2 is a triump; storytelling, characters, sound design, voice acting and impressive life-like world with a lot of details and hidden gems in it although gameplay is your standard Rockstar game, it's still an immersive game."
Minit,"I would recommend that you never buy cyberpunk and if Red dead is your thing, go for it. (It’s not my thing. But seriously, don’t buy cyberpunk.)"
Minit,Definitely Red Dead Redemption 2. Best game i have ever played since 2006
Minit,"huge cyberpunk fan here, i'd probably buy it when phantom liberty comes out since they're overhauling everything. RDR2 however was a masterpiece when it came out. definitely grab it, especially if on sale"
Minit,RDR2 will make you question if any game you ever played was good at all.
Minit,"Fair warning. I also say RDR2, BUT you need to go into it realizing it IS intentionally slower paced. Take your time with it, really invest in the characters and just hang out in the world, exploring and such. However, that said, I absolutely LOVE RDR2. It’s my favorite of all time."
Minit,Rdr2
Minit,"Both are really good 

I really enjoyed RDR2 a lot but Cyberpunk has something that really made me love it. 

I don't know if it's the setting or the overall dystopian world but it's a really great experience now

Plus Phantom Liberty is coming in september I believe so it might be worth a try"
Minit,"Both are on par and considered masterpieces of their own, CP story is more complex and fast paced while RDR2 is more of a slow burn kind of story. I think that CP is the superior game but I think you should buy both."
Minit,"Imo RDR2 is superior in essentially every aspect, I would definitely try it out."
Minit,Get both
Minit,"Definitely RDR2, seriously it contains the best protagonist you’ll ever play."
Minit,"Red dead is a must - cyberpunk is a should, so play RDR 2 first, then when the DLC is out pick up cyberpunk"
Minit,RDR2. I played both but for me RDR2 is just better.
Minit,"RDR2 barring it’s online is easily one of the best games ever made in my opinion. Same goes for RDR1, which can be played in either order. On top of that there’s undead nightmare as an added plus"
Minit,"I love both. But if I had to choose, it would be RDR2"
Minit,"Honestly both are really great games, you should pick based on what type of world you would like to dive into. Dystopian future, vs movie western."
Minit,Rdr2 killed my parents. We’re happily married now.
Minit,"RDR2 for sure!!!! I'm playing it again right now. Easily in my top 10 greatest games of all time. And with the amount of games I've played over 30+ years, that is really saying something."
Minit,Honestly they are both amazing In their own rights. RDR2 is considered one of the best games of all time tho so it’s an easy pick
Minit,"Obvious answer is rdr 2 first, but let me say this. No open world game will ever be the same after rdr2. Its miles ahead any game ive played to this day, technically and story wise."
Minit,"Both games are amazing. You can't go wrong with either - great storyline, great side quests, you can just dig yourself in for hours and hours. I'd highly recommend both. But if I had to pick one, I'd say RDR2. It left a bigger impression on me after finishing it."
Minit,"RDR2 is probably the better game from a technical standpoint, but I found the controls kind of kludgy to be honest.  I beat it once and have never felt the desire to replay it.

Cyberpunk on the other hand is the kind of game I can beat then immediately want to start a new character.  Yeah, it's undoubtably not as polished, but I just had more fun with it.  (Again, a big part of this probably just comes back to the controls, which were a lot smoother in Cyberpunk.)

Honestly...  You should just  get them BOTH!"
Minit,Rdr2 is easily the greatest console game ever made
Minit,"They’re very different games which is something to bare in mind. However, RDR2 is a much more polished product. I’d play that first and then pick up 2077/Phantom Liberty because they have basically said that the entire game is getting overhauled and polished with the next update/DLC in September. Both games will grip you emotionally as they’re very well written"
Minit,I played through cyberpunk twice. I stopped playing RDR2 when I got bored of riding my horsey.
Minit,Cyberpunk. Honestly RDR2 kind of bored me
Minit,And I will play it. Thanks for the reply.
Minit,Yeah what else is there to say? Although Cyberpunk is very enjoyable
Minit,I would say portal is a triumph.
Minit,"Sure, I guess then RDR2 it is. Thanks for the reply."
Minit,I won't pass on either but I guess first I will go through RDR2. Thanks for the reply.
Minit,I didn't feel the same. What is so unmissable about red dead for you?
Minit,To be honest it really depends. Personally I felt Red dead was a little to realistic for me and Cyber punk was more actiony.
Minit,">It will give you a thrill, make you feel like a badass, and then leave you in tears.

beautifully said."
Minit,Yes.
Minit,Same here it's hard to get into other games since I've played rdr2 I keep going back to it.
Minit,"Yeah, I guess waiting for the new update and dlc is the best option as new things will be added along with overhauls. Thanks for the reply."
Minit,What kind of depth does rdr2 have?
Minit,"Yeah. I just saw the dlc as pre-order along with Cyberpunk, but I think it will not be a great idea to buy it as they are adding and overhauling some features of the game in the next update probably. I guess waiting atleast till the update will be the right choice. Thanks for the reply."
Minit,I’ve just started the game is it best to wait for the DLC then and when does it drop ?
Minit,Phantom Pain is Metal Gear Solid. Cyberpunk 2077's expansion is called Phantom Liberty.
Minit,Do you know if ultimate version of RDR2 is worth it?
Minit,Any other game similar to rdr2 in gameplay? I love the sort of chill vibes with the option of action.
Minit,Careful it's CP2077
Minit,"Just a minor note that the outfit issue was fixed with a transmog function, so now you can play dress up and not just worry about stats.  But if you want to see your own outfit you have to drive a motorcycle."
Minit,Should I finish cyberpunk before the dlc?
Minit,"Yeah same here, RDR2 was amazing but I was way more immersed in Cyberpunk's world than RDR2's one 

Though both are really great games and should be played imo"
Minit,"Sorry to bother, but I would also like to ask which edition of RDR2 should I get. I will tell beforehand that I don't think I will be playing online version of the game."
Minit,I think most people agree that RDR2’s story is great and the strongest part of the game besides the visuals.
Minit,"Bruh. Who has the audacity to say RDR2 doesn’t have a good story?

It’s been widely, widely lauded as having one of the best stories in recent years"
Minit,"Thanks. I think story is subjective so might really like RDR2 too as I am not a huge fan of futuristic world. Though I am not a huge fan of Cowboys either (mediaeval fan here), though I might like it if I play it. Thanks for replying, I might get RDR2 now and wait for the update and expansion of Cyberpunk."
Minit,"I don't know about the story, but the best video game character is BT-7274. Period."
Minit,"This is how I feel. Cyberpunk was faster paced and I got more immediate gratification. I actually still haven’t gotten very far in RDR2 just because it has been slower-paced, but that being said, it is an exceptionally well-designed game"
Minit,"You’ve just described my exact experience. I really enjoyed RDR2 but we had just had our first baby when the it released - I just didn’t have the time and it fell by the wayside as a result, so I never finished it. Cyberpunk I managed to complete several times over on PS4 Pro and one more on PS5. Every single play through I’ve played completely differently to the last. It’s been immense. The sheer variety on offer with the story and the play styles means totally different experiences each time. While Red Dead is a beautiful and epic experience - it’s a fairly unilateral one. The only real variety coming from how many side missions or how much peripheral content you want to pursue. My wife played Cyberpunk more than I did - her sessions were vastly different to mine. I haven’t seen anything quite like it since the likes of Elder Scrolls."
Minit,“HANK! DON’T ABBREVIATE CYBERPUNK LIKE THAT! HAAAAANK!”
Minit,Not really. Where is the single player content?
Minit,"Same is experience. RDR2 more polished and you interact with more things, and NPC has better reactions. But cyberpunk is just more fun to play.

My biggest issue with rockstar games is that on rails and very linear. That’s being said they still quality games and will buying the next Rockstar game when it comes out."
Minit,You can always turn off aim assist for a better challenge in RDR2
Minit,What do you mean by terrible gameplay in RDR2?
Minit,"Yeah, just saw the amount of things they are adding in the update and expansion. Some of it is overhaul of current systems so I guess waiting for the update and the dlc is the best thing for now. Anyways, I would like to ask one more thing, should I buy RDR2 on Epic store or Steam because as far as I have heard, Epic store has a really bad mod support for games. And I guess there some fine mods for RDR2 so would like to get my hands on them. Thanks."
Minit,"> game i *paid* for. So

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*"
Minit,"I played the game about a year ago and only experienced like 5 bugs, none of them even being close to game breaking"
Minit,I bought and played a month or so ago and experienced almost 0 bugs. I think one quest messed up and that was it. After the most recent patch it seems pretty good. Also looks amazing with the ray tracing.
Minit,">the janky controls are super frustrating and honestly it’s pretty slow at times. I don’t need to watch long animations every time I pick something up or do anything. It’s more cowboy sim than game.  
>  
>Tried it 3 times and never make it past 10 hrs or so.

Not every game is made for you."
Minit,you think cyberpunk is a fail because of first week youtube videos and headlines. mostly everyone that plays the game says it is on track to becoming a no man's sky type revive
Minit,Cyberpunk absolutely does not have better writing…
Minit,no reason to skip one of the greatest games of this generation
Minit,"How is it overrated, there’s no game that has that level of detail, i can understand not enjoying the slow paced gameplay, but you can’t deny that no game has pushed the boundaries of open world like red dead in terms of immersion."
Minit,sure buddy go play ludo
Minit,You're getting hate but it's true. RD2 felt more like an interactive movie than a game.
Minit,"For reference, I have played both and love both, I even lean towards rdr2, but I am recommending based on OP's interests, unlike most of you"

Minit,I’ll be honest I thought RDR2 was a tedious piece of trash and nothing like the first game. Cyberpunk   Is more fun and you’ll want to play it more.
Minit,"Cyberpunk is getting a big expansion in September, along with a huge update that overhauls the whole game pretty much. Definitely hit RDR first and then grab cyberpunk after the update sometime."
Minit,Great story.  Great gameplay.  Great experience overall.
Minit,"I think it has some serious flaws but most of those flaws are in line with the vision of the game rather than being oversights. Like all the animations and forced walk sections, or the controls not being very arcadey with no jump button. The main flaw that defies this rule is the absurdly on-the-rails quests, which are typical for Rockstar.

All of that being said, it was in many ways a masterwork. Unparalleled attention to detail. Felt great to explore and discover. Could sink absurd hours into it or just pick up and play, and either way is fun. I find myself coming back to it all the time and finding things I missed.

It was imo the first Open World to feature both breadth and depth in world design without being riddled with bugs. You can tell the crunch went into perfecting the details rather than throwing the game together.

Gameplay and story not revolutionary but consistently solid."
Minit,It’s an absolute masterpiece.
Minit,"I've played and beaten both, and I love both games. That being said RDR2 is a fucking masterpiece. I don't know any game I'd pick over rdr2 in a one on one."
Minit,"It's probably the deepest and most fully realized open world ever crafted, filled with rich and compelling characters, emergent choices, and awesome things to discover. It's held up by many experts as one of the iconic examples of video games as art. But go off, chief. Contrarianism is all the rage."
Minit,"It would be easier to list what components of RDR2 *do not* have depth:

Enemies - it's all pew pew guys across the board.

Mounts - it's all horses across the board.

As for narrative, gameplay, world building, world interaction, customization, side missions, character developments, npc interactions, etc. etc. etc., I could go on but I've given your clearly catty, insincere comment enough effort and time, maybe just become more interesting in the future and open up with a compelling point next time."
Minit,September 26.
Minit,Haha very true that was a Freudian slip!
Minit,"If you can get it cheap then maybe but I don't think it's worth it, personally."
Minit,Rdr1 is the only one I can think of
Minit,GTA
Minit,Death Stranding I suppose both tedious games but are top 3 for me
Minit,Oh that’s good to know. And thanks for the correction
Minit,No they plan to overhaul the ai and make other changes. (Better Skill tree for example)
Minit,"In which case, the cheapest version. The ultimate edition just has online content iirc"
Minit,"Is the story really good or are the characters just carrying everything? Playing rn and the story is kind of meh. Rockstar games never really had a great main story, but that is not necessary with all the fun.

Not saying I'm right, just how I am feeling right now."
Minit,[deleted]
Minit,"Many actually. And even as a huge fan myself, I understand that the pacing of that story is all over the place and many of my friends drop it after initial 2-3 snowy hours and I keep on trying to convince them."
Minit,"When I was contemplating rdr2 I felt like you. I also was unsure about the horse riding mechanic, as I was used to GTA and using vehicles. And I was unsure I would enjoy the 1899 setting. But let me tell you, get this game! It’s so good. You will end up being fascinated with the world, including the horse riding."
Minit,"I've tried to get into RDR2 multiple times, I really appreciate the quality and complexity of the game, but I just can't, because I find the entire cowboy setting to be boring and uninteresting."
Minit,"The game was so good and complete at release, it didn’t need it."
Minit,"There's a reason why they made auto aim the default in RDR2, because the combat is so clunky that it needs it"
Minit,It’s a very boring gameplay that’s for sure.
Minit,Mainly because the mission design and combat are so bad
Minit,"I play on PS5, so I wouldn't know much about epic store vs steam. Maybe try asking on the Red Dead sub, they will probably give better answers than I could"
Minit,You can mod pretty much everygame on steam just as well if not better than epic. Some games even have steam cumunity mods through the steam store such as l4d2. Really the only reason id choose epic over steam for anything is if epic is giving a game away for free and even them there are some cases where id still just rather buy it from steam.
Minit,Good bot
Minit,The freind i borrowed it from said the same thing so i guess it varied from person to person. My experience was a mess. Nothing game breaking in the sense that i couldn't progress but a lot of religing becouse i got stuck in terminals and uis. Also had this one where jackie always had his gun out no matter what animtion he was doing or where he was. Even had it on that mission where we coukdnt bring our guns. Nothing could have been done to fix that one just had to accept that that was jakie now for that playthrough
Minit,"Im with this guy, never had any game breaking bugs in this game from day 1. Playing PC with a good gpu over on my end tho. If youve got a 30 series gpu or newer cyberpunk runs literally fine"
Minit,Yeah thats one thing i can personally attest to it looks really good. Also it supports dlss 3 fram generation so it runs really smooth a 4000 series card.
Minit,"This is a stupid fucking reply

Nowhere did they say that. They're allowed to criticise the controls of a game when someone asks for opinions on that game. Opinions from both sides are important when deciding whether to buy something or not."
Minit,Never said it was.
Minit,It's widely agreed the controls and combat are super clunky.
Minit,"Opinions are opinions my dude, both games had amazing writing but I felt more connected to Cyberpunk."
Minit,Guess the opinions are divided. I didn't like rdr2's writing very much. What was so great about it then?
Minit,I agree about the level of detail. For sure it's impressive in that aspect. It's just soooo fucking slooow man. I almost didn't finish that game considering how tedious it was. I'm sorry.
Minit,Ok
Minit,"Tedious as f... imo. I almost didn't finish it, but the story got me through. Gameplay was the worst!"
Minit,"Weird, I was raised by fast paced shooters and such and absolutely adored rdr2 despite its slower nature."
Minit,"Want to cook some food? 10 minute animation per piece cooked. Want to loot something? 10 minute animation of you picking the body up. Want to skin an animal? 45 minute animation. Oh, and btw, you need hundreds of pelts if you want to do side content. It is the most ridiculous shit.

Everyone kept telling me I needed to get to chapter 2 to really get a feel for the game. I made it past chapter 2 and I still hate the game. Only now I'm past my refund window and hate it even more now.

Every mission is you riding with some member of your crew on horseback for 45 minutes while you get gigantic exposition dumps. RDR2 is the game you get when you distill the WORST parts of the GTA franchise down into a cowboy game.

This was the first game that was universally praised, in a genre I love, that I hated to it's core. It has me questioning whether or not i should even bother buying the last of us on PC."
Minit,Where are details on the huge update? Can’t seem to find any but very interested
Minit,Still playing cyberpunk on a console like ps5 is like playing in a ghost town. If OP has a decent rig he should definitely hit cyberpunk in September.
Minit,"Wasn't this supposed to come out this month? I am very excited about the DLC, but I'll believe the release date once I've downloaded it."
Minit,"Will they completely drop their sad excuse for an armor system, their sad excuse for a weapon system, and their sad excuse for a perk system? Oh wait… that’s like every system in the damn game. Would be silly to ask for that.

Edit: holy shit it looks like they are!"
Minit,"I thought it was very visually impressive and well acted. Also the soundtrack fucking slaps. I love the soundtrack. It also usually managed to capture the intended vibe very well. But it wasn't very thought-provoking. And some of the side content just completely misses the mark. 

Cyberpunk is a lot less polished and pleasant. But some of the sidequests could have carried entire high-quality indiegames."
Minit,"Trailing missions, long ass point a to point b travel, goofy ah shooting, extremely linear missions, breaking the games economy with that stage coach robbery mission. Can’t deny the flaws."
Minit,Did not know a simple question was a clearly catty insincere comment....
Minit,"Lol what a pathetically insecure reply. RDR2 has absolutely zero depth when it comes to gameplay, mission structure, level design, or npc interactions. It’s all shallow set dressing for a pretty decent story that would’ve worked better as a TV series. As an actual videogame, it’s average at best."
Minit,"> I've given your clearly catty, insincere comment enough effort and time, maybe just become more interesting in the future and open up with a compelling point next time.

You’re right - how dare he ask a simple question about your favourite game?! The audacity of /u/ihave0idea0 knows no limits! 

Personally I find RDR2 wholly unappealing to me, mostly because what I’ve seen of the combat mechanics seems quite repetitive and more importantly not skill-based.  
But I also don’t like the Elder Scrolls series or Cyberpunk for the same reason, so this thread just isn’t for me."
Minit,"Yeah, been through that. And online doesn't do it for me"
Minit,I actually have that. Might give it a try
Minit,Oh I’ll wait then damn okay thanks.
Minit,Thank you very much.
Minit,"It’s definitely more character driven than plot driven. It might take a while for the story to get going, but when it does, it’s really some of the best dramatic writing I’ve ever seen in anything. It’s worth sticking with for sure."
Minit,"… that’s what a story is, a journey of characters through an arc. The plot of 99% of stories is the same basic shit."
Minit,"Fair, I can’t seem to get into Witcher 3, despite being a huge fan of the lore and gameplay.

It just… feels so huge and cumbersome"
Minit,Yeah the story feels very disjointed. You do like 5 completely unrelated main story missions and then eventually come across another mission that advances the story. How’s that a great story? I get that people like those unrelated main missions since they like long games and are willing to tolerate a somewhat disjointed story if it means a longer game. But you can’t tell me that’s a good story. A good story must have a good flow.
Minit,Rdr2 is easily top 5 of last gen
Minit,"Yeah it's not even gameplay.
Just high quality movie"
Minit,Tried that but didn't get any answer. Other modding subreddits had no idea either. I guess I will try asking there again. Thank you very much.
Minit,"Actually had a coupon on epic store, so wouldn't want it to go to waste. I have some other the list but would live to know if epic store version can be modded. The RDR2 subreddit seems kinda dead with most of the posts with no replies so I think I might not get one there either."
Minit,Best bot
Minit,">This is a stupid fucking reply

Exactly my thoughts lol.

I absolutely loved RDR2 but I can totally see how it can be boring for some people. In fact, I've seen plenty of comments on various subs saying exactly that, so I think it's important thing to highlight for OP."
Minit,"It was cool at first but then I just got tired of it quick. I also work 50hrs a week with like 1 hour commute one way so I just don’t have time for slow games anymore. 
That being said getting off a horse just to pick something up every time is just an awful game play design."
Minit,What a debby downer you are. Pessimistic much? Lol
Minit,Valid
Minit,"[Check it](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/147domj/everything_new_with_phantom_liberty_and_patch_17/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)

I’m pretty excited"
Minit,It says September 26th on steam. Even if you don't get the DLC you still get access to the massive overhaul btw.
Minit,I think the side content is amazing. Maybe some things could be better but it is very good
Minit,"Yeah I get that but thought provoking is not what I expect from Rockstar, or any game outside of select RPGs.

It’s more like a great execution of a tried and true formula. If I wanted a thought provoking Western, I’d reread Blood Meridian, not play an open world game."
Minit,There’s nothing thought provoking about Cyperpunk either
Minit,They’re not flaws…  They’re features!
Minit,Yeah rockstar hasn't improved it's gameplay since GTA San Andreas. It's a shame because visually and story wise the games are brilliant
Minit,"It's not a simple question, it's probably the most highly praised game of the last decade, pretending that you know nothing about it whatsoever and have decided to randomly come to me to learn more about it is naive and stupid at best."
Minit,"And this is the kind of dumbass mentality that went behind asking 'hurr, what kind of depth rdr2 got?'"
Minit,"The OP asked which game should he play, not your emotional personal take that doesn’t help at all and literally NO ONE cares about"
Minit,I hear you. Just the most similar gameplay I could think of. Basically the same game at a different time period with different technology.
Minit,"Story wise, propably. Gameplay, definetly not."
Minit,I dont see why not you wouldnt be able too. Modding alters your local files on your system so i feel like whichever store front you bought it from wouldnt matter. All the games ive ever modded were on steam but i never had to actually interact with steam to do it so i feel like the same processes would have worked even if i bought them from epic.
Minit,"Fair enough, that horse thing is true"
Minit,"Everyone I know loves this game. So I never criticize it around them, because I would feel like a debbie downer. It was just exciting to finally see someone else hate it."
Minit,Everything he said is valid and he’s entitled to his opinion. That isn’t pessimism
Minit,"The shredder of panda guy I’m replying to blocked  me, then reported me to Reddit for some kinda wellness check?? People are so weird.. wtf"
Minit,"Thank you. 

Man I am hype now."
Minit,I'm happy for you. That I didn't feel the same doesn't mean I want to take that away from you
Minit,"I don't think thought provoking was something they were not trying to do. The story of the main characters in what is essentially a cult was compelling but just not for that long. 

Also looking at cyberpunk again. I think there are plenty of moments there that could be labeled thought provoking. 

Maybe I just wanted the wrong things from the game."
Minit,"No? What about Joshua's quest line? Rivers quest line? The quests with the mayor and his wife? V's story, the different endings. Even the quest with the vending machine ends up asking some interesting questions."
Minit,Let’s hope for gta 6 I personally didn’t like rdr2 as much as other people did for personal reasons but I still thought it was a fantastic game
Minit,"Damn, you even double-downed on it.

People ARE allowed to not know everything about RDR2, man.

You clearly spend a lot of time thinking about your favourite video games - that’s fine, but you should realise that other people may have other interests and may actually not know much about it, if at all.

As I said I personally find the gameplay uninteresting (not sure how you can think it has a lot of depth, tbh) - and a game without good gameplay is just a bad game to me. Therefore I have little interest in Rockstar games in general, because their gameplay is usually super casual-oriented.

As for the rest of you description of the depth of the game, you used a bunch of buzz-words but didn’t actually explaining anything to the guy.

Good graphics, good story, world building, character development and voice acting are great, but if that’s all there is to it, I’d rather watch a movie or read a book tbh. Gameplay is where games are at for me, and a lot of people in general."
Minit,"Did you mean to reply to someone else?

How am I the emotional one for replying to someone having a complete meltdown at the mère idea that someone didn’t know the alleged qualities of RDR2?

I explained why I thought that neither games thought of by OP were particularly good in my opinion. That’s very relevant to the discussion.

What’s the point of your needlessly aggressive comment that no one asked for and no one cares about, to use your own words?"
Minit,Exactly. However I think my emotional investment was larger in rdr2. But time period doesn't really matter.
Minit,"Thanks for the reply. Just wanted to make sure. Actually, I heard and experienced issues with modding, especially with Bethesda games in Epic Games Store. And in general have heard people saying that Epic store is pretty bad if someone wants to play with mods. Modding for me is one of the main and most fun things (especially in games like Skyrim) so sometimes no excess to mods can be a huge deal breaker for me."
Minit,"""10 minute animation. 45 minute animation"". Yeah sure  that's real valid isn't it lol. Someone being overly negative and blowing something out of proportion is considered to be pessimistic to me. I never said he was wrong and couldn't have an opinion. I just called him a debby downer. I'm entitled to my opinion as well right?"
Minit,"Hey, what didn’t you like about the side content? I guess hunting is kinda barebones"
Minit,"Rivers quest was so boring. Go here, fetch this. Fetch that. Search the nephews room for clues. Snooze fest. It was nothing I haven’t seen before a million times. Most of the side quests were boring as hell. There were some cool moments, but thought provoking? Nah."
Minit,"Don't care, didn't read; get more interesting and stop leaning on sarcasm as a crutch for your lack of personality."
Minit,Continue with your non contributions. Op asked which game and here you are just wasting thread space
Minit,If you want to rant about how terrible RDR2 is make your own post
Minit,"Your making comments on someone’s character over a game, if anything you’re a Debby downer"
Minit,"Some of the sidequests were kinda stupid and unsatisfying. The one that stuck in my mind the most was the one where you encounter that woman who takes advantage of two guys with disabilities and the ark of the story is that the guys don't want to be with her because she's an absolutely horrible, abusive human being. Then when you find them they realise that they're still gonna go with her. 

Like what's the point? I had no input, the ark of the characters was to learn to put up with an abuser and it took like 20 minutes. 

&#x200B;

Not to say that I encountered no good sidequests. The one where you help a woman learn to live in the forest was lovely. But the game to me was littered with moments that ended in an unsatisfying anticlimax."
Minit,"Very interesting. What did you think of >!
Jackies funeral? !<"
Minit,"That comes from the guy that screeched and had a complete meltdown when someone else dared ask which kind of depth RDR2 had, because how dare he not know your favourite video game.

There is 0 irony in my last comment, btw! Not that I would expect you to understand irony…

Lmfao, reddit basement-dweller moment."
Minit,"What’s YOUR contribution, lad? What’s your purpose? Why are you commenting?

As I said above, I explained why I thought neither of the games were particularly good in my opinion. That’s highly relèvent on a sub where people ask whether they should buy specific games.

My comment is on topic. Yours aren’t and are just useless attacks with 0 contribution on the actual subject. Are you perhaps an alt of the other guy? That’s the o my way this would make sense, tbh. You’re weird"
Minit,"Ranting? For a whole 2 lines? Do you even know what a rant is? Open a dictionary ffs

The guy above had a meltdown when someone asked a simple question, I pointed out to him that no everyone necessarily liked every game or knew everything about every game.

That’s highly relevant to the conversation.

Once again, what is YOUR contribution here, apart from attacking me for no reason?"
Minit,You're making comments about my character over a reddit post. A bit hypocritical.
Minit,"Well, I didn't realize they had disabilities. Maybe I'm just stupid. I'm guessing your talking about the one where you had to keep punching and kicking those guys to prove which one was stronger? 

I saw it as funny, and I never saw them go back to her, I don't think I ever saw them after their final mission.  


Maybe I just didn't find them or I'm stupid. Oh well, I enjoyed those missions, and yeah that one with charlotte (woman in forest) was great."
Minit,Getting his bike was the best part
Minit,"No, you were in fact, weird because no one cares what you don’t like. I was genuinely interested in seeing how much people loved one game over the other but here you are."
Minit,I already gave my contribution
Minit,"My contribution was that I love both games but I feel like RDR two gets the one here because not only is it one of the greatest games of all time, but the story is pretty impactful"
Minit,My context might seem illiterate because I am using voice to text
Minit,"I think we're talking about another quest.  I googled it, it's called ""the smell of grease paint""."
Minit,"Intruiging. I absolutely love that quest for how real it feels. 
>! How it takes the time to mourn and speak to the people that this affected. Presenting a death so realistically gave so much validity to the rest of the world. It made me remember times I've lost people. 
Death in video games is never presented like this. !<"
Minit,"That sounds like a you issue, tbh

- Some people love one game more than the other

- some people prefer the other one

- some people like neither of them

These are all valid opinions on the exact same subject. I’m in the third camp, for reasons that I explained. I would therefore recommend OP to buy neither of these games if the reasons I gave resonate with him.

It’s hilarious that you don’t see that my comment is very much on topic for this thread - logic isn’t your forte, huh"
Minit,"Clearly not in this chain of comment, which is why I’m asking you what you’re even doing here."
Minit,"Fair enough! That’s understandable.

My contribution was that I didn’t like either of them for the reason stated above (gameplay isn’t interesting or skill-based enough, and that’s what matters most in games in my opinion), and therefore wouldn’t recommend either of them.

Don’t you see how my opinion is just as valid as yours? Again, why are you commenting here?"
The Witness,"the witness has alot to do with environmental puzzles such as listening to a sound sequence, looking through a certain area, it's really fun. I recommend watching the first video of the witness by aliensrock just to get a feel for what kind of game it is. it does spoil some puzzles though"
The Witness,"It has neat twists, but at its core it is a shit ton of panel line puzzles.  Kinda like Layton except the puzzles are way more one note and there is no story.  Check out a vid first to see if that can hold your interest.  I didn't finish it."
The Witness,"It’s one of the game I got for free everywhere at some point (twitch? epic and Xbox). Enjoyed playing it a lot, it was one of the few games my daughter wasn’t scared to look at. But got stuck somewhere and quit, it doesn’t have the pull factor flying get me back."
The Forgotten City,"I think they are both eligible for the Nintendo vouchers, so you could get both for $100."
The Forgotten City,I haven't played the reboot yet but I personally love Advance Wars and would highly recommend it. It's also a pretty accessible game for those who aren't too familiar with tactics games from what I remember.
The Forgotten City,"Personally, I like to switch genres between games, so because you just beat Tropical Freeze, I’d go with Advance Wars next, since Kirby is another platformer"
The Forgotten City,"Kirby is such a chill game. It is beautiful and fun but light on challenge. So if you want some vibes, Kirby."
The Forgotten City,"Over the shoulder, the title looked like it said

>Advanced wars on Kirby

And I quickly scrolled up like ""omg what happened?"""
The Forgotten City,"I would ask you, have you played Mario Odyssey and Fire Emblem Three Houses?

If you have, which one have you enjoyed more?

If you've enjoyed Odyssey more, then go with Kirby, if you've enjoyed Fire Emblem more, then go with Advance Wars."
The Forgotten City,"I'm currently playing advance wars and I'm really enjoying it, especially since I haven't actually played the first 2 games and didn't get into the series until Dual Strike. So far it's doing a great job of easing me into the ebb and flow of battles and pointing out potential strategies. I'm about 30% into the campaign of the first game and it seems like there's a lot to unlock as you play. You can't play the second game off the bat and it seems like it might not unlock until you beat the 1st campaign, but I won't know until I actually unlock it.

I haven't played Kirby yet but I've been meaning to ever since my partner got it, so I can't compare."
Dead Cells,"They are both such different experiences. For me Sekiro is better. But it depends what you are after. If you really enjoyed the die and progress elements of Hades, dead cells will probably click. Sekiro is more of a ""you need to learn the mechanics to get better"" kind of game so not really comparable."
Dead Cells,"If you look for it you will be shocked at how cheap you can find Sekiro on disc. I found it 2nd hand for under $10 , as for Dead Cells I think digital is the only way-as far as I know. 

Personally I loved my time with Sekiro and wish I could experience it again for the first time."
Dead Cells,"Thanks, Where did you get it for 10?"
Dead Cells,Well I got it from a franchise pawn shop called Cash Converters popular in South Africa. If you have any second hand/pawn shops around you I would highly recommend a scavenge. You wouldn't believe the gems you find for cheap.
Crypt of the Necrodancer,[deleted]
Crypt of the Necrodancer,"Ah, ok. Thank you!"
Hotline Miami,If you have xbox one My Friend Pedro is free with Game Pass.
Hotline Miami,"Aw man, this is a hard decision. Love both game to death, but if you want more replayability it would be my friend Pedro."
Hotline Miami,"I didn't play Hotline Miami, but i can say that My Friend Pedro is a very replayable game and it's fun. It's too short though"
Hotline Miami,Bro I didn't even know My Friend Pedro was even on Xbox
Hotline Miami,"Just stumbled upon this old comment by accident and completely changed my mind. For anyone finding this in tje future, both Hotline Miami games are infinitely better than My Friend Pedro. If you want more blood-fueled action after playing Hotline Miami, buy My Friend Pedro."
Sword & Sworcery EP,"First of all - thank your for your extensive recommendation.

I've bought the game as a part of Humble Bundle and I was quite looking forward to it since I consider myself quite open to ""different"" games which are all about experience. I admit, I've only completed the first chapter but I was quite disappointed and found no reason to play it again.

Nonetheless, thank you for your opinion; I will probably try the Android version which could be more suitable in my case."
Sword & Sworcery EP,"I'm going to have to disagree. I thought this game was pretty bad. Slow paced, terrible ""combat"", boring, the soundtrack isn't even that good (more enjoyment from the music in Hotline: Miami). The final straw was when I got halfway through after putting myself through the pain that was playing this game and then I found out you have to wait until the next cycle of the moon to continue. Fuck. That. 

If you enjoyed it more power to you but I would definitely give this game a YSNB rating and even if it was bundled with something to forget you have it. There are much better games to play on pc and if you have it on mobile read instead - reading is good for you. 

2/10"
Sword & Sworcery EP,"I'm going to have to add my voice to the other dissenting opinions. Maybe it plays better on touchscreen devices, but on PC, I found it slow & boring. That being said, I'll agree that the soundtrack is *very* good, and [Bones McCoy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WymhX8wCj8) is fantastic background music."
Sword & Sworcery EP,"I found the story quite interesting. There are bizarre characters, alternate realities, mystery, and it's very driven. It's only cliché in the most superficial ways."
Sword & Sworcery EP,"I feel like this is a very specific YSB. The people who will like this game will love it, but everyone else wont see a point in playing it.

I could tell what the game was trying to do by being musically based, but honestly I think a problem for me was that there wasn't much music. Granted I wasn't playing with headphones, but I also wasn't keep the sound down or playing on a phone. I felt like there was lots of ambient noises and I would get to a point that felt like it was going to start to get cool, but then back to just birds chirping.

I also quit when it told me to wait, but it looks like you're not actually supposed to just stand around. 

I did feel like the game was meant to be on a mobile touchscreen the whole time. All the controls just screamed, ""hey look, this is where your thumb would go!""

Also, what's up with the tweeting? I don't want to do it and none of my friends want to see it. This isn't a facebook game so don't make me feel like I'm playing one."
Sword & Sworcery EP,"It's a good YSB suggestion, but it depends on a pretty heavy ""IF...""

IF you like games that are more about the experience than the gameplay, you might like this. If you like a game that's made mostly of atmosphere, you might like this. If you like that most of that atmosphere consists of awesome music, you might like this. Mostly, if you're looking for a game that's mostly about kicking back, relaxing, and playing something that's largely minimalistic in every regard, you'll like it.

I found it one of the most interesting more ""experimental"" games I've ever played. But it's pretty unique, so hard to recommend it at large to anyone that's not particularly interested after taking a look at the style of it."
Sword & Sworcery EP,"I have to agree.  I got the game for my son on recommendation of a coworker and we both hated it.  Maybe it was good on mobile, but it was unattractive and boring on the PC."
Sword & Sworcery EP,"The game is definitely not for everyone, but I loved it and I know a few other people that thought the game was just absolutely euphoric.

As for your complaint about the phases of the moon, [There is a cave that you go to and sit down and it changes to the next phase automatically, so there is no waiting](/spoiler)
"
The Artful Escape,"If you’re a person that gets frustrated easily? Definitely no. You will die. A lot. But if you’re willing to accept death and having absolutely zero gear for about the first month or so, it’s a rewarding game. Been playing since December almost daily and I still get small spikes of adrenaline every now and then. Definitely fun"
The Artful Escape,"It is an incredible game, but you have to be able to accept that dying happens, and is inevitable. Especially starting off, you will be dying more than you will be surviving, but it's okay because it's all a learning process."
The Artful Escape,"tldr

you die = you lose gear/specific tasks progression

you will die a lot, so expect losing time on preparing gear, then looking for a match and be aware of possibility to die in 3 minutes or less

you will be clueless where are You(open map in browser and sooner or later You will be able to figure out where are You), what to do, where to go and probably have gear fear, so instead of playing like a rat try to play ""risky"" and just dont get killed - kill them first or run

its not call of duty or cs:go so if fight isnt in Your favor - flee, flank, reposition or dont fight if You still have element of suprise

focus on doing tasks and upgrading hideout - use guides for them either on YT or wiki

watch some ""new player"" guides and make sure they teach You about what to take for a raid, so You will know how to build Your loadout and most important make sure You have meds to fix broken bones, heavy bleeding, painkillers and medkit that will refill Your hp.

imo you should use best ammo (or best penetration:cost ratio ammo) You can afford (not much choice at lvl1)"
The Artful Escape,"No other shooter out there gets my heart racing like tarkov does. Nothing scratches that itch, or really gets that adrenaline pumping. This game is awesome. You will hate the shit out of it at times, but the highs are like no other."
The Artful Escape,"I recommend trying The Cycle Frontier first, before deciding on Tarkov.

It's free and follows, to some extent, the general gameplay loop. See if you're ok with loot fear, looting, being at risk all the time etc.  
Or if you don't mind spending some money on another game to try out if you'd like this genre, Hunt: Showdown does roughly the same in a more dark atmosphere. It being on steam may be ""good"", since you can refund in under 2 hours of gameplay.

If you can handle that, and you like the more realistic approach of games like Ready or Not, then give it a go!  
And if you don't like the online play of tarkov, there's a really good singleplayer mod, that allows you to play more comfortably, since you'll have a hard(er) time in the (beginning of) online tarkov."
The Artful Escape,"I used to play a lot of tarkov a few years ago, and you have to be willing to put hundreds of grueling hours into it just to get decent enough to have fun. Learning the maps and shooting takes time. Some of these things mightve changed since I played. My response to everyone is no.

Youre constantly going to be going against people with better guns and armor than you all the time, so much so that if you're not using the right bullets you literally won't damage them.

They also know all the spawns and exfils and absolutely will camp them/bum rush them. Just kitted out to go in? Sorry you spawned near a ninja turtle who gunned you down before you even knew what part of the map you're on.

Gearing up was super tedious. After every death you'd have to go rebuy your gun. Rebuy the mags. Rebuy the bullets, rebuy your vest, rebuy your backpack, put bullets in the mag, etc etc.

Insurance on things takes literal real life days. Just, annoyingly long. So even if you insure something it's not like you'll get to use it until days in the future.

Food and water mechanics arent really fleshed out and are more of an annoyance. Same with skills. Missions were alright though, but you'll probably need a guide for each one.

And weirdly one of my biggest gripes is, for the most part it's a hip fire game. Technically point fire. I know that sounds weird given the supposedly ""realistic mil sim"" they were going for. But yeah the non ads shots in that game is just unreasonably accurate. Most of the time you're going to want to point fire instead of aiming down sights.

All that being said the gameplay loop is fun of looting and shooting and base upgrading. It's just behind the most tedious bureaucracy ever imagined. It's like they had a sit-down meeting on how they could ruin a game."
The Artful Escape,If you liked Ready or Not it might be worth checking out Insurgency or Squad
The Artful Escape,"EFT and HUNT:Showdown are the two best looter shooters out rn. Absolute visual masterpieces both of them, and the replayability is endless. They're definitely not casual games, and have to be willing to sit in missions for extended periods of time if you don't want to lose everything."
The Artful Escape,"There is a STEEP learning curve and the game is very rough toward new players. 

If you are okay with doing research on mechanics, watching videos/guides, and sitting in queue for 5-10 minutes to immediately get blown out and your shit stolen, Tarkov may be for you. 

Personally, I love the game. There’s nothing like it. The dopamine rush from finding sick loot or outplaying a team as a solo is unlike anything I have ever experienced. I play plenty of competitive fps games and Tarkov has me wanting to improve my skill just like Valorant and Apex."
The Artful Escape,"I have about 1.2k hours in game, its certainly not for everyone. If you like having your soul crushed frequently by the games you play you'll love it! Jokes aside its very difficult  especially if you play alone. Its also extremely rewarding when the stars align and you succeed against all odds.

Its at least worth the non EOD purchase price just to try."
The Artful Escape,"I'm not sure if others mentioned this yet but you should know that Tarkov has a very serious issue with hackers, at least until very recently when I quit because things were only getting worse. 


On certain maps it was guaranteed you'd find these. People looting the whole area remotely, others looting enemy player's inventories while these were alive, radars for enemies and loot widely available, god mode and aimbots of all kind, etc. 


The game's great otherwise but unless things changed you'll have to get used to these things happening in most matches the longer you last and start to notice. 


Before you decide on anything, I'd recommend you check the game's subreddit and either ask there if things got better or search for related topics."
The Artful Escape,"The biggest thing with tarkov is knowledge. Knowledge is more powerful than skill in that game. 

You have to learn the maps. That alone will be your first 20+ hours. Just going in with the very distinct possibility that you're going to lose your stuff and might not be able to extract. Personally I can easily extract on 2 of the maps. The other ones I haven't got quite there. The more you learn about the game, the better you'll be. Having a plan and a back up plan on where to go and what you're looking for in the raid be it items, food, ammo, weapons, or quest completion  is basically required. But this will come with time. For the first.. While you're gonna just be going in and trying to get out with whatever you can and that's fine. Eventually though it'll be up to you to make that plan because the game doesn't care. 

Its a cool game. Its designed to be a bit stressful and scary though. Its basically a horror game wrapped in a nice fps package. I don't suggest carrying two guns and a ton of other stuff into every raid. I also don't think you should worry to much about losing any particular gear. Death is part of the game, as is losing some stuff. It happens. You must expect it. 

Knowledge though. Knowledge outweighs skill every step of the way in tarkov. The more you learn about maps, extracts, ammo, the healing system, the better you are. Shooting and killing pmc's is like 5th most important thing. Eft is a great game if you enjoy getting a little obsessed with stuff for a while. There's tons of people in the community that make useful content. There's a lot of tools out there to learn from. 
You might spend $45 on the game but if you dive into it. Like actually dive into it. You'll get a lot of time out of it. 

If you're interested in some of that content let me know and I'll throw some links your way. Personally if you've gone down the rabbit hole enough to get this far. I say go for it. There isn't anything else like it out there."
The Artful Escape,"Im going to say probably not. The game is more than just realistic, it is incredibly difficult on purpose. Even good players have maybe 25% success rates. There is a massive learning curve and has in depth knowledge almost requiring the wiki to be open and used in raid for some stuff. You will be hundreds of hours in before you start to hold your own more than likely.

As for the realism… its really not in some ways. Full auto is ridiculously hard to control in most guns, even ones that shouldn’t, and armor for example is probably too effective, further widening the gap between old and new players.

If you want a very challenging experience, it is rewarding once you get gud in its own way, but otherwise most aspects of the game are not for most.

Also, the solo experience is inherently far more difficult that playing in groups and will feel unfair at times."
The Artful Escape,"If you can put in 40 hours a week, go for it. Also understand that the gameplay feels worse with every wipe because they add new realism mechanics. Last wipe it was inertia, this time inertia is more intense, leaning feels like ass, and the weapon recoils are insaaaaaane."
The Artful Escape,Do not recommend. It's a game for lifers.
The Artful Escape,🦀REDDIT IS DEAD🦀
The Artful Escape,No
The Artful Escape,"Try The Cycle: Frontier on steam ita free to play ita more easy but its the same kinda game.

If you hate it dont play tarkov if you love it then you can try it but keep in mind its the harcore version of it"
The Artful Escape,"Check out Hunt: Showdown for a unique but somewhat similar game to tarkov, its pretty awesome"
The Artful Escape,"I’d say watch some gameplay first to see if you will like the general gameplay. I’m a solo player who typically isn’t crazy good at fps games and I have played for a few wipes now. Tarkov is a very frustrating and grueling game that still manages to  give an adrenaline rush in tight situations and sometimes even scare the hell out of me. Although there are some hackers I think this comment section is blowing it way out of proportion. The biggest flaw in the game right now IMO is the recoil on a lot of guns. Right now the recoil is insanely high on some weapons  and pretty unrealistic. If you are looking for a difficult game to challenge yourself, and tarkov sticks out to you, I’d say give it a go."
The Artful Escape,"I would not. This game is hard to the point it sucks. The net code is shit and the sounds are annoying. You don't know where exits are, you don't know if player or ai, you don't know what item is valuable or not. Your inventory sucks too. What key opens what? Everyone is camping. It's a nightmare. 
If all this sounds fun to you go for it. Playing this game is work."
The Artful Escape,"If you think you'll like it, play with friends that can show you the ropes, or find someone inthe many discord servers available that can help you.

I suggest getting the cheapest version to start with, you csn upgrade later if you feel the price is justified."
The Artful Escape,"Tarkov without friends just isn’t fun. Also the playerbase won’t admit this but if you don’t buy the $100+ EOD edition you are at a ridiculous disadvantage. 

Also it runs wayy better on an SSD if you do decide  get it"
The Artful Escape,"No.


In all fairness, it's a good game. Just has a VERY particular following. You literally will either hate it, or love it. Those that do play it typically swear by it. Those that have tried it but dont play it, will likely tell you it's garbage. 



Has a HUGE learning curve. It is very unforgiving. Gameplay gets bland after a while (few hours in my case). There's no incentive to keep playing other than to just play. And since you'll be solo, you 100% would absolutely have a bad time. 



Now if you're a glutton for punishment without reward, or are an above-average to epic FPS player, you might have a good time. Until server wipe and everything you worked and grinded for is gone.... 




I bought it and wish I hadn't. I've played it a total of like 4 hours with a friend who is literally obsessed with the game. 




TLDR: I dont recommend it. It is a decent game but has a very specific demographic. Pain vs Reward ratio is 90/10 unless you're either really good at FPS' or are into that sorta thing.



These are just my personal opinions ofcourse and will likely be crucified by the *""Tarkov Cult""*, but it just seems like a highly complicated PUBG to me."
The Artful Escape,Maybe look into insurgency sandstorm?
The Artful Escape,"Or… hear me out. Hell Let Loose. This game is my latest obsession. WWII realistic fps. It’s not easy, but that’s the point. Everyone in the squad has to communicate to the squad lead who relays to the commander and other squad leads. I’ve even made friends which I haven’t don’t in years because most online games are toxic crap. I’ve been in maybe two toxic matches all year and those people were easily blocked. Just a thought."
The Artful Escape,"Tarkov is probably my favourite game atm with the recent wipe, other than what's been said already I'd check if your PC specs are good enough, I have a GTX 1660, Ryzen 5 3600 and 16 GB of RAM, I can run it at 60-70 FPS reliably on low settings so if you have similar/better specs you should be fine"
The Artful Escape,"Its pretty boring, i just bought it and it takes a long time to do anything of note. 

Its closer to a competitive multiplayer game rather than a realistic shooter. I recommend squad or ready or not for more of a fun game."
The Artful Escape,"Playing solo and new is very very VERY hard. You have to put in the time to watch videos on the mechanics of tarkov, what loot to keep, how weapons and recoil works, how armour works, learn the ammo types, learn the maps and then the extracts, learn to deal with the pain of dying constantly and seeing your stash go to nothing. Your first wipe will just be pain but next wipe you will know how to at least play and do quests.

I do not recommend it unless you have watched many hours of tarkov content and know what you are getting into. Also, just know that refunds are non-existent so dont even think about being able to refund. The game also requires a good pc, im talking 1060 gtx is like 30fps."
The Artful Escape,Yes.
The Artful Escape,"It's neat as long as you have good and consistent internet.

I speak from experience and a nearly broken desk."
The Artful Escape,"It’s the greatest hardcore shooter available. But it’s very frustrating , so if you have low tolerance for bullshit , maybe avoid this one. 

You will die a lot, it will be a skill issue, but sometimes it will be an AI aimbot head eyes, and latency issues. and then you’ll get good and die a lot still. 

But the satisfaction that you get from it is unlike any other.

If you are looking into realistic shooters , maybe try dayz , it has a similar vibe, and maybe less frustrating as it’s more tailored as a survival game, so maybe it’ll be less frustrating. 

Or get both like a cultured individual !!"
The Artful Escape,and you need a good pc tu run the game
The Artful Escape,"Honest answer? No.

It is a really good idea (Not really, lets make an uber realistic shooter, wait, done already.... k, lets make an uber realistic looter shooter?) The gun customization is fantastic, for the most part the gameplay is pretty good, it is fairly unique, yada yada. 

But at the end of the day the game is only worth a fraction of what they charge, mainly due to two reasons: when the game isn't crashing most of the maps run like shit, and even worse, a very large percentage of the player-base is hacking.

You aren't buying a game, you are throwing money in support of a developer with a terrible track record. If that's what you want to do it's your money.

If this wasn't the case I would be behind it 100%. Sadly, I don't actually know anyone who quit Tarkov because it was ""hard"", everyone quit because they are sick of the game crashing, and we've already gotten our fill of hackers from Titanfall."
The Artful Escape,"I totally agree. Also, happy cake day! 🍰"
The Artful Escape,I would like to add that it requires a lot more od your time to achieve something than most other games.
The Artful Escape,Thanks man helps a lot
The Artful Escape,"This is almost word for word what I was going to say, am getting near to 700 hours and nothing even comes close."
The Artful Escape,Yeah that’s what I’m looking for. Yeah it may sucks losing but I want that rush when I take out people and make it out alive
The Artful Escape,"I second this, I have recently “stepped down” from Tarkov to TCF and find myself having far more fun"
The Artful Escape,"Yeah so I have played cycle frontier before and it was pretty fun. My issue with is though was that I didn’t like the futuristic kinda stuff, and I didn’t like how the hub world was laid out. Had fun when actually playing through"
The Artful Escape,"It’s much different from a few years ago, as far as the gear differences. You can’t buy the top tier ammo or armor on the market anymore, so the playing field is much more leveled out. Most of the rest of this is still true though; so overall good advice"
The Artful Escape,Yeah I have played insurgency and around 20 hours or so. Only stopped playing because I felt there wasn’t much to do and none of my friends had it
The Artful Escape,Hunt is much much easier to get the hang of. It would be my suggestion over EFT
The Artful Escape,"Yeah I may end up being frustrated and getting off for the night after losing all my best gear, but I will definitely get back on after. And that rush was what I’m truly looking for"
The Artful Escape,Yeah shoot me those links man :)
The Artful Escape,"I am trying to get back into EFT. Would you mind adding me on discord ( djxgam1ng#1937). I started playing it and stopped and trying to get back into it. It would mean a lot. Thanks

Message me and I will share my personal social channels so you know I am not a spam or bot."
The Artful Escape,I can put 40 hours a week in but it’s more so would I and if the game is good enough
The Artful Escape,"Yeah I have heard the support team is pretty bad, and the refund policy isn’t great"
The Artful Escape,Second this
The Artful Escape,I played it and did enjoy the whole try to get loot and do quests and stuff. But what I didn’t like about that game was the whole future unrealistic parts. And I didn’t like the hub world and how it was laid out
The Artful Escape,"Yeah I have watched quite a few videos on it through the past few days. And I like the idea of the challenge, but that being said idk if I would actually like it. The thought of it sounds fun and exciting since it’s something I could grind and learn, but on the other hand idk if I would actually do that. I mean ofc I want to but that would suck if I lost interest"
The Artful Escape,"I am trying to get back into EFT. Would you mind adding me on discord ( djxgam1ng#1937). I started playing it and stopped and trying to get back into it. It would mean a lot. Thanks

Message me and I will share my personal social channels so you know I am not a spam or bot."
The Artful Escape,"Ok I will keep the ssd thing in mind. Also I am currently trying to convince my friend to get it and he is considering. But yeah idk if I will buy the 100$+ one, at least not til I have played the game and seen if I like it"
The Artful Escape,"I am trying to get back into EFT. Would you mind adding me on discord ( djxgam1ng#1937). I started playing it and stopped and trying to get back into it. It would mean a lot. Thanks

Message me and I will share my personal social channels so you know I am not a spam or bot."
The Artful Escape,Yeah I get the whole huge learning curve but I’m kinda willing for that. The only thing that I’m worried about is getting annoyed and wanting to quit. Ofc I will try not to but I never know. And playing solo wouldn’t help that either
The Artful Escape,Yeah I played that game and got about 20 hrs but I just got kinda bored because the lack of stuff to do and none of my friends had it. I didn’t like the game as much when I would go round on round dying but then I got the hang of it and the game was so fun.
The Artful Escape,"Yeah I actually own that game and played it a decent amount. Not way to much. Just wasn’t a fan of the older times as much, also having no friends to play with made it less cool as well. But if I had friends to play with it would be way better"
The Artful Escape,"I got a RTX 3060, Ryzen 7 2700x, 16GB Ram. I hope that would be ok. But yeah the game seems really fun"
The Artful Escape,Yeah I have played ready or not. And I have checked out squad but never played it. I lovvvve ready or not and would love more games that are realistic like it
The Artful Escape,Yeah I’m cool with learning a lot of those things. But do you think it would be fine just learning some of those as I go? Like the stuff I should keep and not. I feel it would be more fun grabbing stuff and seeing it sells for a lot. Also I have a 3060 so I hope I will be fine
The Artful Escape,"I am trying to get back into EFT. Would you mind adding me on discord ( djxgam1ng#1937). I started playing it and stopped and trying to get back into it. It would mean a lot. Thanks

Message me and I will share my personal social channels so you know I am not a spam or bot."
The Artful Escape,Yeah my internet runs well and doesn’t cut out. Not the best in the world but I don’t think it will be cutting out on me
The Artful Escape,Yeah I played day z when I was pretty young and didn’t like it. But that was more so because me and my friend would spend a long time just trying to find eachother just to die. Never really was to interested in that game though
The Artful Escape,I got a 3060
The Artful Escape,Thank you!
The Artful Escape,"Tarkov is basically just a dying simulator, even after 1000 hours in the game my survival rate is about 40%. I can't stop playing though."
The Artful Escape,"Then I'd say give it a go. Just know that you'll have a HARD time in the beginning, for quite some time.

You can, however, always switch over to the single player mod, if you want an easier start or want more laid back gameplay.

I switched over to single player since normal tarkov can be frustrating with all the veterans knowing the spawns, loot locations etc, while my average time alive was 2-3 minutes in the beginning.
Definitely give the mod a go of that ends up being the case for you, it's way more fun imo :)"
The Artful Escape,"At the same time, because you can't buy top tier ammo, people with top tier armor are way more busted, which was already a problem"
The Artful Escape,"Yeah hunter looks cool and all but I’m more into the realistic shooter stuff. I just basically wanna get as realistic as possible, not currently to into the monsters and stuff rn"
The Artful Escape,"Pestily.

 He's a literal world champion tarkov player. He goes really hard for the 2-3 months after a wipe and makes a lot of content every time. He streams 4-6 days a week on twitch and has a good community all around. He's got like 3 YouTube channels but the two I linked are the most useful. Everything from what he did yesterday in his hardcore series to beginners guides to everything from what to use as a new player to learning extract points in all maps. His discord has groups where you can join up with others.

These are maps everyone uses because imo they are the best. Once you learn landmarks and where you are you can orientate yourself and maps can help you get out of the raids alive.

If you decide to get into tarkov. I hope some of this helps."
The Artful Escape,">and the refund policy isn’t great

No refunds. Only way is a charge back from your bank"
The Artful Escape,If you want to go for it keep in mind what the other people sayd ... And buy it when there a special on it
The Artful Escape,Check out r/escapefromtarkov ! Im kinda a hermit and like my alone time but I’m sure if you maybe make a post there you’ll find someone. Best of luck!
The Artful Escape,This gotta be the sketchiest comment I've seen on reddit.
The Artful Escape,Have to use the comms. Once I found a squad I grooved with I added them on the game. Which is nice bc you can add in game but not friends list. I’ve got at least one solid person to take turns as sniper of take over a squad with.
The Artful Escape,"Yeah you should be more than fine then, hope you enjoy the game if you decide to buy it!"
The Artful Escape,I learned from the vids but you could just do that. Also make sure your ram and cpu are up to par for tarkov. It really isnt optimized well
The Artful Escape,"It's not cut outs its jitter, packet loss and ping. You should be fine though, my internet is just especially bad."
The Artful Escape,your'e good
The Artful Escape,"True that. They’re way more busted, but also way less common."
The Artful Escape,"Yeah that’s fair enough, I just think between the two Hunt: Showdown will bring more enjoyment (having played both)

Honestly the monsters are an afterthought once you’ve played a few hours, the real satisfying part of hunt is the guns. Slow firing, slow reloading, single shot rifles. All these things baked together create the most intense gunfights I’ve played in any game ever."
The Artful Escape,The monsters are only there to draw out PvP battles.
The Artful Escape,Thanks man yeah I will definitely be going through these. I really appreciate it
The Artful Escape,Just trying to get back in the game.
The Artful Escape,Yeah that game does seem fun if you get into it. But I got no one to do it with lol
The Artful Escape,Thanks man. I slowly convincing my friend to get it. If he does then I for sure will
The Artful Escape,"I am trying to get back into EFT. Would you mind adding me on discord ( djxgam1ng#1937). I started playing it and stopped and trying to get back into it. It would mean a lot. Thanks

Message me and I will share my personal social channels so you know I am not a spam or bot."
The Artful Escape,Lol yeah mine might do that but hopefully I will be good
The Artful Escape,"My friend got a 1660 super, you think he would be fine?"
The Artful Escape,"I hated tarkov, but I impulse bought hunt a few days ago and I love it"
The Artful Escape, yes if he's not sure he can look at benchmark

Gris,"I've never played rainworld, but Gris was a pretty chill game to run through. It was also sub 4 hours  to finish a playthrough and I didn't really see a need to start another when I was done, though there are some minor hidden collectathon things to find."
Gris,You might also want to look at the king's bird
Gris,What is that
Gris,It is a game similar to gris and rain world. I feel like it's more aesthetically pleasing than rain world but more challenging than gris. Just look it up on steam
Gris,"I watched the trailer, but I dont think its good (at least for Me)"
Gris,Okay that's fine. Good luck with making a choice on what to buy
Lisa: The Painful,"i’d say danganronpa tbh, it’s a visual novel so there’s no real risk of losing, and it’s one of the best VN series out there imo. it’s really funny, has good characters, and an engaging story. ETG is also good but i’ve played like thirty hours and haven’t beaten it yet, so it might be too hard."
Lisa: The Painful,"I've played Danganronpa, Monster Hunter and Enter the Gungeon. 

Danganronpa is the only one of those with any semblance of good story/dialogue, which is very good. Monster Hunter has ""story"" but it is very basic and not engaging at all. You essentially get through it to get to more fights. Enter the Gungeon is a roguelike shooter game, so you just pop in and go shoot stuff. It definitely isn't like Hades, which has incredibly story and dialogue for a roguelike. 

Danganronpa has pretty interesting game mechanics. The investigation/conversations/trials are all pretty enjoyable and interesting. Monster Hunter's mechanics are unique if you're not used to that type of game, but very similar to other games of its style if you have played them. Enter the Gungeon is a twin stick shooter, so different weapons can do different stuff but otherwise not unique. 

Danganronpa's challenge isn't going to be anything requiring skill. It's about light puzzle solving and logic. Monster Hunter does have a pretty decently sized learning curve before you stop dying a lot. Enter the Gungeon is standard roguelike challenge, so you'll definitely spend a lot of runs dying. 

If you want a story based game that's different than anything you've likely played, Danganronpa. 

If you want a grindy type game where you fight monsters over and over again to get better gear to fight harder monsters, then Monster Hunter. 

If you want a pretty straightforward roguelike loop, then Enter the Gungeon."
Lisa: The Painful,"Turnip Boy Commits Tax Evasion is a fun game, but quite short (about 2 hours). However, the developers plan to release updates for the game in the near future."
Lisa: The Painful,"Monster Hunter is really popular so it’s probably going to win the poll, especially compared to the competition. I wasn’t a fan of it, though, and I tried three different games (Tri, Generations Ultimate, and World — and even Dauntless). The controls are really weird, like not intuitive, and I kinda feel bad hunting these creatures down for no reason"
Lisa: The Painful,Depends on which Monster Hunter
Lisa: The Painful,Haven’t played it but LISA and Undertale should have a common source of inspiration (Earthbound) and from what I know LISA is probably a very psychological game in a way. I think it got the least votes because it’s not that much of a well known game and people tend to recommend more popular stuff without even reading the whole post
Lisa: The Painful,Edited for privacy reasons and in protest of recent changes to the platform.
Lisa: The Painful,Does Danganronpa have choices? Or is it just reading?
Lisa: The Painful,You seem to have some great insight! Do you have any games you would recommend over Danganronpa for quirky story?
Lisa: The Painful,I’ve never played any of them. So the new one? Maybe? Lol
Lisa: The Painful,"it has gameplay, it’s just not very difficult. there is a lot of dialogue that you have to read, but you do have things to actually do."
Lisa: The Painful,"Hmm. By quirky story, are you meaning one that will give you Undertale vibes? Or just out of the ordinary styles? Because I'm not totally sure that I can come up with games super similar to an Undertale, aside from maybe Earthbound, which isn't on Switch.

Donut County is a game where you control a hole that you move around objects in a town and swallow them up. As you swallow up more stuff, the hole gets bigger so you can swallow more stuff. Also, you play as a racoon. It has a lot of funny and quirky one liners.

Katamari Damacy is definitely quirky. You roll up objects in a ball to create stars for the King of all Cosmos, your father.

Phoenix Wright I'd describe as more cartoony than quirky but it's got some pretty over the top characters/stories.

Child of Light is actually very subdued (anti-quirky), but it is a beautiful little RPG with great music where everyone talks in rhymes.

Oxenfree is an interesting supernatural adventure game.

I haven't played it, but I hear good things about Omori on steam. Kind of psychological/dark with some Undertale art style vibes."
Lisa: The Painful,"Iirc switch has 3. Generations ultimate, Rise and Stories 2. Stories is very different from the main series, it's more like Pokemon than an action RPG. GenU is the one with most content and its not too hard, but it's probably harder than Rise so idk how you'd take that as someone who's not into many games.

That said I hope you get into the series, they're seriously addictive so you can play them for hundreds or thousands of hours. For 60 bucks or less, they're great value for money"
Fez,"I just checked FEZ on isthereanydeal.com, and it hasn't been on a sale for over two years. The price you see now is probably the price it will stay on."
Fez,">What makes it so special that I should buy it?

There's a lot going for FEZ. The soundtrack is amazing and the artwork is charming. The puzzle platforming is solid and very enjoyable.

But what makes FEZ *special* might be considered a spoiler, even though it's an older game. What's really memorable about FEZ are its >!second layer of puzzles. You play through the game solving relatively straightforward puzzles, but once you finish you realize there's been a second set of puzzles hiding in plain sight. Going back through the game solving new mind bending puzzles is great.!<"
Fez,Sure it was pretty fun as i remember.
Fez,"The platforming is not very good.

The puzzles are okay but I don’t think you can figure it out without going online and getting a few hints which I think is not good.

The art and music are great though."
Fez,Yep. Fez is a phenomenal puzzle game.
Fez,Ahhhh so it suffers from abstract puzzles. Some of my favorite puzzle games have been tainted by that 😭
Fez,"You can transcribe a whole alphabet code language, then painstakingly go around translating things everywhere, or you can just find the answer online. And I think there’s a part near the end where you have to put in a Konami code style input at a place. It’s one of those things where you would never figure it out in your own."
What Remains of Edith Finch,"A very high recommendation from me. An incredible story told in a brilliantly unique manner, making you truly feel and connect with each character that comes up in the oxymoronic heartbreaking and yet, hopeful story.

It is a game that deserves to be experienced, especially considering that you said that you love story based games. This is one of them.

If I may add one more suggestion to the “story based” games list: please check out To The Moon."
What Remains of Edith Finch,"It's a super good story with creative gameplay and an atmosphere that builds itself up to keep you interested and on edge. It's well-contained and, while not super long, is very impactful and it's stuck with me even a couple of years after initially playing it. Also definitely, I think, one of those ones that you can replay a few times every now and then just to experience the story again. So, yeah, highly recommend!"
What Remains of Edith Finch,No it was very very short and bland story might as well watch it on YouTube you won't miss anything
What Remains of Edith Finch,Definitely. It’s a moving a beautiful story and experience. I loved it.
What Remains of Edith Finch,"It's an outstanding game but it's too short for me to recommend buying it.

It must have been free on xbox at some point because I had it for free"
What Remains of Edith Finch,Just a small fyi that it's a common one to give people motion sickness (so if you're affected by that it may not be worth it). Otherwise a great game.
What Remains of Edith Finch,"I'll have to check that one out too, thank you!"
What Remains of Edith Finch,Would you say that the quality of the story makes up for the length of the game in regards to the price?
What Remains of Edith Finch,"Yeah I definitely think so. The story has a steady rise of mysteries being explored and questions being asked that would possibly start to get tiring if it were much longer, so if anything id say that it's shorter length is a strength if anything. It knows the story it wants to tell and does it without any unneeded fluff."
"Papers, Please",Of course its one of the best indie games i played
"Papers, Please",It’s a good game but you have to be great at multitasking and have good reflexes
"Papers, Please",Yeah that game is legendary
"Papers, Please",Yes it's totally worth it.
"Papers, Please","Yes, that game is amazing"
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"Dead Cells is one of the best games I have played. Period. It's that game that I keep going back to every 6 to 8 months after taking a break and I love it. If you have a decent phone and controller, you can always buy it on mobile."
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"Both Dead Cells and Stanley Parable deluxe are on my wishlist so I can’t help you there. 

But I personally enjoy Neon Abyss. The gameplay is nothing revolutionary, just simple shooting fun, but where the game really shines is in the ridiculous amount of guns and items. Some runs you get really awesome synergy between items and the game ends up playing differently based on what you get. If it’s cheap I would pick it up."
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"Dead cells is a fantastic game, but it gets really difficult the later you get into it."
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"Oh man, hard question. Ultra Deluxe is great so far. It's basically a sequel. Dead Cells is one of those games that you can potentially sink over a hundred hours in for a very reasonable price. I would say it depends on how much time it will be before you can buy another game. Short amount of time - Stanley. Long amount of time - Dead Cells."
The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe,"Dead Cells is great but I'd get it on sale

Stanley Parable I'd lean more towards, I'm waiting on it to go on sale too"
Cuphead,If you don’t game much on your PC then I would get it on switch Or enjoy playing while travelling. Otherwise seems pointless to buy again
Cuphead,"Yes, the DLC alone is enough reason to revisit the game, I felt it was short though, but otherwise the DLC is fantastic. A new character is introduced too (comes with the DLC), with impressive abilities which should make expert mode slightly easier."
Rocket League,"If you are getting it on Steam, hurry up. It may become a Epic Store Exclusive later down the line."
Rocket League,Yes this game is amazing i have over 100 hours on this game
Rocket League,"I myself have around 600 hours in the game and my opinion is that it is tons of fun with friends. The majority of the pro/high tier players prefer the controller for their actions, although the keyboard/mouse strat is decent. When you start off using the keyboard/mouse is fine, but the fine movements and tricks are harder to master with kb/m and so people tend to go the controller when they hit certain rocks on the road. I myself went that road as well and can recommend a controller, but for beginners it wont make a differense, because you have to learn the controls anyways. I'd recommend the game :D"
Rocket League,"Yes

Have around 700 hours in game and when I was last ranked was Champion 3 

Use a controller. K&M is fine for a little while - but as soon as you start to get good you’ll realise there’s an awful lot of stuff that is made so much easier by a controller - it’s far easier just to play with controller from the get go and not have to worry about making a switch and losing progress. 

It’s an awesome little game that I’m sad I grew tired of!"
Rocket League,KBM is playable however I would 100% recommend getting a controller
Rocket League,"I have well over 1000 hours in game. 

I highly recommend it. Highly skill based and will take some quality time to get good, but it is well worth it."
Rocket League,"Rocket league is quite literally the best $20 I've ever spent. 

It's simple to pick up but has depths that take thousands of hours to master. You can be super serious about it, use the in-game training to work on aspects of your game, or just relax and have fun with some friends.  

I don't think any other game has me laughing so hard I can't breathe with any regularity. 

I would 100% get a controller, but I do know one person who is very good with M + KB."
Rocket League,Amazing game.. controller is better.
Rocket League,"Awesome game. The learning curve is steep, I’d recommend lots and lots of patience"
Rocket League,Yes you should. I have around 1300 hours into this game and it’s well worth it. Tons of fun. My favorite online game right now.
Rocket League,Absolutely. It is one of the games I’ve had that I will take a break from and always come back in full grind mode consistently having fun. I feel like it is a timeless game and will be fun for a very long time. I have logged hundreds of hours and am not even almost tired of it.
Rocket League,I have around 1500 hours at RL and YES if you like the concept you will like the game
Rocket League,"For sure get a controller, some people make it work with KBM, but there's just no reason not to drop an extra $10 on a used xbox or PS controller. I use my switch pro controller on pc and it works great. 

The game is a really interesting combination of fun and difficult. Like, the first 5 games I played I might have touched the ball 5 times. But it's so enthralling that I wound up sticking with it. The game constantly rewards time and practice. It truly feels like there's no skill ceiling, and you're always pulling off moves that you couldn't even dream of weeks ago. I'm at like 750 hours on steam and idk if I'll ever stop playing..."
Rocket League,Yes
Rocket League,Tons of fun to kill some time even if you’re solo like I am. On PS4 not console but yeah it’s super fun to play totally worth it
Rocket League,It's good play with whatever
Rocket League,"You should definitely get Rocket League. I love it. Playing with kb/m isn’t a big problem, you should see some insane flip resets by kb/m players. I played my first few hundred hours with kb/m and really enjoyed the game."
Rocket League,"Since you'll be playing with friends that's a hard yes. RL is amazing even if you just play together with a random dude you added because you felt synergy with them. With friends it's so much fun.

As others said, KB&M is absolutely fine, it's just harder to learn and master. I would also recommend a controller down the line but starting with KB&M is not going to be an issue.

If/when you do get it... do yourself a favor and turn off camera shake in the options."
Rocket League,"If you buy a steam controller, which is fairly decent, you get some free games. I got rocket league by doing it, I don't know it it's still the offer"
Rocket League,"Honestly the best $8.99 I ever spent (got it from the humble store at sale plus subscriber discount) countless hours of playtime later, I still find myself playing a match or two everyday, never got bored of it. I’m a keyboard and mouse player myself and while ranked players do prefer to use controller, you don’t necessarily need it if you’re just having fun playing with friends. Hope this helps :)"
Rocket League,Easy to learn hard to master.  It's a huge time drain.  I like it for the competitive scene but it can be a bit addictive in its loot boxes. If loot doesn't entice you then the game is pretty great.  Regarding kbm it was not for me. Controller feels a lot better in my opinion. A couple guys I play with do keyboard and they like it.  So your mileage may vary.
Rocket League,"Amazing game, I suggest buying it before the whole luncher switch.

As for keyboard versus controller. I played a couple months with keyboard and found it was a great game. Thus, spawned me buying a steam controller. I've had to steam controllers break on me (specifically the top bumpers buttons broke). Highly suggest an Xbox or PS4 controller for if you do invest in it.

Takes a week or two to get back to where you were with keyboard yet it's still a blast!

PM me if you want some controller layout suggestions if you go down that route!"
Rocket League,"It worth the try, I have around 800+ hours and still enjoying it with 2 of my friends"
Rocket League,Get it! It's such a great game to play with friends
Rocket League,If your friends couldn’t convince you why can we? Anyway it’s a good casual game but it can suck you for an entire afternoon. But with friends... it will consume days of your life.
Rocket League,Yes
Rocket League,"The game is amazing, i play it on pc and even tho i own a controller i play it on mouse and keyboard. If you got friends totally go for it"
Rocket League,"1: Should you buy Rocket League?

Yes. It's fun for all ages and levels of experience, and can be played cross-platform. 

You might want to limit the in-game chat to only the quick-chat phrases, as in all games, there's a minority who just writes trash all match.

2: Should you buy a controller for this game?

The question is malformed. The correct one is: should you get a controller for your PC? The answer is yes. 

Rocket League happens to one of the games that are generally better with a controller, but if you don't mind the slight clunkiness of keyboard and mouse, you don't NEED to get a controller. But it will play better with one, like most driving games benefit from analogue triggers and a stick instead of keyboard and mouse."
Rocket League,"I would say that it's definitely not for everyone. However, if the only thing that's keeping you from buying it is the fact that you have to use a controller, I'll just say that TONS of games are better with a controller. Including platformers, racing games, 3rd person games, fighting games, and probably alot more that I didn't think of. It's a very nice investment"
Rocket League,"It’s a game that never really gets old. And you don’t have to fork alot for a controller, i still use a Xbox 360 on my PC"
Rocket League,"Definitely, for me it has been the only game that I have played without getting bored to it. Every match is pretty unique and so fun."
Rocket League,The game is good but it's only a matter of time before Epic Games ruins it.
Rocket League,"If you have a lot of spare time go ahead. The game took me forever to actually be good, but when you are it’s really fun."
Rocket League,"I have 2500 hours. If you do get it, don't be discouraged if you suck, everybody does at first because you've never really played a game like it,I know I hated it at first. Just push through the phase while having fun with your friends. Once you learn to hit the ball semi-consistently it starts getting really addictive. It's a really fun game overall and would highly recommend you get it. 
Edit : I forgot to do words
Edit : forgot more words"
Rocket League,Yes
Rocket League,"I'm sitting at 1200 hours played and diamond 2 in 3's mode is the highest I've gotten. Once my friends stopped playing it basically ruined the game for me. Using a mouse and keyboard is just silly for this game. It's also not that much fun to play by yourself for more than a game or two at a time, unless you just really like to depend on people who probably suck to try to build your rank in solo 3s. If you don't care about competitive matches, all the silly side games are pretty fun."
Rocket League,"If you don't want to invest lots of money, you can get controller from wish / aliexpress (I mean, its just a controller, whats so much about it) or get a pretty cheap moga controller which is primarily used for androids, but has an unofficial free port that lets you connect it to pc ( MogaSerial it is ) and controller problem is kinda done. After all, you can ask for friends account to check out hows it going for you or download cracked version for singleplayer tryout."
Rocket League,Playing with keyboard on RL is doable. I can play both controller and keyboard after getting used to the layout.
Rocket League,Yes
Rocket League," The game is incredibly cool but you need to grind A LOT and try not to rage that much. Also u need to watch a hella lot of content on youtoube such as tutorials and average gameplay. 
 Oh and btw stay away of the random queues in ranked"
Rocket League,Yes. Ask me why
Rocket League,"I’ve got 2,400+ hours in the game. Some of the pros have 5-8,000 hours in the game. Definitely worth picking up. However, the community is EXTREMELY toxic. Even in the higher ranks of GC. So if you can manage to ignore the toxicity then yeah pick it up because it is hella fun and very rewarding once you learn the mechanics."
Rocket League,"I hate rocket league.....
You should definately get it though. Lots of fun with friends.
Stupid rocket league."
Rocket League,"I am a KB+M player. 1500+ hours, and reached grand champ 2 seasons ago. It is possible!

The reason people (and 99% of the pros) prefer controllers is that you can't steer halfway with a keyboard. Your car either goes straight on or turns all the way, which is less precise. It has never been a problem for me though.

But yeah, as my hours show, this game is awesome and I fully recommend it."
Rocket League,Yes u should I like it
Rocket League,"If your friends have it it’ll be fun for a few hours. 

You really need to like this type of game to invest more than 50 hours. 

I got the platinum trophy on PS4 and then deleted it"
Rocket League,Coming from someone with over 850 hours logged...absolutely. And getting a controller isn’t just a rocket league investment. There are TONS of PC games that play better with a controller
Rocket League,"Game is worth it, your friends are right! Controller is easier, but only if you used one before,since you don't seem like you have, just use keyboard the difference is actually non-existent, you could play as good as a controller player, it's just a little easier to hold a controller than keyboard for some, the game does have a insane learning curve
For example if you want to reach the highest rank in the game you need approximately 6000+ hours in the game, but it all depends on your playstyle really, you should get it though, it's really fun in general and never goes too hard in you from the start"
Rocket League,"A. Yes, because it's very fun. I also recommend a controller, but some people enjoy it with KBM.

on the other hand.. 

B. No, because Psyonix is terrible about dealing with people wityh toxic chat syndrome. I got a death threat recently and apparently the guy hasn't been sanctioned in any way. I don't want anyone giving them any more money until they take more action to deal with the hatred of LGBTQ folks and black people that we see in the chat every day."
Rocket League,Amazing game I have 1000 hr
Rocket League,"rocket league. I have 1700 hours in it.

it's cheap and i think it's worth a try.

the skill ceiling is so high, i'm shit compared to people ranked above me. 

not only that, you can really add a lot of style to your gameplay, there's a lot to learn, they've added some different types of game modes. There's cool training packs and workshops. 

I didn't like the game at first. I played it, i was brand new, like could barely hit the ball, my first week, I think i got into a casual match with gd JHZER, i'm not sure cuz i didn't know who he was at the time i didn't find out until later but here's how it felt for a brand new player, playing against what I can only describe as gods.

the ball would go into the air, and i'm setting myself up for when it lands.. it doesn't even get to the top of it's arch and this fuckers hitting it down field.. but guess what.. there's another guy already there, he fucking hits it, we should be good to get it, but now, the first fucker is already there. 

i thought they were gd teleporting, it was crazy. turns out you can just get that good at reading plays.

it's highly skill based, the community can be toxic in game, but honestly if you hit up the subreddit and ask about things they got you.

not to mention just getting into RL has been an awesome gaming experience, the RLCS is fun as hell to watch, there's some amazing damn goals. 

i think if you pick it up, and you enjoy your first few weeks you're gonna love it. and honestly the first few weeks are kind of the best, a shit ton of laughs, goals that you think are crazy, it's a lot of fun, the goals get crazier, you meet teammates eventually.

rocket league is a hell of a game, i'm a little concerned for it's future now with the epic buyout thing, but im giving it a chance because it's been an amazing game.

not to mention rocket pass, two tiers, premium and free, it costs 10 keys to get premium, which is 10 dollars, but, if you make it to the end tiers you start getting awesome painted items and special editions, and you end up getting those ten keys back and can use it on the next rocket pass, plus, if you get premium, you still get all the free tiers items, so ever other level you're getting two items.

there's lots of cars, you can do workshops to practice specific parts of the game, like aerial control or dribbling. Bakkes mod is a lightweight easy mod that adds a lot to the freeplay training. 

and the best part is, that it is a grind.. but it never has felt like a grind, it's just me hopping on, playing games, getting my ass kicked, and having fun trying to score awesome goals.

i think it's a game everyone should give a shot, because you can get really great and feel pretty good about yourself if you put in the time."
Rocket League,"In the 600 hours I've played on PC, I have only used a controller. It may be I only started to try one 200 or 300 hours in, but I could never get the hang of it. 

Remapping the controls on kb were cruical for me. It allowed me to have a degree of control that I felt I did not get with a mouse"
Rocket League,buy it 100%
Rocket League,"I play on PC and exclusively use KB/M, however I have tried to use a controller but I just didn't like it as much. Personally I enjoy playing on KB/M much better, and I am pretty good, however I am certain that because of that I will almost certainly never be able to do any good aerial maneuvers."
Rocket League,"Been playing it casually since the release with keyboard and mouse. I've reached grand champion with it and I'm better than my friends that play with a controller. 
To my understanding, the controller takes a lot of hours to get used to but once you do, theoretically, you'd be better than a keyboard and mouse player simply because the controller has more precision on the car's rotation. It might not look like a big deal but once you start climbing up those ranks and get used to your car, precision will matter a lot. 
My opinion is a bit biased because I play with a keyboard but I think it's easier to switch from keyboard to a controller than the other way around so even if you don't want to invest in a controller now, you can still play the game with your friends. 
Ah, and one more thing, don't get caught up in the salty environment that, sadly, the game has these days."
Rocket League,Yes. Great party game.
Rocket League,Yes. Great party game.
Rocket League,YESSSSSS IT IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST ESPORTS UP AND COMMING
Rocket League,Yes
Rocket League,No
Rocket League,Rocket League is one of my favorite games and I got all my friends into it and we play it every day now definitely worth it lots of fun
Rocket League,"Only if playing with friends. Nowadays the rocket league community has become extremely salty and, eventhough I've poured so many hours into it and had fun doing so, I can't have fun on it without playing with friends anymore.

Edit: believe it or not, this is my opinion. I'm not saying OP won't have fun with game. I'm saying my enjoyment with it has greatly declined"
Rocket League,Yes.
Rocket League,Yeah you should
Rocket League,Si Señor
Rocket League,Is this even a question?!
Rocket League,Hell no
Rocket League,"It’s a good game, and a good reason to buy a controller.  I didn’t have a controller for years, but finally breaking down and buying one turned out to be a really good choice, now I have three different kinds.  Some games just feel better on a controller, and it’s nice to have the option.  

If you’re curious, I like the PlayStation controller best of the bunch as an all-arounder, I have a Steam controller that I appreciate for its versatility and strangeness, and I have a couple 360 controllers that get the job done but are kind of unremarkable in comparison.  Oh can get those pretty cheap these days, though, so that would probably be my recommendation if you’re reluctant about the whole concept."
Rocket League,Not a big fan.  Oh and you can get an ok 360 controller on amazon for like $15
Rocket League,"Of all the games I own; RL is my favorite. 5 minute games, easy to pickup but very hard to master.

No matter what game I have, I'll still pop in the $15 gem once a week."
Rocket League,"Absolutely buy the game, but in order to play it well be prepared to put in a LOT of time. I mean literally a lot. Personally I have close to 2 thousand hours into the game and still have trouble doing some things. Community at higher ranks can also be VERY toxic, seen some compare it to LoL or R6S levels, so also be aware of that"
Rocket League,ALL I CAN SAY IS IT IS THE BEST GAME EVER MADE. Fr tho. I have so many games and I play Xbox everyday but rl is the only one I crave. The only one I wanna get better at. Constantly. And never get burned out or bored. Do your self a favor and risk the 20 bucks or whatever. On its own it will prove how good it is
Rocket League,yes
Rocket League,Boi it gives you cancer
Rocket League,Yes
Rocket League,Its pretty fun i would buy it
Rocket League,Amazing game yes. Big learning curve so be prepared!
Rocket League,Yeah get it it’s very fun and entertaining and at the same time cheap and some of the rlcs (rocket league champion ship) players use mouse and keyboard it is perfectly fine to play on m and c
Rocket League,"unplayable with a keyboard :D

i sit back relax and rest on my controller.

&#x200B;

the goals are ON!"
Rocket League,"Why dont just buy it? if you dont like it just refund it on steam, you can refund before you have played 2 hours"
Rocket League,"450 hours here. It's a great online game that's competitive, yet not as emotionally taxing as most shooters. Deffo recommend"
Rocket League,"A lot of people here seem to like it, but I kinda feel like those who enjoy the game are more likely to comment than those who are indifferent to it or don't like it. So I'm gonna try to skew the average a little here. I don't really like the game. Yeah it's fun enough to play with friends to pass the time if you *need* something to just kill time, but the game itself gets so monotonous and repetitive. Drive around, bump a ball, score. Rinse and repeat. It just gets boring really quickly. Yeah I know there is a skill requirement for certain things and that there are advance techniques that can be used, different fancy or stylish playstyles, but that really doesn't change all that much about the game.  Yeah there are a couple of other game modes, but I feel like there is only so much fun to be had batting a ball around with virtual RC cars. It's fun for a few matches, but just gets old fast. Idk what games you're into, but I feel like it appeals to a certain niche of people, specifically people who like sports/team-based games and party-games, as it's kind of a hybrid of the two. 

If you're going to have to invest in the game AND a controller, I just wouldn't buy it (unless it's less than $10 or so. Idk what it's on sale for right now.). If I did buy it, I wouldn't want to spend more than MAYBE $10 on it."
Rocket League,"Definitely. I play with keyboard and it's not that bad, just takes time getting used to. The initial learning curve is a bit steep, but enjoyable nonetheless."
Rocket League,"You can also play with keyboard and mouse (there are **pros** that are playing without controller) buy the game especially if you have friend to play with, it's definitely worth it!"
Rocket League,You don't need a controller to play. The game isn't my cup of tea but it can be fun for me to watch. Lots of pros play k&m
Rocket League,"Well i have around 1.1k hours on that game (2nd most played) and im champion 3. Which is basically 1 rank away from the highest rank and i play with a keyboard and mouse.

Rocket league is a very fun and entertaining high skill gaped game. Buy it, enjoy it with friends and learn everything about it then if you’re really considering grinding ranked and being really good, a controller makes the car easier to control + you can do more fancy stuff with it."
Rocket League,Yes
Rocket League,"Basic controller is all that is required \[xbox 1s or PS4\]

Keyboard and mouse will have you tapping and clicking and silling \[sounding sily\] , whereas a controller, is in both hands. Fluid. Customized controls. Accelerate/Brake have paddles - so you don't push the button fully.

You also get tonnes of mind-games  in this world. Don't always shoot. Bait that enemy.  Tactics, and strategy is fast paced, and will only keep rising in speed the further up you go.

&#x200B;

It's 5 minute games. You either make it or break it with your partner that you pair up with.

Quick chat is great.  {Controller - I can play fluently in front of my keyboard - and then easily type something long, IF I NEED TO - not if i want to. } \_ You can mute - report/ abusive or vulgar people.  You may report unprofessional play. XP Farmers \[AFK in-game\]

&#x200B;

5 minute doses of this is addictive. I can lose 2-3 hours at night getting lost in this universe.

&#x200B;

Flying cars. Rocket propelled jet boosting. it's amazing.

&#x200B;

Learning to flip, rotate and all that stuff is good in the beginning.

if you enjoy action games, racing games, strategy, team-work , get it.

OH: there's also TONNESSS of customization with most \[88%\] of the cars available to pick just with the base game. And it's all visual, so the game relies on accuracy matching your car's moves with hitboxes.

&#x200B;

No robot will ever be able to hack this game, because you require skill to play. Even when you're bored, you can play 1v3 vs the bots to just get better overall.

&#x200B;

P.s. Anyone judging Epic games store - the servers, since 27 August, are officially with them now. So if you're still playing and having fun, then stop being negative, and keep playing positive. 

Go get some real goals.  Flick flack flippers"
Rocket League,"Its is a very enjoyable game.I have been playing since 2015 and am still playing.KBM is harder to master,but still playable."
Rocket League,Buy it! This game always is fun to play and I would strongly recommend controller but it could be playable on K&M at lower level elo if you are feeling stingy
Rocket League,"i have been playing this game since it came out, other games ive played along side like witcher/fifa/farcry/cod have come and gone but rocket league i still play every week

theres not really much of a story/ interesting levelling up system, the addicting part is how your skills improve week on week and this isnt capped either you never stop improving"
Rocket League,"Man I tell you, I only have 3 months on the game and I'm loving it. If you have lots of friends that is perfect because the fun is extra. About mouse and keyboard, don't worry. I have a controller and I pretty much suck. I'm a gold 2 lol, and the majority of my friends use mouse and keyboard and they are either of my rank or above, you shouldn't worry about getting one unless you want to go pro or to the higher ranks."
Rocket League,YES YES YES YES YES YES YES
Rocket League,"Waste of money getting a controller tbh, unless you are invested in getting to do advanced mechanics for 400h+ players above C1"
Rocket League,"Yes everyone should play it, yes you can use a keyboard but a controller really unlocks the games addictive level of control."
Rocket League,Yes! Still play on my off time well over a year after purchasing.
Rocket League,"I'm gonna say no, barely ever is meaningful new content added and throughout its life cycle Psyonix has only doubled down on monetization. 




Having played since season 2 it's really sad the path the game took."
Rocket League,"It's just an okay game if you have a controller, but if you don't, it's horrible."
Rocket League,"If you're into soccer or cars, definitely get it. I'm not into those and only played it for about 10 hours. But I'm sure you'll enjoy it if you have friends to play it with.

Plus, playing with a mouse and keyboard isn't that hard. You can still enjoy and learn the game with mouse and keyboard."
Rocket League,"why, what will happen?"
Rocket League,"Yeah, the Epic store is a shitshow. Better get this before it isn’t available on Steam anymore. I guarantee they’ll have “crossplay” issues between Epic and everything else."
Rocket League,It has splitscreen and it is even better if you play with a friend. I play with my little brother and we have a lot of fun. 200 hours here.
Rocket League,"How long did it take you to get used to the controller? I feel like I'm peaking and it might help me, but it'll be so frustrating at first."
Rocket League,Bruh how are you c3 when you only have 700 hours? That’s preposterous!
Rocket League,"As a KB+M player, what specifically is made easier?"
Rocket League,Had to add the champion 3 lol
Rocket League,[deleted]
Rocket League,"My friends convinced me but I wanted to hear from another voice, i will definitely consider it, thanks"
Rocket League,[deleted]
Rocket League,The company “Epic” purchased “Psyonix” who developed and published Rocket League.
Rocket League,Get it now! 100% worth it.
Rocket League,"It's an awesome game and once you start understanding the mechanics a bit you can do some really crazy stuff.  1,175 hours here"
Rocket League,"It took me around 2 to 3 weeks, but that was when i was playing for like 4 hours a day to get better. You just have to fiddle around like a fish like i did to get used to it. I just played on my own rank at that time and felt i was improving more rapidly that way as well ( like i practise all my stuff, in ranked on my main playlist 3s). Just dont care about your rank for a second and try to get to the point where you're standing rn with kb/m and try to improve from there, then you will see the results and wont be to frustrated as well (if you are ;p)"
Rocket League,"It depends on your rank and technical ability, I started with mouse and keyboard for two months or so stuck at silver and then bought a controller, since I didn't have (and still don't) so much technical ability, I found it very easy to get me used to the gamepad. Started losing a lot, but wasn't much of a problem since u started getting better, a month and a half later and I'm a comfy gold 2 lol. G'luck!"
Rocket League,"Thank you? 
When I look back to when I played (I stopped a couple months ago) they where very focused hours - I spent very little time messing about and just focused on improving.
That’s almost definitely why I got burnt out so soon so it really is a shame as it’s such a great game"
Rocket League,I mean it totally depends on your configuration and control scheme - but for many the joysticks allow you to make the tiny adjustments that you can’t get with a keyboard
Rocket League,Subtle flex ;)
Rocket League,[deleted]
Rocket League,"Then what are you waiting for? I don’t know how much it costs now but It’s a must buy even without DLCs. 
If you have friends to play with I won’t waste a second for consideration. 

Join the league and fly like a rocket :)))"
Rocket League,"On the other hand Epic Client has been releasing free games every week or so. I installed it to get Enter the Gungeon for free and have since then picked up several other games I have not yet installed.

Since RL has already been around for a while Epic might be planning on giving it away free for a limited time (or even permanently). I think What Epic is trying to do is get people other than Fortnite players to install and start using Epic Client. Giving away RL for free might appeal to a chunk of casual non Fortnite players they are trying to attract."
Rocket League,But don't worry use code miniladd in the epic game store
Rocket League,"They didnt purchase psyonix, they bought an exclusivity for rocket league"
Rocket League,"1430 hours, I think I have a problem."
Rocket League,Thanks! Will probably try soon :)
Rocket League,"I know, but what movements specifically? I already have 1500+ hours on kb+m so I'm not switching, but I'm curious"
Rocket League,[deleted]
Rocket League,The Epic client is a security nightmare though
Rocket League,"Yeah the current ones are Celeste and Inside, which I can’t recommend enough. (I also already installed the launcher to use Epic’s Unreal Engine)"
Rocket League,[deleted]
Rocket League,"At this point I think it's no longer considered a problem, but a lifestyle haha"
Rocket League,That's where I'm at. Only D2
Rocket League,[deleted]
Rocket League,"400-ish hours on KBM, 1,000+ hours on controller here.

Obviously, steering and acceleration are a lot more sensitive with controller. You can go *very slightly* to the left or right, which is a lot harder with PC since it's all or nothing. You can also control your speed better, since you don't have to press brake or accelerate all the way every time. 

There are also some things easier on KBM. Half-flips are 100000x easier on KBM (it took me ten minutes to learn them on KBM, still learning to do them consistently on controller), and generally a lot of stuff are more consistent. Since every time you diagonal flip or front flip, it'll be the exact same, it's easier to do things like wallshots and it's easier to predict where your shot will go. And if you're into freestyling, some players (Evample, for example) use KBM because it's easier to get things like multiple flip resets.

Overall, I think neither one is objectively better, so I think it's worth trying both controller and KBM out to see which one you find better. Personally, I found controller easier and I managed to switch from KBM to controller in one afternoon, but others might find KBM easier (some pro players, like Yukeo play entirely on KBM but he's on the same level or even better than the majority of his controller peers)."
Rocket League,Honestly couldn’t tell you - I just speak from the experience of others I guess
Rocket League,Im champ 3 with controller and i have another account that i use specifically for kbm and I am only diamond 2 on that one.
Rocket League,"I've seen this mentioned a lot and is what keeps me from installing it.

Is there any specific reasons as to why it is a security nightmare?"
Rocket League,\*citation needed\*
Rocket League,Yes it sucks.
Rocket League,Oh shit I guess I was wrong. Sorry
Rocket League,Just hit 2600 hours myself.
Rocket League,I suppose you play more on the controller account?
Rocket League,"Some reddit user/programmer wrote a very detailed list of reasons why but I can't remember where it was.


Basically though, your information and credit card info is just a few keystrokes away from someone who even knows a decent amount of coding."
Rocket League,"No, according to the guy who told you yes"
Rocket League,"[https://nickcano.com/epic-games-spyware/](https://nickcano.com/epic-games-spyware/)

It isn't, that link explains why not"
Rocket League,I do simply because the controls are much more fluent and easier to make fine movements
Rocket League,"What a shame, I was hoping to install it to play BL3.

Thanks for the info!"
Rocket League,"*(Which I would assume is similar to most websites you use to buy stuff. I mean, we see data breaches and stuff every year with big companies. It's not like EGS is the devil and all is terrible. There are worse things out there. At the end of the day it's just another client to run games).*"
Rocket League,The least you could do is link
Rocket League,Maybe use a pre paid giftcard instead of a credit card. That's what I try to do with online purchases
Rocket League,Yeah but it at least takes a little effort and knowhow to steal your shit on other platforms. EGS is basically giving it away
Rocket League,Can you even read?
Rocket League,"Use privacy.com and designate a card for Epic Games. Set a spend limit, make it a single use card, whatever!"
Rocket League,"See, if that's really the case then what's stopping one of us from just waltzing through their whatever-security and stealing peoples information? (besides our morals and the fear of consequence, of course, at least for me haha) Have they ever had a severe security breach? You guys all make it seem like its so easy to just break their security. Is there proof?"
Rocket League,"Yes, no link, and your explanation offers no proof or reasoning, so can you?"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,The paid version is really just a love letter to people who loved the base game.  I LOVE DDLC but I can't recommend paying for the deluxe version when you should just play the free version on Steam.
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"I finished the game a while back and decided to buy the physical copy of DDLC+ for console. I feel like the novelty of the free version isn't captured well but is close enough to the original experience. I personally enjoyed the side stories more than I thought as they were a nice change of pace. After 100%'ing the game, I found the new additions to the lore pretty interesting. Along with the goodies included in the physical edition, overall it was a pretty decent buy."
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"The newer version is cool and all, but what I don’t like about it is that it advertises itself as a horror game on the case so if you’re gonna trick ‘em with it, be careful. The warnings also still pop up so they’ll have a hint as to what’s ahead.

The new version is still good, but I don’t think you’re missing much if you don’t go for it. The Side Stories are nice but not canon so they don’t add much."
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"Ehhh, It's not worth 25$. I would pay 10 at most."
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Out of curiosity - how do you even finish this game on switch? I though this game is impossible to port to consoles
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"If you're buying it to trick friends, sure. 

The Switch version is DDLC+, which has some extra content (songs, images, side stories) that flesh out the characters a bit more. And a new batch of hidden data if you want to look into the meta game... But honestly, you could just watch some lore videos if you want to know what gets revealed. 

IMO, the original was free and that's why I got it. I wouldn't pay $25 to play the remaster if I already finished the first. But if you're using it to prank friends and have the money to blow? Sure, go ahead."
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,How do they do the data management stuff on the switch?  Seems pretty pc-mandatory to me…
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Isn't it free lmao
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"No, play it on pc. There is a *thing* that I guess only works on pc, and is very important."
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"No, play it for free on Steam and be done with it. Not sure what they’re charging on the switch, but it’s almost certainly more than this game is worth."
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,This is free on steam I thought
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"25 on switch ? it’s like $14 or something on steam, don’t get ripped off"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Its a free game.
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Yes.
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Yes
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,No
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,No
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Yes
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Yes
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,*just monika*
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"Is it worth playing if you know what's coming, but nothing else?"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Yes
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,The fuck is dokidoki
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"It’s free on pc, please go to pc"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Bought it on switch. No regrets here! For me it’s worth the convenience of playing it on a switch over a pc
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"This. The extra content is mostly just lore and backstory stuff and if you hate reading and finding random hidden notes, it's probably best to just watch the lore videos on YouTube. I feel like I got the most out of those content by watching lore videos but that might just be me because I hate the ""finding notes to get the rest of the story"" type of gameplay cuz I miss a lot of stuff anyway."
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,The game launches a fake pc window in which you use the controller to move an ingame mouse to play doki doki
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Only the original on PC
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,The ports essentially emulate a desktop. The switch port will give the same experience.
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,The free one is the old version but the paid steam version is probably cheaper
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,There was a new version of the game released with new content. But it's paid
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,It’s *free* on Steam!
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,he's talking about doki doki plus
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,you sir have committed great sin
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"oh, that kind of ruins the fun of that part of the game"
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,Not the same experience when it's like that.
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"That's the old version, the new version which is mentioned in this post has new content but is paid."
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,I guess but they really add a lot more than the original.
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"Nonsense. It's the same game, just with an emulated desktop instead of an actual one."
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"Oh, right! My bad."
Doki Doki Literature Club Plus,"Yeah, and the emulated desktop just feels artificial as fuck."
Sifu,I would buy Sifu
Sifu,And which one all star battle or goat sim
Bastion,"Bastion I love. Death’s Door didn’t really grab me. One person’s opinion. That said, the combat in Bastion feels nothing like Hades. It is way slower and much more akin to an older Zelda game."
Bastion,"Caveat: Haven't played Hades or Pyre yet - couldn't even tell you anything about them, other than they're Supergiant. Loved Bastion and Transistor both. Expect to pick up (and enjoy) Hades and Pyre at some point, but there're a lot of games to play!

\--

Bastion is effectively a mostly linear top-down adventure game, sort of a ""Legend of Zelda""-lite. Not much in the way of 'level puzzles' except for some challenge content for upgrades. Lot of recognizing enemy attacks and dodging or blocking, then retaliating with your guns or melee weapons.

You get a dodge, two weapons/items to use - each with some binary customizations of your choice, and a variety of enemies to fight requiring specialized techniques, weapons or tactics.

It's the narration and music that really sells it, in my eyes, but the combat is perfectly serviceable and enjoyable -- if perhaps a bit casual to start. If you find it too easy, you can adopt challenges (curses) that make things harder for you (there's a few achievements for doing them all at once, for example). The narrative is not made entirely explicit to you, but there's enough to get a sense of what's going on and put the pieces together, much as you'll be doing throughout the game.

Being their first game, I suspect you'll find some of it primitive or the like, but frankly so far everything I've played they've done (see above titles) or seen has been an excellent offering. I expect no less of Hades and Pyre, and you should expect no less of Bastion or Transistor.

*^(“....Hey Red, we're not going to get away with this, are we?”)*"
Bastion,Death’s Door is fantastic. It shouldn’t be too hard on you. I loved every minute of it
Bastion,"Bastion is great, and a lot easier than Hades. Mostly twin stick gun stuff, so think Hades’ ranged weapons rather than the melee ones. Good amount of customization during the linear story. There are a few optional challenges if you want to test your limits, but beating the game in general is something most people can do in 6-10 hours.  

In terms of overall game experience, Bastion has solid combat, great aesthetics, and an amazing voice-after narrator that comments on everything you do. Just an amazing voice that makes me smile every time I play the game.  

I played it originally on Xbox live Arcade like 10 years ago, and again more recently on Switch. The game still totally holds up! A++"
Bastion,"I agree! I'm a trophy away from platinum and loved every minute of it.. really fun game, and beautiful too"
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"It has more content now, so it won't get that boring, but it could still have more content, but for 40% off,I'd say it's worth it"
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"It was a nice game for free when I got it from PlayStation Plus, but I would say no. I like the developers and the concept of the game, but it just gets boring really fast. Unless you have a group of friends to play with, I can’t recommend it. If it ever become free-to-play though, then check it out definitely."
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,I don't know where people get the idea that the game is dead. It really isn't. I never have trouble finding games.
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"My friends don't play this game, though. Would you recommend Payday 2?"
Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout,"Sorry, I haven’t played it."
Outlast,Plague is a great game . Keep in mind it is **NOT** very demanding if you are into souls games.
Outlast,A Plague Tales is really good.
Outlast,"I haven't played Outlast 2 so I can't compare, but I'm really enjoying A Plague Tale. Lots of sneaking about and avoiding soldiers and (god damned) rats. It isn't really comparable to Dark Souls / Bloodborne in terms of atmosphere, but it is dark and can get reeaally nasty at times. I keep pitching it to friends calling it TLoU: 14th century France."
Outlast,"My friend is a fan of outlast but he like 1st one better, tale have  better story."
Outlast,"Personally I like horror settings but don't really like the typical horror game gameplay, so I'd put my money on Plague Tale. Great game with an intense atmosphere, while not relying solely on what I perceive as boring jump scares and chase sequences. But that's just personal preference and I realise that there are a big number of people to whom games like Outlast are a lot of fun, yourself among them. So go with what you feel I guess? Or wait for a nice sale on one of them and get that one first :)"
Outlast,"Don’t get outlast 2 all it is, is a bunch of chase scenes and it honestly gets to the point where you’re like “oh I’m running again” and it’s not scary"
Outlast,"My friend called it the Rats of us hahaha. I think I'm going with Plague tale, thanks guys!"
Shovel Knight,You're gonna enjoy it. It has all the DLC from the past years and each character has a unique playstyle within them.
Shovel Knight,"I think of it more like Mega Man instead of Mario or those others, but yeah, you should still like it."
Shovel Knight,You will definitely enjoy it
Shovel Knight,I know nothing about Mega Man lol
Shovel Knight,"Thanks, good to know I will enjoy it"
Shovel Knight,Do it. I got it on sale a few months back and like you I had never played it. I absolutely love it.
Shovel Knight,Mega Man or Shovel Knight?
Shovel Knight,Shovel Knight
Shovel Knight,I am probably going to do it to day. Thank you for the advice
Shovel Knight,Awesome!  I think you will enjoy.  Great game and great value in that package.
Shovel Knight,"Thanks to you I got it. I have been enjoying it so far! Gave me a good dose of nostalgia for Super Mario World, for some reason."
Shovel Knight,Hell yes!  I’m glad.  Enjoy it.   Tons of stuff to do.
Shovel Knight,Thanks
Slay the Spire,"Slay the Spire and Hades are both excellent games, haven’t played Cult of the Lamb though. 

Go for Hades if you value gameplay and story more than replayability because I couldn’t bring myself to play it after completing the story.

Slay the Spire is better in short bursts and has infinite replayability, it’s something like a palate cleanser that you’re not gonna play 24/7 but you crave it from time to time and you know you can play it any time you want."
Slay the Spire,"Ooooo, tough choices in general because all three are really enjoyable rogue-likes mixed with other genre styles. I say though that Hades is very much the best. Best action/combat, and the story/relationship mechanics are amazing. 

Slay the Spire is good... If you like card-based games, personally, I dislike them. But it was still a good enough game that I put in a few hours before moving on.

Cult of the Lamb is cute, and I loved the cult/town-building aspect. It takes a bunch of aspects of other rogue-likes: the card aspect from games like StS, the talent/legacy trees like Rogue Legacy, the randomly generated levels and power ups like Enter the Gungeon and Hades - and puts them together with cutesy animals who commit to Lovecraftian horror tropes. But IMo, even with the recent expansion, the cult-building is a bit shallow and the combat decidedly not polished compared to Hades.

YMMV, but I go Hades > Cult of the Lamb > Slay the Spire."
Slay the Spire,"This is a tough one to answer, because all are good games, but all for different reasons imo. Personally though, Cult of the Lamb is my personal favorite. Maybe it's just the cute aesthetic with dark undertones and town building, but I really love the game."
Slay the Spire,"Hades, then cult of the lamb, then slay the spire"
Slay the Spire,"StS is one my all-time favourites. Have played it to death and it’s still a go to. But a run is more like a discrete match at this point and there’s not really any progression aside from developing one’s own skill.

Hades I really enjoyed but kind of fizzled out on it for some reason. I’ve been meaning to give it another crack - I’m sure it’s just me and leaning away from action games as I get older and slower and badder."
Slay the Spire,"Dead Cells was my favorite action roguelite until I played Hades. Hades is just the full package with art and music and voice acting and interesting upgrade decisions each run.  

Slay the Spire, on the other hand, is my top turn-based game of all time. It’s the only game I’ve 100%’d as a grown adult, and I enjoyed every minute of my time with it.  

Edit: if you liked Dicey Dungeons, consider it an appetizer for the main course of Spire. Don’t worry about the art style.  

Both phenomenal games, hall of fame status for me. I haven’t played cult of the lamb."
Slay the Spire,If you like dead cells I do recommend skul: hero slayer though that's pretty much not in your list so I would also recommend slay the spire from those 3.
Slay the Spire,For me Slay the Spire. One of those games I could play forever. Hades is supposed to be amazing but I never really got into it. Cult of the Lamb is good too but maybe not as much replayability as the other two
Slay the Spire,"This comment exactly. 

Hades does have a unique method of storytelling that makes it addicting until youve exhausted the story. If you prefer fast-paced action gameplay then this is your game.

Slay the spire is a game that will stay relevant in your collection for years to come, if you like turn based strategy mixed with roguelite elements. I'd say its only better than hades because it is all game, where hades is part story and part game. The ""game"" aspect of slay the spire is better because there was no effort wasted on story."
Spelunky 2,YeS
Spelunky 2,"Yesyesyes

The game is fr really good. It is definitely challenging, you are going to die A lot. It's one of the best rogue likes you can buy right now, it is really fun playing through it and discovering secrets and mechanics

Also downwell is a really nice rogue like. You can find it on discount for like €1 and it's really fun and challenging. A neat short experience that you should check out"
Spelunky 2,Yes for the price the game has a ton of content and an incredibly fun but hard learning curve
Spelunky 2,Pc online with discord is hilarious
Spelunky 2,"Thanks guys, I got the game and it is a whole lotta fun"
Spelunky 2,Yep its so fun and replayable
Undertale,"First of all if you liked deltarune, you will love undertale. Second, this game is hilarious and the story hooks you. It is so interesting and you can just wander off sometimes if you want that extra bit of lore. Music is good, fights are fun. It’s good. Get it. Now."
Undertale,"If you liked Deltarune, then yes."
Undertale,there are also multiple endings and multiple choices
Undertale,"... with one downside...

&#x200B;

its sometimes just like hardcore"
Undertale,"I really enjoyed the game, it felt so nostalgic despite me never playing a game like it. But, I never got to finish it as I got stuck on a plot twist boss near the end, so I set it aside but then it left PS now. I wanted to rebuy it on deals but was too worried that I'd get stuck again. If you like a fun story and some challenge this game is great and the characters are likeable."
Undertale,Yeah i got the game and so far im enjoing it
Undertale,One part of hollow knight that i liked the most was that is was very hard
Undertale,Nice trust me you will be hooked
Gone Home,Days gone is a 9/10 game 100%. Probably the best zombie game I’ve ever played (I have not played The Last of Us)
Gone Home,"tl;dr: Get Days Gone if you want a traditional kind of game, story is okay I guess, fighting hordes is the main appeal to me. Also driving your motorcycle is actually kind of zen. 

Get DayZ if you want like an unstable Military-Sim adult version of Minecraft. Tons of freedom, but no story and no real main goal beyond getting cool loot and killing stuff. 

————————————-

Even as a huge fan of DayZ I can’t help but agree with the other comments. It can be very boring unless the server you are playing on has an active and welcoming community. Which generally only happens if the server is PVE only which takes a lot of the games sense of isolation and fear of being murdered over a can of beans. 

I enjoy the crap out of the modded server I play on. Basically here’s how it goes: 

New player joins server and your immediate needs are: A bag, some food, drinks and a weapon with matching ammunition and magazines. 

Then they make their way to the closest NPC Vendor spot and check out all the cool shit you can buy. So you go hit loot spots like army bases and such to grab as many guns as you can to sell to the vendors to buy better guns and maybe a vehicle to increase the amount of sellable loot you can carry, so that you can buy even better stuff. 

I mean I enjoy that gameplay loop, but I know I’m a weirdo. Helps if you have a goal in mind since the game doesn’t set any beyond “Survive.” For instance my goal is to build a stupidly nice base to house my gun collection in. And my secondary goal is to act as a first responder when other players get injured and need help. 

Also the games engine and mechanics are dodgy at best. Like you will shoot a zombie or something and watch it’s body rise into the sky like they are being raptured. Or you will be driving a car and for some reason it decides it wants to try being a plane and launches into the air or realizes it’s actually some sort of drilling machine and burrows it’s way under the map."
Gone Home,Days Gone all day.
Gone Home,"I really enjoyed days gone, I would recommend it."
Gone Home,"Are you looking to kill a bunch of zombies or are you looking for a good story and interesting game mechanics? Days Gone has some a bunch of zombie hordes that are fun to kill, but the zombies are more of a backdrop for the story than the centerpiece of the game itself. If you're looking for a story that will move you while you get good zombie game play, go with Days Gone, if you want to mow down zombies with few consequences, go with DayZ."
Gone Home,dont get dayz unless u want to jump off a bridge
Gone Home,Dayz is very boring
Gone Home,"I don't know about DayZ, but I played TLoU and Days Gone felt so close to TLoU."
Gone Home,"Very different games. Admittedly I've not played Day Z in years but it's an open world pvp sandbox game with no story. Unsure how populated servers are but it used to be fun to play with friends and you had the freedom to get up to some crazy things. Days Gone is am open world game but with a fairly linear story which when progressing opens up different phases of the game. Story is surprisingly long, but nothing spectacular. I really enjoyed the game, some or the areas are quite beautiful and I enjoyed different camps. NPC interaction outside of those for the storyline is lacking and if they had fleshed this put the game cpulshave felt a lot more immersive. I wouldn't say the game is particularly challenging outside of a few mechanics you need to pick up when encountering a new threat for the first time."
Gone Home,Days gone is one of my favorite games. Get it.
Gone Home,Days gone
Gone Home,Lol bro they're two completely different types of games
Gone Home,Why haven't you played the last of us?
Deep Rock Galactic,Can I get a rock and stone?
Deep Rock Galactic,"I've played both and it's going to depend on what kind of grind you want.

DRG is great fun with others. Go into a dig site, collect minerals, survive waves of enemies and other traps. Get out. Rinse and repeat to gain levels and gear. There's a few different classes. You slowly improve over time.

Dead cells is a bit faster paced and feels like it has more variety, but because it's fast your runs may only last a few mins. When you die, you start over. You can improve throughout the game, go deeper, harder challenges, etc. Think Hades but there's a lot more weapon choices. 

That's probably the biggest difference. DRG you get a few classes, but each class plays more or less the same. In dead cells you could have a rocking melee build, die, and find you go into traps next time. It all depends on RNG.

Also fwiw, the dlc content in DRG can all be unlocked through the game grind iirc. It's all cosmetic. Where dead cells dlc is all additional content that must be purchased."
Deep Rock Galactic,"DRG is best experienced with friends. If you know someone who will go in with you, it’s the clear winner. It’s still fun with randoms, but not a 10/10 like it is with friends. DRG is maybe my all time favorite coop game.  

Dead Cells is maybe my second favorite action roguelite, right after Hades. Tons to unlock, secrets to explore, and a high challenge level, as you unlock the more advanced difficulty settings."
Deep Rock Galactic,"It's all up to one question, are you in the mood to play alone or with people?

Drg - multiplayer
Dead cells - single 

Drg can be played solo is just more fun being a hectic drunk dwarf with friends"
Deep Rock Galactic,Deep Rock Galactic has tons of players on PlayStation.
Deep Rock Galactic,Rock and roll and stone!
Not for Broadcast,"Less of a time limit, more of a ""timeframe.""  Meaning you have to do precise things at precise times, such as, e.g., ""bleeping"" out the word ""fucking""  when a drunk politician says it during a live interview.  It can get hectic and borderline stressful, too.  One broadcast has some high school 4-member singing group singing the cringiest of songs and you have to train the camera on the group or the person singing a solo, depending on what they're actually doing in real time.  All that said, both of the above situations were really entertaining and hilarious.  There is humor throughout and it ranges from genuine lols to eyerolls.  And, of course, the way you present various things, which ads you put up during commercial breaks, etc., ultimately can play a role in how the story unfolds.  I'd say, yeah, go ahead.  

However, don't take my word for it... go ahead and try out the free demo on Steam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1201400/Not\_For\_Broadcast\_Prologue/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1201400/Not_For_Broadcast_Prologue/)"

As Dusk Falls,"I tried it, and im an avid RPG fan and didnt like it. I dunno it just felt a bit off. Wait till the new one comes out maybe."
As Dusk Falls,It's been awhile but from what I remember it was sort of like the wish version of DA Inquisition combined with The Witcher. It's not necessarily awful considering it's low budget but I did get bored about halfway through the game and moved on. If you're fine with a cheaply made janky B-list game it can be a decent RPG at a low price I occasionally see it on sale for only like $10.
As Dusk Falls,"It was on my radar for a long time and decided to finally try it out. I mean Dragon Age style game in colonial era with religious extremism and manifest destiny sounds fascinating, right? 

Ehhh...game didn't live up to it really at all. It's kind of boring, pretty barren. The gameplay is 5/10 and story/world another 5/10. I'd agree with the comments that say the game isn't bad, but its also not good. Its okay to play on a boring night you have really nothing else at all to do but beyond that you'll likely never think about it again"
As Dusk Falls,"It’s not great, but it’s not bad. You might like it. I wouldn’t get it unless you can get it deeply discounted. It was part of the ps plus packages for awhile, not sure if it still is.

Edit: didn’t notice you said Xbox, might be on gamepass."
As Dusk Falls,"My wife enjoyed it. I have three separate tries and couldn't get fully into it. Feels like a game where they were trying something, couldn't quite nail it, but will in a sequel (IF they learn from the first)"
As Dusk Falls,"I heard great things but didn't care for it. I really didn't like the look of it, and the combat was very bland from what little i played."
As Dusk Falls,"If you haven't played any of the Mass Effects, Witcher 3, Cyberpunk 2077 or Divinity Original Sins 2 I would play those first."
As Dusk Falls,It reviewed well and has it's fans but personally I gave it up after about 7-8 hours. I found it boring.
As Dusk Falls,"Greedfall is neither mainstream or worth your time. The reviews speak for themselves, if you like RPGs like dragon age, I suggest Mass Effect and other dogs with team NPCs."
As Dusk Falls,"It's got a lot of walking back and forth with nothing interesting along the way. In that regard I found it boring. However the quests in the beginning area are pretty good and you can complete them in a few different ways which is exciting. 

The boring area that the rest of the game takes place in caused me to give up on it though"
As Dusk Falls,"Got to say ""No"".

I tried it for maybe 15m, and dropped it. 

It's aggressively boring."
As Dusk Falls,"I haven’t actually played it, but as another Bioware/RPG fan, it’s been recommended me to several times. On YouTube, on the PSN store, on Steam. Finally I decided to watch the first 2 hours of someone’s let’s play of it and… it looks so bad.

“Knock off Dragon Age + The Witcher” describes it to a tee. It _feels_ cheap and like something made for the PS3 or base PS4 than anything else. The facial animations are so stiff, the world is so empty and lifeless. I’d say only get it if it’s at its cheapest sale and you genuinely have nothing else to do. 

Definitely not one I’d strongly recommend, but it scratches a “missing Bioware” itch at least the tiniest amount."
As Dusk Falls,For a game that lets you create your own MC the character creator is laughably bad. The rest just felt uninspired to me.
As Dusk Falls,"Yes. It's an underrated game with some pretty good story and gameplay. But, there are a couple of things to look out for
- the game can be janky and buggy
- some of the writing is incomplete (for eg. there are game changing storylines that have no effect on the world whatsover amd are not mentioned once after a storyline is completed)"
As Dusk Falls,"I enjoyed it, on sale I'd say its definitely worth a try. As others have said its not the greatest in terms of polish, they reuse interior assets and layout a bit, but it generally felt like a good choices matter RPG, primarily due to no morality only faction standing (example, helping free native slaves from the science group will give you points towards the natives and take away points from the science guys). The world building is fairly interesting with the different factions and there are even sub factions so an action thats positive towards the group might be negative to your faction companion. 

I know some people get upset that your character is extremely proper, as your options even when angry are well spoken but your character is nobility and acting as a diplomatic ambassador (another complaint some had, as your character often introduces themselves with their full title)."
As Dusk Falls,"Its a pretty mid game, dont go in with a lot of expectations and buy it on sale."
As Dusk Falls,"Yep, it's definetely a good choice if you are into story-driven RPG's. It might seem a little rough around the edges, but it's surely worth it's price (even more so if it is on discount)."
As Dusk Falls,"Only played for a few hours and the combat wasn't bad but it just felt so empty and lifeless. Not an awful game, there are far worse..but also far better"
As Dusk Falls,"It has some cool ideas, but executes in a very meh kinda way . It’s ok if you just wanna turn your brain off and play an RPG but artistically is kind of lacking"
As Dusk Falls,"IMO, Greedfall is what happens when a studio 1/10th the size of Bioware decides that they want to make their own version of Dragon Age Inqusition. This is Spiders' MO as a studio - they pick a project that is almost certainly too large for a studio of their size, and then they seem to be all the genuine love and effort into it that they can. This usually results in something with a lot of heart but some varied success in implementation.

They included pretty much every feature from DAI, but everything is just a little more barebones. They didn't have the budget to flesh out the world with many hours of background chatter and party banter, or to do that final QA pass that it *proooobably* needed. But everything that did make it into the game is clearly stuff that the devs *really* wanted you to see.

I think that, given this description, you might have a good idea for yourself if it's worth the money for you. And I realize I'm sounding biased, lol, but that's just because I genuinely really like Greedfall. I think it's perfectly reasonable if someone doesn't like it because they expect a higher level of polish and content from something trying to imitate a game like DAI. But I also think that there's a real audience of people who would appreciate the game despite it's jank, too."
As Dusk Falls,Played an hour and refunded. Way too janky. Good ideas but far from wonderfully executed.
As Dusk Falls,Try godfall I played it it’s quit decent
As Dusk Falls,"It goes on sale a lot, I've played it twice and really enjoyed it. I got the full version with DLC for like $15USD, I'd say it was worth 25-30. It's a much lower budget than Dragon Age, it's more like the Witcher from a narrative perspective. That said, the dialogue choices are generally pretty obvious with a few exceptions, and the combat is okay, much better on harder difficulties but super not the point of the game, just some reprieve from all the dialogue and a fun way to earn XP. 

The story, characters and atmosphere and wonderful. There are gay romance options (which is a big plus for me) and the relationships you build with party members are quite memorable. I absolutely loved the fantastical reimagining of colonial Europe and I will definitely play a third time. I think people's expectations for this game spoiled their ability to enjoy it, much like Outer Worlds for Mass Effect fans. The devs are BioWare fans, but not BioWare. Keep an open mind and I think you'll appreciate the unique experience they have to offer."
As Dusk Falls,"Yes! I enjoyed it a lot. Story is good, looks very nice, you have companions and kind of of love relathionships. You should at least try it it's a nice game in overall."
As Dusk Falls,"I think it's underrated. I'm playing on PC, BTW.

I do need to finish it - but it feels like a BioWare and CDPR type of game; like a mix b/t Witcher games and DA titles.

Combat feels very Witcher-like to me (namely W3) with some DA stuff (with that BioWare type of strategic-pause allowed and you have a party of 3). And the open-world hubs/map stuff reminds me of DAO, DA2, DAI, BG1, BG, NWN games, SW KOTOR games, Mass Effect series, etc of how you have an overhead map and travel from area-to-area.

BTW, thanks for the reminder to go work on this; I'm in the midst of Far Cry 6 and NIER: Automata."
As Dusk Falls,I got it for free and it STILL wasn't worth it
As Dusk Falls,"I played up to 8 hours before dropping. It’s a low budget open world game that unfortunately has jank like others has said. Plus I hear that building around guns is more optimal because it’s more powerful than melee & magic, so it’s not even properly balanced. I’d say pass unless your desperate to play more open world games."
As Dusk Falls,Same. It's free on PS and I tried it. Couldn't get into it at all but j heard good things. Just not for me
As Dusk Falls,Used to be on gamepass but not anymore. Goes on sale for about $10 often (its on sale currently).
As Dusk Falls,"I really liked Outer Worlds. I didn't expect a Fallout like game from it, which it wasn't, but it was still a good game in its own right."
As Dusk Falls,$10 isn’t bad. I’d say go for it. It’s not a bad game at all!
As Dusk Falls,"I bet you'd like greedfall then. It's similar in quality in a lot of ways, namely the writing and party system, though Greedfall has a much more serious tone. 
 
It excels in storytelling/lore, character relations and atmosphere. It suffers from underwhelming, clunky and easy combat, but the skill trees and powerful abilities improve it immensely as the game goes on. 
 
The level design is just like Dragon Age, you'll see a lot of inspiration from that series. Obsidian, Spyder, and BioWare seem to be birds of a feather."
Little Nightmares II,"Only played the first and absolutely loved it. I'm not a platformer guy, so it was a one and done for me, but I thoroughly enjoyed the gameplay, the aesthetic, the mood, it was just really well done. 

On top of that, the controls are a lot more fluid than I was expecting for a platformer, at points it almost felt a bit Prince of Persia-y, except without the wallrunning stuff.

If it's cheapy cheap, it's worth the cash for the few hours you'll get out of it"
Little Nightmares II,"If you haven't seen all of it for example you don't know the endings or maybe 50% of what happens in the game I would say it's definitely worth it. For a game that doesn't use words it does a really good job telling the story and building lore. It's a mix between horror, puzzle, adventure. my advice is to try the little nightmares 2 demo on steam and if you like it go for it. I know what the game is about but not the demo so I'm assuming it'll give you a section of the game to play for a little bit and I don't see it on sale for steam so Idk if it's on sale on another website or the sale ended but if it ended steam is having a summer sale in a week or less hope this helps."
Little Nightmares II,"I'm from Europe and the first game with the dlcs are 7,99 euros"
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,all im gonna say is theres a 2 hour free trial before you refund. so try it out before 2 hours and then decide
Squad 51 vs. the Flying Saucers,"Probably the smart idea, thanks"
Night in the Woods,"So for the controversy, the guy is dead so he isn't benefiting from your purchase or at least that's how I see it.

I do love this game and it hit me quite hard when I played it as I really related to some of the characters. Gameplay wise expect to walk around the town, talk to people a lot, figure out its secrets, and play some fairly simple but quick mini games. In the end, you are coming to this game for the narrative and for that it is well written and has a nice pace that doesn't linger too long while letting you engage by giving some minor choices to make in dialogue and how you approach your friend group. I'd say it reminds me of Oxenfree but far more grounded (despite you playing a cat) in its story even if it does delve into some otherworldly stuff. 

Hope that helps"
Night in the Woods,Never played it but someone told me it was really good
Night in the Woods,[removed]
Night in the Woods,I’m not familiar with the controversy but I loved the game. The characters and the writing really cut deep. It has a lot of heart.
Night in the Woods,"Absolutely, especially if you’re young and have had trouble finding what to do with your life or have struggled with mental illness. 

NITW has kinda become a Halloween tradition for me. It’s one of my favorite games. It is very light on gameplay, but its story is breathtakingly beautiful."
Night in the Woods,"R.I.P. Alec Howolka, man"
Night in the Woods,[removed]
Night in the Woods,"That is not what I mean, he was the victim of the controversy and at least some of the dev team of this game is responsible for it

I wouldn’t mind the gameplay tho"

Night in the Woods,"It actually made me stop for a sec. Are you trading games you played and enjoyed, or are these that you don't want to play?

All i want to say is that NitW is at the end of the day, a niche experience in a niche genre. Little to no gameplay can alienate a lot of people"
Night in the Woods,I literally said that i don't want to do it but alright
Night in the Woods,"Both, some I owned but didn’t necessarily enjoy, they’re all from bundles

I’ll check a few reviews before buying, although I think I did play and enjoy similar games, which games you know of are closest to this game?"
Night in the Woods,"Did you play Firewatch? I'd say that substituting thriller for sadness can kind of make it similar. Also, Undertale, but without battles is also similar."
Night in the Woods,Not Firewatch but I did play Undertale without battles
Night in the Woods,"I mean, if you remove battle system altogether. Just walk around, talk to people kind of thing"
Transistor,"I'd definitely recommend it. It's like a mix between turn based and real time combat, you can get several new moves and can set them as active attacks or passive buffs while also playing around with combining some of them. The aesthetic is beautiful and the soundtrack is top notch."
Transistor,[deleted]
Transistor,"At that price it’s a steal. The music, the art style, the gameplay, it’s all wonderful. It’s a cool blend of action and strategy unlike any other (not hyper). It’s a wonderful wonderful game."
Transistor,"I liked it, I played it when it was free on PlayStation plus a while back. I liked the balance of turn based and action combat. Made the game interesting and replayable. Definitely worth $4."
Transistor,It's very short. Took me like 6 hours to beat but was an amazing game. I bought it for 10$-15$ and it was worth it. There are some games that I won't play even if free.
Transistor,It's a great game. My favorite part was the soundtrack and the story. I actually bought the soundtrack and still listen to it and it's been years since I finished it.
Transistor,"Gorgeus game. Bastion is so beatiful too. If you can, buy it"
Transistor,Tysm! I ended up getting it! Loving it so far!
Transistor,"Okay, thank you so much!"
Transistor,Tysm!
Transistor,"Okie dokie, ty!"
Transistor,Thanks!
Transistor,Tysm! :)
Transistor,Let me know what you think of it!
Transistor,I absolutely loved the graphics and aesthetics. The gameplay is relatively easy but the powerups/moves add an awesome element. Great game! Thanks for your help!!!
Darkest Dungeon,"I think Slay the Spire is probably a safer recommendation, or if you want something without the card-based gameplay, Star Renegades is basically turn based JRPG + roguelite, with some nice mechanics in there. Not sure which is on which system, but I have almost 400 hours in Slay the Spire and it’s great to play in short bursts or as your “main game” like I have for a lot of the past year."
Darkest Dungeon,"I’m absolutely garbage at strategy games, but I’ve been able to beat darkest dungeon and had a great time doing so. I played it on easy, kept the torch high, looked up things, and over leveled for bosses. It didn’t provide anywhere near the high of beating sword saint, but it’s a lot of fun. And if you think you’ll like the narrator, you’ll really like it. It’s excellently done. 

I know it isn’t your flair but if you have an iPad I think it was only $10 which may be easier to swing to just check something out."
Darkest Dungeon,"Definitely not, man. This game is tough as nails, and it's one of those games that gets harder and more punishing the deeper you go. It's a definite aesthetic choice and some people really like it for this, but for folks like you and me who aren't super great at strategy (but can enjoy action games with tough learning curves), it's just going to give you more to manage and more to worry about and less to work with as you go. I don't think it's going to be up your alley. It definitely wasn't up mine."
Darkest Dungeon,"you LIKE the narrator?

apparently calling a torch immeasurable riches payed for with blood is funny"
Darkest Dungeon,"Darkest Dungeon allows players to tweak a lot of stuff through different gameplay settings as well as player choices. You can play at a lower difficulty level, or keep the difficulty normal and play safe (but slow). Most of the game is balanced around the normal difficulty and default gameplay settings, so tweaking it too much might result in you just ripping through enemies without much effort, but if you're mostly in it for the experience, I would recommend it. 

I would not compare the difficulty or experience to Sekiro since Sekiro is completely balanced around player skill and reflexes, while DD will screw you with bad RNG at critical moments. Your party members dying/going insane is a part of the experience, and no matter how good you are at decision-making, you cannot entirely avoid shitty rolls. The major decisions happen outside combat - do you want a balanced party, or do you want glass cannons? Do you just want to do a suicide run so you can get more treasure? Do you want to explore the entire dungeon, or just complete the objective and gtfo? You can play cautiously and still get to experience the game well."
Florence,RDR2 is an absolute triumph. It MUST be played.
Florence,"I would generally recommend RDR2, which is one of the best games ever made.

Presentation is absolutely stunning across the board. Graphics, SFX, music, voice acting, all are absolutely stellar.

Gameplay-wise is also phenomenal. Essentially, to summarise, it plays as a 3rd-person shooter, with some RPG and simulation elements - it really shines in making you *feel* like the character you're playing as, that is, a cowboy in the late 19th/early 20th century, with all the gambling, outlawing, hunting, etc.

The content available is frankly some of the best value in any videogame. This is the most well-realised open-world game ever, in my estimation - an immersive world that feels natural and alive, that exists independently of you but reacts to your decisions. The story is fully fleshed out, dramatic, personal and intimate, but also self-aware enough to shine all the wild west tropes through. You have further an entire online mode that I haven't even touched yet.

When considering the preferences you laid out, I'm even more convinced you'll enjoy it. I'd recommend it over cyberpunk to anyone, but even more to someone with your preferences."
Florence,"RDR2 is probably the better made game but I also loved Cyberpunk, it’s story, and it felt very creative and new. I liked someone else’s idea of doing RDR2 and buy Cyberpunk when DLC comes out so you can transition straight to DLC"
Florence,"Love both, but I’d start with RDR2 buddy. And just know, it’ll be awhile before you start Cyberpunk once you get immersed into that work and Aruthur"
Florence,U can miss cyberpunk. U cant pass on RDR2! Easy as that
Florence,"Rdr2 without a doubt. The most beautiful open world, lots of chill out time, lots of random and very well written scripted quests, a sense of history with a bit of the absurd, and a tragic crime family story. It will give you a thrill, make you feel like a badass, and then leave you in tears."
Florence,"I’m sure there will be a Complete Edition for Cyberpunk/Phantom Liberty, so wait on that. Cyberpunk was great; loved the story, Night City and the RPG elements. Granted I played on PS5 when that version was released. 

Red Dead Redemption II is one of the greatest games ever made. Five years later and it’s still worth full price. The quantity and quality of content is impressive."
Florence,RDR2
Florence,"As someone that was super hyped cyberpunk and hit it day 1, as faulty and buggy as it was at the time on my ps4, I enjoyed it, and now 100 times better with the next gen update and all on my ps5, that being said, RDR2 was one of the best games of the last generation, and it plays great on next gen consoles… definitely recommend RDR2, it’s not an rpg but getting lost in that world and along with the things you discover in it are very rpg like to me, definitely recommend RDR2"
Florence,"RDR2.

Cyberpunk is cool, but it will be much cooler in a few months with the update/remake

I also would only get cyberpunk if you have at least a PS5/next gen/pc"
Florence,Red dead redemption until cyberpunk dlc is released
Florence,"No question, RDR2 all the way!"
Florence,"I feel like RDR2 is a much better overall game, but is more divisive than you would be lead to believe. It's a slow burn story game, so if you're cool with that, it's way better.

Cyberpunk is exactly as you expect it to look and feel."
Florence,"Cyberpunk base game is also been a lot of improvements when the DLC releases so get cyberpunk then with the DLC, for now its time for RDR2 Boah!!"
Florence,RDR2
Florence,RDR2 without a doubt
Florence,"Red dead, even though I mostly play rpgs. Even though it’s fairly polished now I just find Cyberpunk to be boring. Idk I hope someday I can engage with it but it’s not now."
Florence,"RDR2

Cyberpunk is also a very good game, and I do recommend you play it eventually

But with the DLC just around the corner (only three months away in fact) you should wait until it releases before getting it"
Florence,"Wait for the DLC and play RDR2 while you wait. I personally liked Cyberpunk more, but RDR2 is amazing aswell."
Florence,"Rdr2 and I liked both of them, but RDR2 is on another level"
Florence,Rdr2
Florence,"RDR2 is the most polished game I have ever played. The environments are highly-interactive and the world with it’s animals and people respond to you and each other in a very believable way. It’s story is an engaging epic action-drama grounded in reality. It’s extremely immersive.

CP2077 had very rough beginnings and, when I last played it late last year, that roughness still shows through on what otherwise feels like quite a nice game. Everyone knows about the bugs, so there’s no point mentioning them more here.  The physical environments and sound design are very well set up. But the NPCs populating the world will behave in ways that might break your immersion. When a gun is fired, they will all crouch in the same animation and despawn as soon as you aren’t looking. Police will spawn in on top of you when you commit a crime and don’t put up any chase when you flee. Feels disappointing in a world constructed around the notion of constant police-gang struggle. Supposedly this is slated to be reworked in the future.
The world has some interactivity more on par with games like dishonored 2. Dialogue feels particularly strong and the story is, in my experience, engaging. 
One strange thing is the character customisation. One premise of the world building is ‘fashion over function’. How you look is supposedly as important as how you act on the world of 2077. But this is totally at odds with the actual game mechanics. You will be heavily encouraged to wear clothes for their stats, not their appearance, and that will lead to some pretty weird costume combos. It doesn’t matter much because the game is entirely first person perspective, but that begs the (controversial?) question of why have a player model at all."
Florence,Yes red dead redemption is much better on many levels right off the bat.
Florence,Rdr2
Florence,"Rdr2 100%. In my opinion it’s the best/most realistic video game ever made. The only downside is it’s ruined every game I’ve played after it. Either the graphics look terrible, the story is dumb, gaming mechanics aren’t as good etc.."
Florence,"Hands down, RDR2. While I enjoyed Cyberpunk for what it is, I don't think that's a close call by almost any metric."
Florence,"Red Dead Redemption 2 by far; I 100% Cyberpunk 2077, I did not 100% Red Dead.  Cyberpunk doesn't not have a lot of depth, unfortunately, its presentation is good and certainly has gotten better since launch but literally the only time I would even talk about it in the same breath as RDR2 is a question like yours, in terms of quality and depth and content, it doesn't hold a candle to RDR2.

There is of course a difference in setting to consider, but just keep in mind that while the 'cyberpunk' aesthetic is certainly present in Cyberpunk 2077, I'd argue it doesn't even do it as well as games like Shadowrun for SNES or Shadowrun for Genesis.  That may seem harsh, but again I did everything you could do in this game, it really doesn't have much going for it."
Florence,RDR2
Florence,"I would wait for the the dlc for Cyberpunk as it seems it will be some kind of mega side quest and will bring improvements to the base game as well, rdr2 is hit or miss I guess depending on people, it's a slow paced game but amazing visuals, story and immersion but with that said I finished cyberpunk and still will come back for the dlc, the game has a pretty big replayability if you like trying different approach to combat"
Florence,"If you don't mind a slow burn for massive payoff then go for RDR2. You'll want to wait to play CP2077 until Phantom Liberty releases as they're doing an overhaul of the base game too.

Edit: Liberty not Pain"
Florence,RDR2
Florence,"No, it's not Next-Gen Optimized, but still RDR2 all day every day"
Florence,"RDR2 is the superior game in my opinion. Cyberpunk is pretty bland in comparison. However, Cyberpunk has better performance in that, it can run at 60 fps on next- gen consoles (whereas RDR2 is locked at 30 fps) and is better optimized on PC, though still expect bugs. Also, RDR2 can be overwhelming with its size and detail, Cyberpunk is much smaller in scale."
Florence,RDR 2 if you like a beautiful masterpiece
Florence,"I just started RD2 on PC about a week ago and it’s absolutely sensational.

I do plan on getting CP after the new DLC comes out tho, and after I finish the main story in RD2!"
Florence,You like computers or cowboys?
Florence,"Seems like they’re going to add lots of fixes to the new gen consoles version of cyberpunk along with the expansion, so I think you should play RDR2 until a much better version of cyberpunk is out."
Florence,RDR2.
Florence,Red Dead Redemption 2
Florence,"Wait for the Dlc of Cyberpunk, the game will get a massive overhaul with it"
Florence,"RDR2 is the most polished game I have ever played. The environments are highly-interactive and the world with it’s animals and people respond to you and each other in a very believable way. It’s story is an engaging epic action-drama grounded in reality. It’s extremely immersive.

Florence,Red Dead 2
Florence,RDR2 duh. CP2077 world and setting is unlike anything I've seen before so that's why I liked it but the story and gameplay was just ok to me.
Florence,"RD2 

Wait for cyberpunks expansion and then get it. It’s a good game on its own. Think Skyrim but in a cyberpunk setting. Yes is failed on some major systems they were supposed to have. Supposedly they are reworking a ton which will drop with the new expansion in September"
Florence,Red Dead. Definitely Red Dead.
Florence,RDR 2 hands down!
Florence,rdr2 for sure!
Florence,Rdr2
Florence,"I might get some hate, but i enjoyed cyberpunk way more than i did rdr2. Maybe rdr2 was too tedious for me, or i didnt like the setting so much. Not sure, still a masterpiece though. 
Still id get cp2077"
Florence,Red Dead Redemption 2
Florence,RDR2. By a mile!
Florence,"There has recently (as in, this weekend) been an article about the Cyberpunk DLC. Along side it is an overall of almost every system. The state its in now, Cyberpunk is *fine.* The open world feels so dead and empty, with nothing ever changing. You can stand and watch a NPC for 5 hours, and they will not move from there spot. The gunplay is fantastic, and the story is good, although that's of course subjective) I think part of that will be changing, along with the many other little tweaks they will be making, along side adding the DLC. So I would hold off. 

&#x200B;

RDR2, in contrast is amazing. The story, combat, graphics are wonderful and I don't have much bad to say about the game. My only complaint is the pacing of the story. It drags on a little to much, but at the same time, that's kind of the point? So It seems a weird complaint. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, TL;DR- Buy RDR2, Hold of on Cyberpunk until the DLC is released"
Florence,Red dead 2. That game is forever in my heart
Florence,"If you like RPG games, go for cyberpunk. But if you want an experience go for RDR2. Many people say that rdr2 doesn’t have a good story, but I believe that it is amazing. But I think everyone will agree that rdr2 has the best protagonist of all time, Arthur Morgan."
Florence,[deleted]
Florence,"It took me almost 70h to complete the main story in RDR2 that is without any side missions or free roaming.

Done the cyberpunk main story a lot of side quests and done some free roaming all under 50h"
Florence,Both are great but I'd wait for Cyberpunk fixes and qol that come with the expansion so RDR2 first
Florence,"RDR2 is probably the better made game but I also loved Cyberpunk, it’s story, and it felt very creative and new. I liked someone else’s idea of doing RDR2 and buy Cyberpunk when DLC comes out so you can transition straight to DLC"
Florence,"I completed cyberpunk 3x with lowered graphics and shit fps. (Roll on phantom liberty with a 3080)

I didnt finish RDR2s first? Second? Act.

Dont get me wrong, I think RDR2 is an amazing game, probably the better one, but these are the facts lol."
Florence,Rdr2.  Then In September you can get CP when it gets somewhat overhauled by developers
Florence,Why is that even a question? RDR2 should be the default answer to this.
Florence,Get both honestly. They are both masterpieces of games. I personally enjoy Cyberpunk a lot more but they are both fantastic in terms of story and gameplay.
Florence,Cp 2077
Florence,"I'd go with RDR2 first and, depending on how much free time you have, by the time you're done with it there'll probably be some version of Cyberpunk with Phantom Liberty included. Either way you'll have a great time with both, enjoy!"
Florence,"I admit that rdr2 is the better made game,  I just got bored by it.  Cyberpunk was way more fun and engaging to me. I played on a pretty good pc, and didn't really have any expectations going into the game,  so I wasn't soured by anything.

Rockstar games kinda just bore me tbh. After playing the ps2 gta games to death,  any Rockstar game after just feels like it plays the exact same."
Florence,I love Cyberpunk and never had bug issues. You should 100% get red dead as it’s probably the best game ever created.
Florence,Red Dead Redemption 2 is already a complete game. Cyberpunk still needs polishing and should be even more solid after the expansion comes out in September. RDR2 will hold you until then.
Florence,"if u have a series console, ps5, or high end pc, get cyberpunk for 30$ plus the expansion for another 30$. if u don't have that, then id say RDR2"
Florence,"Have both and played both.  
RDR2 is super immersive and so finely tuned - but it is an open world Rockstar game so it's going to be a bit overwhelming, at least it was to me.  
Cyberpunk is also open world but a bit more linear.  It has that Skyrim like maneuverability where things can get wonky but it allows the player more freedom. 

I'd say go for cyberpunk and just play it now so you have an understanding of the game and story before the dlc comes out."
Florence,"I have both.

Cyberpunk is more of RPG style than RDR2. There's skill points and such to distribute. RDR2 increases stats for you based on what you do.

Cyberpunk's AI have health bars, red dead's doesn't. It's more immersive for that reason.

RDR2 is much slower pace, but has a lot more to explore. The scenery can be breath-taking and sometimes hard to fathom how good it looks. 

Cyberpunk has a lot of nothing, but it still looks pretty cool. Nice graphics.

So far, I like cyberpunk's story but it can seem a bit all over the place.

RDR2 has been easier to follow."
Florence,"If you just want a decent story with an immersive world and nice graphics, RDR2 is fine for that. It has pretty terrible gameplay, and it's a brain-dead easy game that treats players like they have 60 IQ. If you just want to turn off your brain for 60-hours and play through a decent story, then it fits the bill. Especially if you like the wild west and spaghetti western movies, then you will probably like RDR2. 

Cyberpunk has way better art direction than RDR2, but the game is severely lacking in terms of a lot of its open world systems. It has nowhere near as immersive of an open world as RDR2. The setting and visuals are a lot cooler, but the actual execution isn't there. The combat is not very good, but it's at least better than RDR2 in this area. It also has RPG systems and build variety which RDR2 doesn't have. Overall I'd say just wait until the DLC drops, because apparently they have reworked a lot of aspects of the game. CP2077 really does have a lot of potential, so if the DLC lives up to the hype, then it could be a game changer."
Florence,I just tried cyberpunk a couple weeks ago off a freinds familyshare and its still super buggy to the point where i wound up getting fed up with the bugs and uninstalling. I would have felt very cheated if it was a game i payed for. So i would go with RDR2
Florence,"Everyone says RDR2 is the best game ever, but the janky controls are super frustrating and honestly it’s pretty slow at times. I don’t need to watch long animations every time I pick something up or do anything. It’s more cowboy sim than game. 

Tried it 3 times and never make it past 10 hrs or so."
Florence,[deleted]
Florence,Both
Florence,Mount a blade bannerlord has great rpg mechanics you can literally be anything in that world
Florence,I would only choose Cyberpunk solely because it has next gen support. RDR2 is a fantastic game but lacks that kind of support which makes me personally not touch it ever since I beat it back in 2018.
Florence,"RDR2. It’s a much more immersive game and story. Cyberpunk is a great game too, but I don’t find the story as good at all. The pros about cyberpunk are extreme weapon customization and playstyle customization with perk trees. When I play RDR2 I feel like I’m in the story, and when I play Cyberpunk I feel like I’m in a gigantic beautiful sandbox game."
Florence,Cyberpunk
Florence,"RDR2 is much more story rich and interactive compared to cyberpunk. It only takes around 30 hours to complete the main mission, spoiler alert ( when doing the last mission after doing so you get back to prior of starting the last mission to finish anything else to basically you don't fully finish it). It has nice features, ray tracing, and a nice environment, but RDR2 beats it in every other way. That's from my opinion as i have both and played both for 100 hours plus on each."
Florence,"Cyberpunk has better writing and combat. Rdr2's world is more detailed, alive and polished. 
I prefer cyberpunk.
Most people seem to prefer rdr2."
Florence,"RDR2. Ive played both and Cyberpunk really lacks in a lot of areas and i didn’t get much enjoyment from it after completing the main story line. RDR2 however is a game that ive replayed numerous times and spent upwards of 400 hours combined playing, most of it in free roam. Havent even touched the online yet."
Florence,"Cyberpunk's DLC will remain as a DLC, it seems to be set in a new city, but at this point, nothing can be done about the game's dullness and how unfun it is to play. I played it for 25 hours(right until the 3-race side mission were unlocked), and it's just boring, the plot is mediocre, the fighting, the gameplay are subpar, the only redeeming thing was how beautiful everything looked, and that's it"
Florence,I would be cautious with RDR2 on PC. I had to get a refund on it due to the game constantly crashing; the issues had to do specifically with the Rockstar games launcher which you are required to use.
Florence,"Rdr2 is a bit of an ancient game in terms of design. Missions force you to do things one way and if you don’t listen the game fails you. It’s also an aggressively easy game that just feels stiff and clunky mechanics wise. It’s got great voice acting, but I found the world and story pretty dull. Cyberpunk is a far more enjoyable game that gives you choices on how to handle each mission with much better combat and a much more interesting world to explore and a far more interesting story."
Florence,"This is a hard one, gotta do both haha"
Florence,neither buy rain world 😈😈
Florence,RDR2 no contest
Florence,"Depends, if you're on console I would skip RDR2, it still runs at 30FPS, rockstar doesn't care about next gen update."
Florence,"Neither, buy doom eternal"
Florence,I dont like rdr2 at all and like project red games
Florence,Cyberpunk. Red dead 2 is overrated imo
Florence,They’re both great go with what interests you more.
Florence,I've played both and I have some stronger critiques on RD2 than most but would still pick it over CP.
Florence,"Both games are amazing, i loved Cyberpunk it's story characters, scenery. currently playing RDR2 its really good, both games are great. I'd buy both if i were u"
Florence,Robots and guns or cowboys and guns
Florence,"I’d go for Cyberpunk personally. The game is really good as long as you take your time and do the side quests. There are a ton of really compelling stories that get told. I’d wait to play until Phantom Liberty releases though. The gameplay is already good, but it’s rumored they’re going to be shipping big improvements to key systems like the AI and the police systems (and possibly more) with the DLC."
Florence,I recommend getting both
Florence,"Both are incredible story games, depends on what you want. If you care about story and characters, go red dead, if you care about combat and replay ability go cyberpunk"
Florence,"Rdr2, 100000%"
Florence,Cyberpunk if you want action. Red dead if you don't mind watching a movie in game format.
Florence,Rdr2 cyberpunk has a lot of problems
Florence,RDR2
Florence,Red dead partner!
Florence,Red Dead is the better game hands down.
Florence,RDR2
Florence,Do you want to be a cowboy? If so…follow your heart
Florence,Cyberpunk has a big DLC coming soon.
Florence,"With the Phantom Liberty expansion, which overhaul all of cyberpunk. It will great to buy...


But RDR2 is a moderm masterpiece so it gets my vote"
Florence,"Cyberpunk is more action and adrenaline, Red Dead Redemption 2 is more laid back and slow-paced.  


Cyberpunk has been getting updates continually since release and is awesomely upgraded by this point...I never finished RDR2, but I finished Cyberpunk and am waiting at the edge of my seat for Phantom Liberty, which is going to be a *huge* DLC and should be later this year.  


Cyberpunk.  My two cents."
Florence,"RDR2, it's much more detailed and alive rather than cyberprank, tho I enjoyed cyberprank (played from friend's console) its just not within the same level of RDR2 also the balancing of story telling and action on RDR2 is peak unlike in cyberpunk you're always just sitting and listening"
Florence,I don’t usually post on reddit but i just want to make sure that you get RDR2
Florence,"Both are great, but I think Cyberpunk is the more engaging game. Red Dead suffers from the antiquated Rockstar game design. Almost no freedom during missions, you’re just railroaded through each section and must play it as the developers intend."
Florence,Red dead 2 is my pick. Cyberpunk was fun but i can’t just sit back and enjoy the world like i can with RDr2
Florence,"In my opinion, Red Dead Redemption 2 was an incredible experience, especially in the beginning and middle game. However, I found myself getting bored after reaching around 60% completion, as there weren't many new things to explore once I had acquired the best weapon. 

On the other hand, Cyberpunk had superior writing and enjoyable gameplay, but it did suffer from some noticeable bugs."
Florence,"RDR2 and anyone who says diff is crazy ive completed both games and theres just nothing that compares to RDR2 everything about it is so amazing but for me my fav thing about the game was the story telling. the best storytelling ive ever experienced in a game hands down. it could of been a oscar winning film. i literally cryed during a few scenarios in the game,"
Florence,Lol EASY choice. RDR2.
Florence,Are you on pc ? If you don’t wanna keep the games forever. I can tell you how to get them for like 2$ both on steam
Florence,"I vote rdr, as well. BUT, if you haven't played Witcher 3, that's another great one. Plus, it often heavily discounted."
Florence,RDR2 and its not even close
Florence,"Red dead 2. There isn’t a game that has immersed me more than this game, I play butt nekkid and pretend I’m a O’Driscol. 10 Cowboys out of 10"
Florence,"I’ve played both and loved both, but I fully believe that RDR2 is truly the best game ever, go with that first!"
Florence,"Rdr2 is very pretty and has some interesting things in it but from a gameplay perspective it's unbelievably barren. You don't even get to aim your gun in this game really and all the missions are basically ""walk here, listen to dialogue, kill guys"".

Cyberpunk at least has some depth to combat. It's a passable first person shooter. Not a great one mind you, but it works. The missions here are also just ""walk here, listen to dialogue, kill guys"".

Personally the dialogue in both these games puts me to sleep and that's like 70% of both. But I guess I would say the Rdr2 dialogue at least feels finished, whereas the cyberpunk dialogue very frequently feels like a placeholder."
Florence,RDR 2 is a no brainer in this case
Florence,"Cyberpunk over RDR2. While RDR2 is a great game, i found it slow, and alot of the “immersive” mechanics being pretty surface level and just boring. Unpopular take, but Cyberpunk is more fun."
Florence,I’d wait till the new expansion for CP2077 comes out. It’s supposed to bring a whole bunch of QOL changes to the base game.
Florence,RDR2
Florence,No
Florence,"RDR2 was fun, but I was more hyped for Cyberpunk 2077. Ended up not caring for RDR2 so much after burning myself out on it, but Cyberpunk absolutely failed me in almost every department. RDR2 is the way to go."
Florence,"Wait for the cyberpunk dlc to drop before you buy since they are redoing A LOT of the mechanics. I believe it’s September 26 so you have a lot of time to finish red dead. Plus the summer sale is soonish I think so you might be able to get the game and dlc for cheap depending on what price they set. 

I’ve played both and even though it’s been a while since I played cyberpunk and I just finished red dead 3 days ago both are excellent games in their own right but I’d probably play red dead before cyberpunk."
Florence,**\*\*\* me scrolling through the comments to find the crazy psychopath that chooses cyberpunk over rdr2 \*\*\***
Florence,Cyberpunk is fun but it doesn’t come close to RDR2.
Florence,"It depends on what type of games you like, red dead is more story based and polished, but cyberpunk is more ""fuck around and break the game"", but in a good way

Cyberpunk has leveling and a skill tree, and rdr doesn't, so I think you'd like it more

Also red dead was built with miracles or something because it runs like a dream"
Florence,[removed]
Florence,Both games are really good but RDR2 is my favourite game all time so pick RDR2
Florence,"Both are great, but RDR2 is looong but with lots of content"
Florence,Rdr2
Florence,Cyberpunk is more fun. RDR2 gets crazy tedious
Florence,"Red Dead 2 is worth its weight in gold. The story is perfectly told, with some of the best voice acting I've ever heard in a video game. The world is vast, and you never feel like you're completely out of things to do. Bored of missions? Hunt some animals for upgrades to both your player or your camp. Tired of hunting? Put your criminal mind to robbing a store or train. Want to help the law? Check the local sheriff's office for a bounty. The list of activities goes on and on...


So to answer your question, take a break from the cybernetics and neon signs of Night City and go on a breathtaking journey through late 1800's America with Dutch Van der Linde and the gang!"
Florence,"Go with red dead and play cyberpunk after the last dlc comes out. There will probably some sale for a definitive edition down the line.

Both games are definitely worth to be played."
Florence,Do you prefer cowboys or cyborgs
Florence,Finished Rdr2 3 times already and would pay 200$to forget everything and start the game again without remembering anything. Cyberpunk I enjoyed the story but the game was full of bugs and lost the interest of playing it again even if it is fixed or not
Florence,"I played red dead 2 after it had been out for like 4 years not expecting much. I didn't even buy it, I played my brothers copy, that's the only reason I tried it. It turned out to be my favorite game ever. I'm not particularly interested in the wild west. It felt like watching a movie in the best way possible. It's the only game I can think of where I was sad because I knew it was ending soon. I can't recommend it enough.

I was excited for cyberpunk for years. I was incredibly disappointed when I finally was able to play it, I put about 20 hours in it and feel no urge to continue playing it. Even after they've patched it."
Florence,"All you need to do is listen to the song ""Video games"" by Tenacious D. You're welcome."
Florence,RDR2. Cyberpunk's getting totally reworked head to toe alongside new DLC in September and *that's* when you should buy it.
Florence,RDR2
Florence,rdr2
Florence,RDR2!
Florence,Hmph. Rdr2 is a masterpiece. Cyberpunk quite literally is bad. Phantom liberty sounds very promising on paper but we’ll have to see. So did this game pre release and I’d give it a 5/10.
Florence,Is this post by OP a joke?
Florence,RDR2
Florence,"Rdr2 has a much stronger plot and cast. And the world is gorgeous.

Cyberpunk is also fantastic and a lot of fun, BUT it’s a lot more you having to role play the character"
Florence,"Loved both, but like everyone has already said, start with RDR2. CP2077 is a fantastic game, but it will get better once the Phantom Liberty update comes out."
Florence,Rdr2 all day. By far my fav game all time.. online sux d tho.
Florence,I couldn't get into RDR2 personally. I was enjoying the story and it's the most beautiful game ever made but I thought the gameplay and controls were so rudimentary I stopped at Chapter 3. Meanwhile I really liked Cyberpunk especially the story and although its gameplay isn't groundbreaking it didn't stop me from finishing the game.
Florence,"Red dead, no doubt."
Florence,RDR2 is one of the best games humanity has ever witnessed
Florence,"Most people are saying RD2, but my vote is for Cyberpunk. Bugs aren't as bad now, and the story is great. Along with a bunch of different builds. You can be a ninja with a katana, a run and gun madman, or a tech savvy hacker. The atmosphere is great and helps tie everything together, and the characters you meet really make it amazing. Just like all of CDPR's games, they really go all out with side quests and side story characters. Plus, Phantom Liberty releases in September, so if it's on sale, I would go for it. Cyberpunk is by far one of my favorites, and honestly, RD2 doesn't even get close to my top games.
That being said, both Cyberpunk and RD2 are both amazing games. I just lean more towards Cyberpunk."
Florence,"I say pick up Cyberpunk, it might be worthwhile to play the game now, with the original story, before playing Phantom Liberty. As Phantom Liberty is very likely going to come with some new endings, and possibly some other changes outside the ones we already know.

Plus I just think its a good game, well worth the money nowadays after 1.5. Mods make it even more fun to play around with. Just an entertaining experience.

On top of that Cyberpunk is truly an RPG, it lets you choose your skills, pick different perks, use different weapons. You truly build your character the way you want. Its very similar to thinks likeSkyrim in that way. Where as Red Dead 2 is just the same character no matter what, there is no leveling system or anything. Its really more of an action adventure title than a true RPG. 

So if you want to get immersed into an RPG and its setting, in similar fashion to things like Skyrim, I recommend 2077."
Florence,RDR2 with no hesitation and do not read spoilers.
Florence,"Hey unpopular opinion time. I played both.

RDR2 is certainly a marvel. The story is amazing, graphics are second to none, the protagonist is probably the most well flushed out I've ever experienced in a game, and overall the game really is a must play.

....but it's a bit of a drag yeah? It's very slow paced, and I found myself just wanting to play other games from time to time. This isn't really a negative point, and is definitely subjective, but man it can DRAG. 



Cyberpunk (post patches) is a wild ride. The story is a blast, and really kicks. The set pieces are way above what I expected in an open world game. The side quests, as expected from CDPR are just as good, if not better than the main story in many cases. Definitely a case of art direction trumping graphical fidelity. While it doesn't look bad by any stretch... Walking though Chinatown in the middle of the night is a sight to behold. Vibrant neon lighting, crowded streets, some guy getting mugged in an alley, the constant cacophony of people shouting and talking... I haven't felt that level of immersion in a game... Maybe ever.

Yeah it's a bit of a mess. But way better than the sum of its parts. Unfortunately I listened to the online griping, and missed out for longer than necessary, but take from someone who was hesitant, it blew me away.

At the end of the day Cyberpunk is just ***fun***. The shooting is chunky and effective, the driving is arcady but feels good, the plot and characters are fucking bonkers, and there really are just so many ways to play the game.

I played it the first time as a learning curve. A little hacking, a little shotgun, a little melee. It was pure chaos and really felt like I was a newbie in night city trying to climb to the top.

Second time thru and I'm playing full stealth. Feels like a totally different game. I walk in an alley, activate my speed implant, turn invisible, and walk through putting a bullet in everyone's head. Come out the other side, and watch the bodies drop before the cameras ever had a chance to catch me. Suddenly I felt like an elite level assassin that was born and bred in this world.


You can't go wrong either way, but I tip towards CP"
Florence,"cyberpunk, rdr2 is a linear game in an open world setting with the most boring chapter 1 in existence, also everything you do (pointless animation) is so slow and infuriating that you can fall asleep"
Florence,I think rdr2 has more replayability if that matter to you as far as stretching your dollar. I dont find myself excitingly opening cyberpunk. I felt like 1 playthrough was enough to get a big grasp of the game.
Florence,"Rdr2 is a masterpiece. It’s slow paced but if you adapt your speed to it, rather than trying to force it to your speed, it’s fantastic! It is the most alive environment of any game I’ve played. Can interact with just about everything too. And npc’s actually seem like they are more than objects moving around the screen."
Florence,RDR2 is one of the greatest games ever made.
Florence,"I have both. The answer is both. Just get both, play them both for less than two-hours each, and refund the one you don’t want."
Florence,"Unquestionably RDR2 is the better, more fully realized game. 

I think the best question to answer from a prospective standpoint, however, is what is your preferred gaming experience? Do you like 'slow' as a concept? Do you enjoy being diverted from whatever you initially planned doing? If a game world is both fun and immersive, are you happy with killing an hour or two wandering around it and not focusing on story progression? If yes to all of the above, You will love RDR2. If you are very task oriented and want everything to be a quick hit, then RDR2 isn't going to be your cup of tea regardless of its (excellent) level of quality.

That's generally what people mean when they say this game is divisive. The less patient get frustrated with its deliberateness."
Florence,Wait until the Cyberpunk expansion comes out at a discount. It will probably be in its best state at that point.
Florence,"Red Dead 2 all the way. It took me like 3 attempts of replaying the beginning before I finally got hooked on the game and I wish it didn’t cause I’ve been missing out! 

It’s such a beautiful game. The guns are dope, (just experiment, you can’t lose unless you don’t like the gun which you can just store away) and the world is vast but alive

Like you’ll suddenly get ambushed or some fools will try to rob you; or woodcutters are felling trees, or a criminal is complaining on the back of a horse tied up"
Florence,I played both RDR2 on s a great experience but a little slower pace. Cyberpunk was broke and I fell off before I completed it
Florence,"Both are on sale pretty often but I would do RDR2 first without question. There are certain games you absolutely have to at least play. Don’t have to finish it if it don’t click but it’s an absolute must play. Cyberpunk is a great story with not the best gameplay, plus very raunchy. It’s gotten much better over the years however."
Florence,Red dead 2 is leagues better imo
Florence,Rdr2 is probably the best story in a game I have ever played. Full stop. It is genuinely one of the most amazing game stories there is. I would recommend it over cyberpunk based on that alone
Florence,Red Dead 1st by far
Florence,"Imo they are both very enjoyable from a story and gameplay angle. Some of it comes to taste (do you want a Wild West game or futuristic urban environment?). In my opinion you can’t go wrong but there is a reason Red Dead 2 is considered one of the greatest single player games of all time. 


Also, if this matters, cyberpunk is a 30-50 hour game if you complete the story and do a lot of side quests. Red dead 2 is more of a 50+ hour kind of game."
Florence,RDR2
Florence,I would say red dead now and cyberpunk later
Florence,"Cause I don't play video games no more
Never play video games
But Red Dead Redemption 2, that is not a game
It's an incredible journey through old American history
Fighting for your life and fighting for your family
Try to live your days with honor and integrity
That's not a game, that's an adult thing
That's not a game at all
That's like fuckin' Shakespeare
- Jack Black"
Florence,"Objectively RDR2 is the better game in almost every way, and it’s also cheaper right now. But man I can’t help but absolutely adore cyberpunk, even more than red dead. My brain says get red dead but my heart says get cyberpunk"
Florence,"Cyberpunk is pretty cool, but RDR2 is a goddamn masterpiece."
Florence,"If you like first person action RPG and sci -fi allot like I do Cyberpunk carried the magic. After the millionth plot twist I gave up on Rdr2, cyberpunk is short sweet and tragic."
Florence,I would say get red dead. It honestly looks like the better game out of the two and you can always get a refund if you really don't like it.
Florence,"Red dead 2, 100%"
Florence,Could not put RDR2 down finished in under a month. Cyberpunk took me at least 4.
Florence,99.9% of time my answer to this sub is just r/piratedgames
Florence,rdr2 all the way
Florence,Red Dead Redemption 2 !
Florence,Rdr 2
Florence,Both are amazing and should be played but get rdr2 first and wait till the new dlc to get cyberpunk.
Florence,"RDR2 is to date the best single game I’ve ever played by far.

It’s a masterpiece."
Florence,RDR2. Without a doubt.
Florence,RDR2
Florence,Do you want rootin tootin cowboy shootin or stressy messy cyborg depressy?
Florence,"I love both, but cyberpunk is good and RDR2 is next level amazing."
Florence,"In between missions, RDR2 is quite therapeutic to play."
Florence,"Late to the party, but would like to share my thoughts:

CP2077 has some fantastic writing and beautiful graphics. That being said, it’s a very shallow game in every other department. Given the world-building, it has amazing potential. If they had just given the game another couple years to incubate, it easily could’ve been one of the greatest action-adventure RPGs of its time. 

RDR2 is, on the other hand, *also* a game that has fantastic writing and beautiful graphics. It is, however, the type of game that *did* get the time it needed to fully flesh out all the other aspects of its gameplay. The result is a highly immersive experience with a lot of replayability and content that can last you hundreds of hours."
Florence,"It's not even really a fair comparison. 

RDR2 is a ridiculous rich and developed world with unbelievable detail (sometimes to much) and a story that is extremely engaging. It also has some of the best NPC reactions/interactions and is probably one of the top 3 hunting games in the last decade all rolled into one.

Cyberpunk is a mostly dead world with poor interactivity with npcs, a convoluted story that barely makes sense, and is almost entirely empty. I know I mentioned dead and empty twice but it needed repeating. The game had so much potential it didn't live up to its ridiculous. The games AI is almost as bad as basic vanilla skyrim back in the day. Luckily most of the bugs seem to have been dealt with but the game is still not worth buying in my opinion"
Florence,I've played both. They're both pretty good. Rdr2 is the best of the 2.
Florence,def red dead!
Florence,I have never met someone who didnt like rdr2 but cyberpunk seems to be hit or miss i have friends who love it but i have had no enjoyment playing it at all
Florence,"Cyberpunk is one of my all-time favourites, but Red Dead II is objectively the GOAT"
Florence,RDR 2 and don't think twice. Cyberpunk is good but RDR2 is a masterpiece and goated.
Florence,"I haven't played Cyberpunk yet, but RDR2 is a must play. I held off on playing RDR2 for a long time, due to people saying its slow paced. That was a mistake. I didn't feel slow to me, because the story is so good. If it was a movie, it would get an Oscar."
Florence,Rdr2 first and then cyberpunk
Florence,RDR2 no contest
Florence,RDR2 is at minimum a top 10 all time must play game
Florence,Red dead is wayyyy better than cyber.
Florence,"10/10 ""wild west"" (kind of) open world with a 10/10 story or a, well, cyberpunk open world with a 9,5/10 story


your call"
Florence,"Rdr2 is amazing. Cyberpunk is great and one of the better open world games I've played ever. I've played a lot of games and I adore this game. Wasn't perfect obviously with the console bugs but it's still great. If you're on pc then get it,next gen consoles then yeah. Previous gen then definitely no. 

After playing both, I can say both are great and damn good games. RDR2 is a masterpiece and Cyberpunk could one day end up being remembered as one. If not for the bugs and launch issues then kt would've been perfect imo"

Florence,"Cyberpunk is one of the more fun games I've played in years.  Red dead redemption 2 is the single greatest game I've ever played. Play both, but start with red dead."
Florence,How much is rdr2? I just bought it for $70? 😭😭😭😭
Florence,Anyone who is a gamer must play RDR2
Florence,Cyberpunk. That's just me though. This is really a question you need to ask yourself.
Florence,"Well I would say both, but I would suggest leaving cyberpunk aside until Phantom Liberty comes out and you can experience it at its highest. So for now, I recommend Red Dead. It's very fun, finished it recently, couldn't put my controller down, one week of my holiday gone, spent 110 hours on the game. Just don't overwhelm yourself and don't rush too much with the story, just enjoy the game's atmosphere and its randomness and progress in the story in whatever way feels best to you.

If you worry about completionism, I recommend making a manual save for everytime you start a new chapter."
Florence,Cyberpunk has finally gotten out of the shadow of its launch and is finally the game it was promised to be. But RDR 2 would be Rockstar’s masterpiece if the first game and GTA V didn’t already exist. Definitely check both games out but give Red Dead Redemption 2 a try first.
Florence,I liked Cyberpunk a lot but RDR2 is the way to go
Florence,Cyberpunk only because it going to get a overhaul that makes the game worth playing but red dead 2 is hella fun as well so wouldn't blame you if you got that over it since cyberpunk started off bad and kept people off it.
Florence,RDR2. It has an amazing story.
Florence,I haven't played Cyberpunk but RDR2 is such a masterpiece so that's my vote :)
Florence,Red Dead Redemption is a masterpiece. Cyberpunk in its current state is fine but nowhere near RDR2 level.
Florence,RDR2
Florence,"I played both, and 110% would pick RDR2 over cyberpunk. I think I’ve replayed it 4 times now. Played through Cyberpunk once and haven’t felt much like going back. Just a richer story in RDR2."
Florence,"i know everyone and their mom has already said it in this comment section, but i’m gonna add my voice to the choir anyways: rdr2 first, without a doubt."
Florence,RDR2 is great. would never spend money on cyberjunk
Florence,Rdr2 is slow as fuck cyberpunk is fast paced so i would go for cyberpunk (haven't been a fan of slow paced walking and riding Sims no matter how good the story is if they can't give it to me in a faster manner or keep me retained i ain't bout that)
Florence,RDR 2
Florence,"Wow, someone needs to rep cyberpunk here.  I loved it.  Best game of last 5 years for me.

Rdr2 was boring for me.  Scenery was pretty and all but I just found it repetitive.  Ride horse, shoot, do boring camp stuff, etc.  I dunno I like doing that stuff in real life.  

Cyberpunk is just super fun.  The soundtrack bangs.. you get swords implanted in your arms... the lore is super interesting.. lots of meaningful choices.  It's the only game I've ever replayed 

CP got a bad rap at launch.  I get it.  But on PS5 today it rocks"
Florence,"Cyberpunk will have a GOTY edition either with Phantom Liberty’s release or shortly thereafter. Acquiring RDR2 right now makes more sense, at least to me."
Florence,Buy rdr2 and when cyberpunk gets a complete edition buy that one later on
Florence,Both are incredible. I would not recommend getting Cyberpunk on a PS4 as it just stops working for me after like an hour of play time. RDR2 is a considerably better game but both are worth it
Florence,"Play RDR, then go to the second one - you won't regret it."
Florence,"I'm playing Cyberpunk rn and while id say it is a very good game and looks incredible, it is still nowhere near as polished as RDR2, combat, movement, interactions, npcs, customization and most of the things that make an open world/exploration game good are better in RDR2 in my opinion. But id still recommend you to get Cyberpunk later, it is a great game."
Florence,"Red dead 2, Cyberpunk isn't bad now, but RDR2 still has a good case for being the best game of all time."
Florence,I would get RDR2 first. Its long game with a much better story imo. Plus cyberpunk is getting that expansion in a few months that'll be overhauling some gameplay mechanics.
Florence,Cyberpunk.
Florence,"Red dead’s storymode is god tier, online can be amazing, Cyberpunk is very good, Perosnally I’d say red dead if you’ll play the online, cyberpunk if ur not gonna play the online"
Florence,"I say it depends on your system. I have a PS4 slim and cyberpunk is unplayable after the last large update. Gonna have to get a ps5 to actually play it. Could be my save corrupted somehow, but the game freezes after 20 minutes almost religiously."
Florence,RDR2 is one the best video games ever made. Definitely go for that first.
Florence,RDR2 any day of the week.
Florence,"Play RDR2 first and then buy Cyberpunk when the new expansion drops. I love both games, but it sounds like CP2077: Phantom Liberty will be the definitive edition"
Florence,"I would recommend both, but you need to play RDR2 if you haven't first"
Florence,Red dead redemption 2 a million times over cyberpunk
Florence,"RDR2, absolutely."
Florence,"I think cyberpunk and the expansion are on sale right now. But I’d go for rdr2 first considering it will be more instant gratification then having to wait till December for the expansion on cyberpunk, which will have a ton of new content meant to make the experience way better."
Florence,"Cyberpunk is poorly written, rdr2 is a masterclass"
Florence,RDR2 by a mile
Florence,"I played both games this year. I haven't finished Cyberpunk yet but it's pretty fun, I love everything about it except for some game breaking bugs and funny braindead AI. Both games are great but RDR2 is a triump; storytelling, characters, sound design, voice acting and impressive life-like world with a lot of details and hidden gems in it although gameplay is your standard Rockstar game, it's still an immersive game."
Florence,"I would recommend that you never buy cyberpunk and if Red dead is your thing, go for it. (It’s not my thing. But seriously, don’t buy cyberpunk.)"
Florence,Definitely Red Dead Redemption 2. Best game i have ever played since 2006
Florence,"huge cyberpunk fan here, i'd probably buy it when phantom liberty comes out since they're overhauling everything. RDR2 however was a masterpiece when it came out. definitely grab it, especially if on sale"
Florence,RDR2 will make you question if any game you ever played was good at all.
Florence,"Fair warning. I also say RDR2, BUT you need to go into it realizing it IS intentionally slower paced. Take your time with it, really invest in the characters and just hang out in the world, exploring and such. However, that said, I absolutely LOVE RDR2. It’s my favorite of all time."
Florence,Rdr2
Florence,"Both are really good 

I really enjoyed RDR2 a lot but Cyberpunk has something that really made me love it. 

I don't know if it's the setting or the overall dystopian world but it's a really great experience now

Plus Phantom Liberty is coming in september I believe so it might be worth a try"
Florence,"Both are on par and considered masterpieces of their own, CP story is more complex and fast paced while RDR2 is more of a slow burn kind of story. I think that CP is the superior game but I think you should buy both."
Florence,"Imo RDR2 is superior in essentially every aspect, I would definitely try it out."
Florence,Get both
Florence,"Definitely RDR2, seriously it contains the best protagonist you’ll ever play."
Florence,"Red dead is a must - cyberpunk is a should, so play RDR 2 first, then when the DLC is out pick up cyberpunk"
Florence,RDR2. I played both but for me RDR2 is just better.
Florence,"RDR2 barring it’s online is easily one of the best games ever made in my opinion. Same goes for RDR1, which can be played in either order. On top of that there’s undead nightmare as an added plus"
Florence,"I love both. But if I had to choose, it would be RDR2"
Florence,"Honestly both are really great games, you should pick based on what type of world you would like to dive into. Dystopian future, vs movie western."
Florence,Rdr2 killed my parents. We’re happily married now.
Florence,"RDR2 for sure!!!! I'm playing it again right now. Easily in my top 10 greatest games of all time. And with the amount of games I've played over 30+ years, that is really saying something."
Florence,Honestly they are both amazing In their own rights. RDR2 is considered one of the best games of all time tho so it’s an easy pick
Florence,"Obvious answer is rdr 2 first, but let me say this. No open world game will ever be the same after rdr2. Its miles ahead any game ive played to this day, technically and story wise."
Florence,"Both games are amazing. You can't go wrong with either - great storyline, great side quests, you can just dig yourself in for hours and hours. I'd highly recommend both. But if I had to pick one, I'd say RDR2. It left a bigger impression on me after finishing it."
Florence,"RDR2 is probably the better game from a technical standpoint, but I found the controls kind of kludgy to be honest.  I beat it once and have never felt the desire to replay it.

Cyberpunk on the other hand is the kind of game I can beat then immediately want to start a new character.  Yeah, it's undoubtably not as polished, but I just had more fun with it.  (Again, a big part of this probably just comes back to the controls, which were a lot smoother in Cyberpunk.)

Honestly...  You should just  get them BOTH!"
Florence,Rdr2 is easily the greatest console game ever made
Florence,"They’re very different games which is something to bare in mind. However, RDR2 is a much more polished product. I’d play that first and then pick up 2077/Phantom Liberty because they have basically said that the entire game is getting overhauled and polished with the next update/DLC in September. Both games will grip you emotionally as they’re very well written"
Florence,I played through cyberpunk twice. I stopped playing RDR2 when I got bored of riding my horsey.
Florence,Cyberpunk. Honestly RDR2 kind of bored me
Florence,And I will play it. Thanks for the reply.
Florence,Yeah what else is there to say? Although Cyberpunk is very enjoyable
Florence,I would say portal is a triumph.
Florence,"Sure, I guess then RDR2 it is. Thanks for the reply."
Florence,I won't pass on either but I guess first I will go through RDR2. Thanks for the reply.
Florence,I didn't feel the same. What is so unmissable about red dead for you?
Florence,To be honest it really depends. Personally I felt Red dead was a little to realistic for me and Cyber punk was more actiony.
Florence,">It will give you a thrill, make you feel like a badass, and then leave you in tears.

beautifully said."
Florence,Yes.
Florence,Same here it's hard to get into other games since I've played rdr2 I keep going back to it.
Florence,"Yeah, I guess waiting for the new update and dlc is the best option as new things will be added along with overhauls. Thanks for the reply."
Florence,What kind of depth does rdr2 have?
Florence,"Yeah. I just saw the dlc as pre-order along with Cyberpunk, but I think it will not be a great idea to buy it as they are adding and overhauling some features of the game in the next update probably. I guess waiting atleast till the update will be the right choice. Thanks for the reply."
Florence,I’ve just started the game is it best to wait for the DLC then and when does it drop ?
Florence,Phantom Pain is Metal Gear Solid. Cyberpunk 2077's expansion is called Phantom Liberty.
Florence,Do you know if ultimate version of RDR2 is worth it?
Florence,Any other game similar to rdr2 in gameplay? I love the sort of chill vibes with the option of action.
Florence,Careful it's CP2077
Florence,"Just a minor note that the outfit issue was fixed with a transmog function, so now you can play dress up and not just worry about stats.  But if you want to see your own outfit you have to drive a motorcycle."
Florence,Should I finish cyberpunk before the dlc?
Florence,"Yeah same here, RDR2 was amazing but I was way more immersed in Cyberpunk's world than RDR2's one 

Though both are really great games and should be played imo"
Florence,"Sorry to bother, but I would also like to ask which edition of RDR2 should I get. I will tell beforehand that I don't think I will be playing online version of the game."
Florence,I think most people agree that RDR2’s story is great and the strongest part of the game besides the visuals.
Florence,"Bruh. Who has the audacity to say RDR2 doesn’t have a good story?

It’s been widely, widely lauded as having one of the best stories in recent years"
Florence,"Thanks. I think story is subjective so might really like RDR2 too as I am not a huge fan of futuristic world. Though I am not a huge fan of Cowboys either (mediaeval fan here), though I might like it if I play it. Thanks for replying, I might get RDR2 now and wait for the update and expansion of Cyberpunk."
Florence,"I don't know about the story, but the best video game character is BT-7274. Period."
Florence,"This is how I feel. Cyberpunk was faster paced and I got more immediate gratification. I actually still haven’t gotten very far in RDR2 just because it has been slower-paced, but that being said, it is an exceptionally well-designed game"
Florence,"You’ve just described my exact experience. I really enjoyed RDR2 but we had just had our first baby when the it released - I just didn’t have the time and it fell by the wayside as a result, so I never finished it. Cyberpunk I managed to complete several times over on PS4 Pro and one more on PS5. Every single play through I’ve played completely differently to the last. It’s been immense. The sheer variety on offer with the story and the play styles means totally different experiences each time. While Red Dead is a beautiful and epic experience - it’s a fairly unilateral one. The only real variety coming from how many side missions or how much peripheral content you want to pursue. My wife played Cyberpunk more than I did - her sessions were vastly different to mine. I haven’t seen anything quite like it since the likes of Elder Scrolls."
Florence,“HANK! DON’T ABBREVIATE CYBERPUNK LIKE THAT! HAAAAANK!”
Florence,Not really. Where is the single player content?
Florence,"Same is experience. RDR2 more polished and you interact with more things, and NPC has better reactions. But cyberpunk is just more fun to play.

My biggest issue with rockstar games is that on rails and very linear. That’s being said they still quality games and will buying the next Rockstar game when it comes out."
Florence,You can always turn off aim assist for a better challenge in RDR2
Florence,What do you mean by terrible gameplay in RDR2?
Florence,"Yeah, just saw the amount of things they are adding in the update and expansion. Some of it is overhaul of current systems so I guess waiting for the update and the dlc is the best thing for now. Anyways, I would like to ask one more thing, should I buy RDR2 on Epic store or Steam because as far as I have heard, Epic store has a really bad mod support for games. And I guess there some fine mods for RDR2 so would like to get my hands on them. Thanks."
Florence,"> game i *paid* for. So

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*"
Florence,"I played the game about a year ago and only experienced like 5 bugs, none of them even being close to game breaking"
Florence,I bought and played a month or so ago and experienced almost 0 bugs. I think one quest messed up and that was it. After the most recent patch it seems pretty good. Also looks amazing with the ray tracing.
Florence,">the janky controls are super frustrating and honestly it’s pretty slow at times. I don’t need to watch long animations every time I pick something up or do anything. It’s more cowboy sim than game.  
>  
>Tried it 3 times and never make it past 10 hrs or so.

Not every game is made for you."
Florence,you think cyberpunk is a fail because of first week youtube videos and headlines. mostly everyone that plays the game says it is on track to becoming a no man's sky type revive
Florence,Cyberpunk absolutely does not have better writing…
Florence,no reason to skip one of the greatest games of this generation
Florence,"How is it overrated, there’s no game that has that level of detail, i can understand not enjoying the slow paced gameplay, but you can’t deny that no game has pushed the boundaries of open world like red dead in terms of immersion."
Florence,sure buddy go play ludo
Florence,You're getting hate but it's true. RD2 felt more like an interactive movie than a game.
Florence,"For reference, I have played both and love both, I even lean towards rdr2, but I am recommending based on OP's interests, unlike most of you"

Florence,I’ll be honest I thought RDR2 was a tedious piece of trash and nothing like the first game. Cyberpunk   Is more fun and you’ll want to play it more.
Florence,"Cyberpunk is getting a big expansion in September, along with a huge update that overhauls the whole game pretty much. Definitely hit RDR first and then grab cyberpunk after the update sometime."
Florence,Great story.  Great gameplay.  Great experience overall.
Florence,"I think it has some serious flaws but most of those flaws are in line with the vision of the game rather than being oversights. Like all the animations and forced walk sections, or the controls not being very arcadey with no jump button. The main flaw that defies this rule is the absurdly on-the-rails quests, which are typical for Rockstar.

All of that being said, it was in many ways a masterwork. Unparalleled attention to detail. Felt great to explore and discover. Could sink absurd hours into it or just pick up and play, and either way is fun. I find myself coming back to it all the time and finding things I missed.

It was imo the first Open World to feature both breadth and depth in world design without being riddled with bugs. You can tell the crunch went into perfecting the details rather than throwing the game together.

Gameplay and story not revolutionary but consistently solid."
Florence,It’s an absolute masterpiece.
Florence,"I've played and beaten both, and I love both games. That being said RDR2 is a fucking masterpiece. I don't know any game I'd pick over rdr2 in a one on one."
Florence,"It's probably the deepest and most fully realized open world ever crafted, filled with rich and compelling characters, emergent choices, and awesome things to discover. It's held up by many experts as one of the iconic examples of video games as art. But go off, chief. Contrarianism is all the rage."
Florence,"It would be easier to list what components of RDR2 *do not* have depth:

Enemies - it's all pew pew guys across the board.

Mounts - it's all horses across the board.

As for narrative, gameplay, world building, world interaction, customization, side missions, character developments, npc interactions, etc. etc. etc., I could go on but I've given your clearly catty, insincere comment enough effort and time, maybe just become more interesting in the future and open up with a compelling point next time."
Florence,September 26.
Florence,Haha very true that was a Freudian slip!
Florence,"If you can get it cheap then maybe but I don't think it's worth it, personally."
Florence,Rdr1 is the only one I can think of
Florence,GTA
Florence,Death Stranding I suppose both tedious games but are top 3 for me
Florence,Oh that’s good to know. And thanks for the correction
Florence,No they plan to overhaul the ai and make other changes. (Better Skill tree for example)
Florence,"In which case, the cheapest version. The ultimate edition just has online content iirc"
Florence,"Is the story really good or are the characters just carrying everything? Playing rn and the story is kind of meh. Rockstar games never really had a great main story, but that is not necessary with all the fun.

Not saying I'm right, just how I am feeling right now."
Florence,[deleted]
Florence,"Many actually. And even as a huge fan myself, I understand that the pacing of that story is all over the place and many of my friends drop it after initial 2-3 snowy hours and I keep on trying to convince them."
Florence,"When I was contemplating rdr2 I felt like you. I also was unsure about the horse riding mechanic, as I was used to GTA and using vehicles. And I was unsure I would enjoy the 1899 setting. But let me tell you, get this game! It’s so good. You will end up being fascinated with the world, including the horse riding."
Florence,"I've tried to get into RDR2 multiple times, I really appreciate the quality and complexity of the game, but I just can't, because I find the entire cowboy setting to be boring and uninteresting."
Florence,"The game was so good and complete at release, it didn’t need it."
Florence,"There's a reason why they made auto aim the default in RDR2, because the combat is so clunky that it needs it"
Florence,It’s a very boring gameplay that’s for sure.
Florence,Mainly because the mission design and combat are so bad
Florence,"I play on PS5, so I wouldn't know much about epic store vs steam. Maybe try asking on the Red Dead sub, they will probably give better answers than I could"
Florence,You can mod pretty much everygame on steam just as well if not better than epic. Some games even have steam cumunity mods through the steam store such as l4d2. Really the only reason id choose epic over steam for anything is if epic is giving a game away for free and even them there are some cases where id still just rather buy it from steam.
Florence,Good bot
Florence,The freind i borrowed it from said the same thing so i guess it varied from person to person. My experience was a mess. Nothing game breaking in the sense that i couldn't progress but a lot of religing becouse i got stuck in terminals and uis. Also had this one where jackie always had his gun out no matter what animtion he was doing or where he was. Even had it on that mission where we coukdnt bring our guns. Nothing could have been done to fix that one just had to accept that that was jakie now for that playthrough
Florence,"Im with this guy, never had any game breaking bugs in this game from day 1. Playing PC with a good gpu over on my end tho. If youve got a 30 series gpu or newer cyberpunk runs literally fine"
Florence,Yeah thats one thing i can personally attest to it looks really good. Also it supports dlss 3 fram generation so it runs really smooth a 4000 series card.
Florence,"This is a stupid fucking reply

Nowhere did they say that. They're allowed to criticise the controls of a game when someone asks for opinions on that game. Opinions from both sides are important when deciding whether to buy something or not."
Florence,Never said it was.
Florence,It's widely agreed the controls and combat are super clunky.
Florence,"Opinions are opinions my dude, both games had amazing writing but I felt more connected to Cyberpunk."
Florence,Guess the opinions are divided. I didn't like rdr2's writing very much. What was so great about it then?
Florence,I agree about the level of detail. For sure it's impressive in that aspect. It's just soooo fucking slooow man. I almost didn't finish that game considering how tedious it was. I'm sorry.
Florence,Ok
Florence,"Tedious as f... imo. I almost didn't finish it, but the story got me through. Gameplay was the worst!"
Florence,"Weird, I was raised by fast paced shooters and such and absolutely adored rdr2 despite its slower nature."
Florence,"Want to cook some food? 10 minute animation per piece cooked. Want to loot something? 10 minute animation of you picking the body up. Want to skin an animal? 45 minute animation. Oh, and btw, you need hundreds of pelts if you want to do side content. It is the most ridiculous shit.

Everyone kept telling me I needed to get to chapter 2 to really get a feel for the game. I made it past chapter 2 and I still hate the game. Only now I'm past my refund window and hate it even more now.

Every mission is you riding with some member of your crew on horseback for 45 minutes while you get gigantic exposition dumps. RDR2 is the game you get when you distill the WORST parts of the GTA franchise down into a cowboy game.

This was the first game that was universally praised, in a genre I love, that I hated to it's core. It has me questioning whether or not i should even bother buying the last of us on PC."
Florence,Where are details on the huge update? Can’t seem to find any but very interested
Florence,Still playing cyberpunk on a console like ps5 is like playing in a ghost town. If OP has a decent rig he should definitely hit cyberpunk in September.
Florence,"Wasn't this supposed to come out this month? I am very excited about the DLC, but I'll believe the release date once I've downloaded it."
Florence,"Will they completely drop their sad excuse for an armor system, their sad excuse for a weapon system, and their sad excuse for a perk system? Oh wait… that’s like every system in the damn game. Would be silly to ask for that.

Edit: holy shit it looks like they are!"
Florence,"I thought it was very visually impressive and well acted. Also the soundtrack fucking slaps. I love the soundtrack. It also usually managed to capture the intended vibe very well. But it wasn't very thought-provoking. And some of the side content just completely misses the mark. 

Cyberpunk is a lot less polished and pleasant. But some of the sidequests could have carried entire high-quality indiegames."
Florence,"Trailing missions, long ass point a to point b travel, goofy ah shooting, extremely linear missions, breaking the games economy with that stage coach robbery mission. Can’t deny the flaws."
Florence,Did not know a simple question was a clearly catty insincere comment....
Florence,"Lol what a pathetically insecure reply. RDR2 has absolutely zero depth when it comes to gameplay, mission structure, level design, or npc interactions. It’s all shallow set dressing for a pretty decent story that would’ve worked better as a TV series. As an actual videogame, it’s average at best."
Florence,"> I've given your clearly catty, insincere comment enough effort and time, maybe just become more interesting in the future and open up with a compelling point next time.

You’re right - how dare he ask a simple question about your favourite game?! The audacity of /u/ihave0idea0 knows no limits! 

Personally I find RDR2 wholly unappealing to me, mostly because what I’ve seen of the combat mechanics seems quite repetitive and more importantly not skill-based.  
But I also don’t like the Elder Scrolls series or Cyberpunk for the same reason, so this thread just isn’t for me."
Florence,"Yeah, been through that. And online doesn't do it for me"
Florence,I actually have that. Might give it a try
Florence,Oh I’ll wait then damn okay thanks.
Florence,Thank you very much.
Florence,"It’s definitely more character driven than plot driven. It might take a while for the story to get going, but when it does, it’s really some of the best dramatic writing I’ve ever seen in anything. It’s worth sticking with for sure."
Florence,"… that’s what a story is, a journey of characters through an arc. The plot of 99% of stories is the same basic shit."
Florence,"Fair, I can’t seem to get into Witcher 3, despite being a huge fan of the lore and gameplay.

It just… feels so huge and cumbersome"
Florence,Yeah the story feels very disjointed. You do like 5 completely unrelated main story missions and then eventually come across another mission that advances the story. How’s that a great story? I get that people like those unrelated main missions since they like long games and are willing to tolerate a somewhat disjointed story if it means a longer game. But you can’t tell me that’s a good story. A good story must have a good flow.
Florence,Rdr2 is easily top 5 of last gen
Florence,"Yeah it's not even gameplay.
Just high quality movie"
Florence,Tried that but didn't get any answer. Other modding subreddits had no idea either. I guess I will try asking there again. Thank you very much.
Florence,"Actually had a coupon on epic store, so wouldn't want it to go to waste. I have some other the list but would live to know if epic store version can be modded. The RDR2 subreddit seems kinda dead with most of the posts with no replies so I think I might not get one there either."
Florence,Best bot
Florence,">This is a stupid fucking reply

Exactly my thoughts lol.

I absolutely loved RDR2 but I can totally see how it can be boring for some people. In fact, I've seen plenty of comments on various subs saying exactly that, so I think it's important thing to highlight for OP."
Florence,"It was cool at first but then I just got tired of it quick. I also work 50hrs a week with like 1 hour commute one way so I just don’t have time for slow games anymore. 
That being said getting off a horse just to pick something up every time is just an awful game play design."
Florence,What a debby downer you are. Pessimistic much? Lol
Florence,Valid
Florence,"[Check it](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/147domj/everything_new_with_phantom_liberty_and_patch_17/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)

I’m pretty excited"
Florence,It says September 26th on steam. Even if you don't get the DLC you still get access to the massive overhaul btw.
Florence,I think the side content is amazing. Maybe some things could be better but it is very good
Florence,"Yeah I get that but thought provoking is not what I expect from Rockstar, or any game outside of select RPGs.

It’s more like a great execution of a tried and true formula. If I wanted a thought provoking Western, I’d reread Blood Meridian, not play an open world game."
Florence,There’s nothing thought provoking about Cyperpunk either
Florence,They’re not flaws…  They’re features!
Florence,Yeah rockstar hasn't improved it's gameplay since GTA San Andreas. It's a shame because visually and story wise the games are brilliant
Florence,"It's not a simple question, it's probably the most highly praised game of the last decade, pretending that you know nothing about it whatsoever and have decided to randomly come to me to learn more about it is naive and stupid at best."
Florence,"And this is the kind of dumbass mentality that went behind asking 'hurr, what kind of depth rdr2 got?'"
Florence,"The OP asked which game should he play, not your emotional personal take that doesn’t help at all and literally NO ONE cares about"
Florence,I hear you. Just the most similar gameplay I could think of. Basically the same game at a different time period with different technology.
Florence,"Story wise, propably. Gameplay, definetly not."
Florence,I dont see why not you wouldnt be able too. Modding alters your local files on your system so i feel like whichever store front you bought it from wouldnt matter. All the games ive ever modded were on steam but i never had to actually interact with steam to do it so i feel like the same processes would have worked even if i bought them from epic.
Florence,"Fair enough, that horse thing is true"
Florence,"Everyone I know loves this game. So I never criticize it around them, because I would feel like a debbie downer. It was just exciting to finally see someone else hate it."
Florence,Everything he said is valid and he’s entitled to his opinion. That isn’t pessimism
Florence,"The shredder of panda guy I’m replying to blocked  me, then reported me to Reddit for some kinda wellness check?? People are so weird.. wtf"
Florence,"Thank you. 

Man I am hype now."
Florence,I'm happy for you. That I didn't feel the same doesn't mean I want to take that away from you
Florence,"I don't think thought provoking was something they were not trying to do. The story of the main characters in what is essentially a cult was compelling but just not for that long. 

Also looking at cyberpunk again. I think there are plenty of moments there that could be labeled thought provoking. 

Maybe I just wanted the wrong things from the game."
Florence,"No? What about Joshua's quest line? Rivers quest line? The quests with the mayor and his wife? V's story, the different endings. Even the quest with the vending machine ends up asking some interesting questions."
Florence,Let’s hope for gta 6 I personally didn’t like rdr2 as much as other people did for personal reasons but I still thought it was a fantastic game
Florence,"Damn, you even double-downed on it.

People ARE allowed to not know everything about RDR2, man.

You clearly spend a lot of time thinking about your favourite video games - that’s fine, but you should realise that other people may have other interests and may actually not know much about it, if at all.

As I said I personally find the gameplay uninteresting (not sure how you can think it has a lot of depth, tbh) - and a game without good gameplay is just a bad game to me. Therefore I have little interest in Rockstar games in general, because their gameplay is usually super casual-oriented.

As for the rest of you description of the depth of the game, you used a bunch of buzz-words but didn’t actually explaining anything to the guy.

Good graphics, good story, world building, character development and voice acting are great, but if that’s all there is to it, I’d rather watch a movie or read a book tbh. Gameplay is where games are at for me, and a lot of people in general."
Florence,"Did you mean to reply to someone else?

How am I the emotional one for replying to someone having a complete meltdown at the mère idea that someone didn’t know the alleged qualities of RDR2?

I explained why I thought that neither games thought of by OP were particularly good in my opinion. That’s very relevant to the discussion.

What’s the point of your needlessly aggressive comment that no one asked for and no one cares about, to use your own words?"
Florence,Exactly. However I think my emotional investment was larger in rdr2. But time period doesn't really matter.
Florence,"Thanks for the reply. Just wanted to make sure. Actually, I heard and experienced issues with modding, especially with Bethesda games in Epic Games Store. And in general have heard people saying that Epic store is pretty bad if someone wants to play with mods. Modding for me is one of the main and most fun things (especially in games like Skyrim) so sometimes no excess to mods can be a huge deal breaker for me."
Florence,"""10 minute animation. 45 minute animation"". Yeah sure  that's real valid isn't it lol. Someone being overly negative and blowing something out of proportion is considered to be pessimistic to me. I never said he was wrong and couldn't have an opinion. I just called him a debby downer. I'm entitled to my opinion as well right?"
Florence,"Hey, what didn’t you like about the side content? I guess hunting is kinda barebones"
Florence,"Rivers quest was so boring. Go here, fetch this. Fetch that. Search the nephews room for clues. Snooze fest. It was nothing I haven’t seen before a million times. Most of the side quests were boring as hell. There were some cool moments, but thought provoking? Nah."
Florence,"Don't care, didn't read; get more interesting and stop leaning on sarcasm as a crutch for your lack of personality."
Florence,Continue with your non contributions. Op asked which game and here you are just wasting thread space
Florence,If you want to rant about how terrible RDR2 is make your own post
Florence,"Your making comments on someone’s character over a game, if anything you’re a Debby downer"
Florence,"Some of the sidequests were kinda stupid and unsatisfying. The one that stuck in my mind the most was the one where you encounter that woman who takes advantage of two guys with disabilities and the ark of the story is that the guys don't want to be with her because she's an absolutely horrible, abusive human being. Then when you find them they realise that they're still gonna go with her. 

Like what's the point? I had no input, the ark of the characters was to learn to put up with an abuser and it took like 20 minutes. 

&#x200B;

Not to say that I encountered no good sidequests. The one where you help a woman learn to live in the forest was lovely. But the game to me was littered with moments that ended in an unsatisfying anticlimax."
Florence,"Very interesting. What did you think of >!
Jackies funeral? !<"
Florence,"That comes from the guy that screeched and had a complete meltdown when someone else dared ask which kind of depth RDR2 had, because how dare he not know your favourite video game.

There is 0 irony in my last comment, btw! Not that I would expect you to understand irony…

Lmfao, reddit basement-dweller moment."
Florence,"What’s YOUR contribution, lad? What’s your purpose? Why are you commenting?

As I said above, I explained why I thought neither of the games were particularly good in my opinion. That’s highly relèvent on a sub where people ask whether they should buy specific games.

My comment is on topic. Yours aren’t and are just useless attacks with 0 contribution on the actual subject. Are you perhaps an alt of the other guy? That’s the o my way this would make sense, tbh. You’re weird"
Florence,"Ranting? For a whole 2 lines? Do you even know what a rant is? Open a dictionary ffs

The guy above had a meltdown when someone asked a simple question, I pointed out to him that no everyone necessarily liked every game or knew everything about every game.

That’s highly relevant to the conversation.

Once again, what is YOUR contribution here, apart from attacking me for no reason?"
Florence,You're making comments about my character over a reddit post. A bit hypocritical.
Florence,"Well, I didn't realize they had disabilities. Maybe I'm just stupid. I'm guessing your talking about the one where you had to keep punching and kicking those guys to prove which one was stronger? 

I saw it as funny, and I never saw them go back to her, I don't think I ever saw them after their final mission.  


Maybe I just didn't find them or I'm stupid. Oh well, I enjoyed those missions, and yeah that one with charlotte (woman in forest) was great."
Florence,Getting his bike was the best part
Florence,"No, you were in fact, weird because no one cares what you don’t like. I was genuinely interested in seeing how much people loved one game over the other but here you are."
Florence,I already gave my contribution
Florence,"My contribution was that I love both games but I feel like RDR two gets the one here because not only is it one of the greatest games of all time, but the story is pretty impactful"
Florence,My context might seem illiterate because I am using voice to text
Florence,"I think we're talking about another quest.  I googled it, it's called ""the smell of grease paint""."
Florence,"Intruiging. I absolutely love that quest for how real it feels. 
>! How it takes the time to mourn and speak to the people that this affected. Presenting a death so realistically gave so much validity to the rest of the world. It made me remember times I've lost people. 
Death in video games is never presented like this. !<"
Florence,"That sounds like a you issue, tbh

- Some people love one game more than the other

- some people prefer the other one

- some people like neither of them

These are all valid opinions on the exact same subject. I’m in the third camp, for reasons that I explained. I would therefore recommend OP to buy neither of these games if the reasons I gave resonate with him.

It’s hilarious that you don’t see that my comment is very much on topic for this thread - logic isn’t your forte, huh"
Florence,"Clearly not in this chain of comment, which is why I’m asking you what you’re even doing here."
Florence,"Fair enough! That’s understandable.

My contribution was that I didn’t like either of them for the reason stated above (gameplay isn’t interesting or skill-based enough, and that’s what matters most in games in my opinion), and therefore wouldn’t recommend either of them.

Don’t you see how my opinion is just as valid as yours? Again, why are you commenting here?"
Into the Breach,"I would recommend The Last of Us part 2. It’s made better, has less bugs, a better story, and is very visually impressive."
Into the Breach,TLOU2
Into the Breach,If you want a Fnaf game I’d say go with Sister Location
Into the Breach,TLOU P2 is the easy winner here
Into the Breach,Yeah I bought tlou 2 a couple of hours ago and I’m loving it
Into the Breach,Congrats! It’s a hell of a rollercoaster
Enter the Gungeon,"It depends on what type of game you prefer to play. EtG is fast paced and exciting. The sheer amount of guns, passive items, and references along with the charm of all the NPCs in the game will keep you enthralled for hours. Massive replay ability value of course since every run is different. 

Stardew Valley on the other hand is slow and methodical in terms of gameplay. You can spend your days meeting and conversing with the townsfolk, planning out your farm, fishing, mining and fighting monsters, or exploring the rich and interesting world. A very relaxed game that you can kick back and enjoy an evening with. There's something to be said of the feeling of having crops ready to be harvested and making a profit to be invested in all sorts of upgrades. 

&#x200B;

It mainly comes down to which type of game you want to play, both in my book are amazing games, but for me EtG's replay value is what makes it a far better game. Once you get to a certain point in stardew where money is no longer a problem, the game looses its steam as you can basically buy anything and no longer really have to plan out much. I HIGHLY recommend EtG. If binding of isaac looked good, EtG is even better."
Enter the Gungeon,"Game to relax with - stardew

Game for fast paced action - Gungeon"
Enter the Gungeon,"Apples and oranges, really.

ETG is fast paced rogue lite with bullet hell mechanics and a lot of randomness

whereas

Stardew is slow paced, chill game about taking care of crops and farm animals with a bit of rpg and story elements.

In theory ETG is longer due to randomness but I lost interest after around 10 hours (I played the shit out of the Binding of Isaac though, so it’s not game type which wore me off) but personally I spent around 30h in Stardew obtaining everything I could (note that this is prior to biomes patch).

So. I would recommend both. Just pick an order in which you want to get them."
Enter the Gungeon,EtG. I can’t compare the two but I own EtG and it is the most fun game I’ve played in a long time.
Enter the Gungeon,"I own Stardew Valley, and I alway enjoy playing it when I’m bored or something. One of my favorite parts about it is that you don’t need to focus on farming and you can still get nice amounts of money."
Enter the Gungeon,Enter the gungeon has a steep learning curve but is a fantastic game nonetheless.
Enter the Gungeon,"Gungeon is a roguelike, stardew is a casual farming game. Since they are both awesome games and my bf and I have hundreds of hours in both, you can't go wrong either way my man"
Enter the Gungeon,"Difficulty is a major factor for this. Enter the gungeon is extremely unforgiving, but very fun, whereas Stardew Valley is a much more laidback experience."
Enter the Gungeon,"I own both and don't play either. Here's why

ETG: Really difficult and repetitive. I'm not a hardcore gamer, the hardest game I've beaten are the Bsides for Celeste. I think I logged 15 hours, I was still making progress and still being entertained by the different guns but I wasn't progressing fast enough to stay interested. I got to the boss for level 2 at my peak for anyone looking to discredit me.

Stardew Valley: one of the first rpgs I've ever played. This game was addicting and when I got really into it my perception of time was altered. I was so used to things not happening super fast in that game that when I stepped away I was much more patient. I usually play very fast paced games like rocket league so this change was really cool to experience. I ended up getting into week 1 of summer twice which is not very far. By that time I had such a long list of things to do daily and spontaneously in the game that it became stressful for me to keep track of. I have ADHD and struggle with that sort of thing on a daily basis so I didn't need more of it. Were I not mentally handicapped I probably would have continued to play it. The atmosphere is serene and uplifting. Emotionally many of my expectations for the game were fulfilled before I even played much. The game is about a person that left a corporate job to go do their own thing on a farm they acquired. In real life Stardew Valley was made by one person who similarly had enough security in life to step away from the traditional workplace to develop a game for 5 years. It's a story that is perfect for a generation of people that are increasingly burned out

Hope this helps"
Enter the Gungeon,"I own both. Both are absolutely great. But, they are completely different games lol. If you're feeling like playing a roguelike where you curse your screen because you can't beat the first boss, EtG. If you want to chill out and farm and meet interesting characters, Stardew.

To me however, it seems like your more interested in EtG so I'd go with that for now and pick up Stardew some other time. Even wait for it to go on sale when it's dirt cheap if you're on Steam. I will say that stardew is definitely pretty different from animal crossing especially due to it's farming focus, you can definitely play it less grindy then AC. It's definitely inspired more by harvest moon. Either way tho, both games are worth your money."
Enter the Gungeon,"EtG now, and Stardew whenever you can.

I envy that your first time playing EtG will be at its peak form."
Enter the Gungeon,"Both very different games, so if you're into sick music and continuous action - EtG, if you want a chill gameplay experience where you farm items and build your farm with no action as such - SDV.

There's a sale for anyone interested: [Enter The Gungeon](https://www.gog.com/game/enter_the_gungeon), [Stardew Valley](https://www.gog.com/game/stardew_valley)"
Enter the Gungeon,"Depends on what you're looking for.  Stardew is a much, much slower pace.  Part of the appeal is that you go at your own speed but how much fun you get out of it is kinda on you, takes a little more personal creativity.  If you're more so about mastering the constructs that are laid out for you, Gungeon is fantastic.  It's a hard game and can frustrate some as progress can be pretty slow.  Part of the fun is overcoming that.  So it really depends on what type of gamer you are.  Laid back vs up tempo; more freedom vs a more defined gameplay."
Enter the Gungeon,"They are very different games but both very good. They are both pretty inexpensive and often go on sale. You might consider just getting both.

That said. If you like roguelike games with tight action, then Enter the Gungeon is awesome. There is a ton to do and discover. I prefer a little more progressive leveling up in roguelites but it's still really good.

Stardew Valley has a ton to do as well but it is a very slow paced game. I wouldn't say it's super closer to animal crossing in gameplay but the casual chill feeling is. It's very much inspired by the original Harvest Moon. If you're into casual games with some crafting and building mechanics (minecraft) and a lot of interacting with townfolk (animal crossing and harvest moon) then it's a great game to chill with. 

Both games now have co-op multiplayer aspects in them as well which is nice.

You really can't go wrong with either title. They are gold standards of what indie pixel games should be.

As of writing this they are both on sale on gog.com fyi."
Enter the Gungeon,Stardew vally is a laid back type game where you just take ur time while enter the gungeon is the opposite where it’s fast paced
Enter the Gungeon,"It heavily depends on your tastes. I would recommend EtG over SV without thinking twice, but I know it's not for everyone. If you love roguelikes then the choice  is pretty easy... If you don't like them it's easy as well."
Enter the Gungeon,I own both I think it depends. Gungeon is more of a fast paced time waster and stardew is a very relaxing time waster. Personally I enjoy gungeon more but I like stardew valley a lot except I can only play it on car rides other than that I get bored of it. So imo probably gungeon
Enter the Gungeon,"I've sunk over 100 hours into Enter the Gungeon. Tons of fun, I just always keep coming back to it. I definitely recommend it!"
Enter the Gungeon,ETG
Enter the Gungeon,"Intensity: Gungeon

Relaxation: Stardew

There both great games it’s just really what you want"
Enter the Gungeon,"Enter the Gungeon is a fast game, similar to Cuphead."
Enter the Gungeon,Stardew Valley
Enter the Gungeon,I own both and have played both for over 100 hours so there is no wrong answer
Enter the Gungeon,"ETG is much, much harder than Binding of Isaac. I got farther in an hour of BOI then a year of Gungeon. That said, Gungeon is super cute so I dunno. There’s also Nuclear Throne, which is a similar game."
Enter the Gungeon,"I'm playing Isaac right now and it's been a huge disappointment compared to EtG. I had heard great things about it and so far the gameplay has been lackluster with clunky controls. Can't comment on Stardew as I've never played it but EtG is an absolute blast! Can't recommend it enough, and there is a sense of progression so it is worth it to continue to do runs and unlock new characters, create ""The Bullet"" and unlock new gear. It's an absolute buy for me!"
Enter the Gungeon," 
I'll say gungeon (and Isaac) but if you can buy both."
Enter the Gungeon,Yes
Enter the Gungeon,"Enter the Gungeon is timeless. It's a game i'll never put down for good. I bought it like a year ago and i'll still play it when i pick up my switch. Solid game and a lot of unlockables. Great gameplay, I switch off between this and smash.


Well worth the money and i feel good about supporting the developers as they are all super nice, down to earth and love their community. They are even on reddit and respond to their community. No one else does that.



10/10 game and developer"
Enter the Gungeon,Gungeon
Enter the Gungeon,"They are very different games, and it depends on your preferences, but if I had to choose, I’d go with EtG"
Enter the Gungeon,**BOTH**
Enter the Gungeon,"Definitely get Enter the Gungeon if you want a fun fast paced game.
Get stardew valley if you need a break from life and want to relax."
Enter the Gungeon,Compromise and buy Forager
Enter the Gungeon,Stardew
Enter the Gungeon,Both are life changing. Etg is better for me
Enter the Gungeon,"If you're interested in Enter the Gungeon, you should take a look at Nuclear Throne.  I started on EtG but have been having more fun with Nuclear Throne lateley and playing it more."
Enter the Gungeon,Both
Enter the Gungeon,"I ended up getting Enter The Gungeon and it's addicting I've been playing for hours I'll for sure check out the other games yall said like Nuclear Throne and I will most likely get Stardew on a later date.

The game IS HARD which has me playing crazily to get to the next Dungeon game reminds me of Cup head of Difficulty and gives me some Castle Crasher and Terraria Vibes too."
Enter the Gungeon,Get Moonlighter.
Enter the Gungeon,"i have owned EtG since it was released and Stardew for a couple years now

EtG is amazing but I seriously have like 200 hours in Stardew and I still want to keep playing it

EtG is impressive, mechanically sound and fun - Stardew is a unique, immersive experience and god it really has a place in my heart.

I gotta recommend Stardew here, but at the end of the day both these games are WILDLY different and it really depends on whether or not you want to shoot guns at other guns or harvest crops"
Enter the Gungeon,Why can't fruit be compared?
Enter the Gungeon,Literally why? That game looks good and admittedly I haven't played it myself but only because it's near universally regarded as being disappointing and shallow
Enter the Gungeon,"That's an idiom :)

&#x200B;

[https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/apples+and+oranges](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/apples+and+oranges)"
Enter the Gungeon,Honestly it’s addictive and I feel it’s more challenging than Gungeon..
Enter the Gungeon,"It has generally good reviews from critics and I wholeheartedly agree with what I read before buying. I think if someone is new to Rougelike games then Moonlighter doesn’t bombard them with those mechanics, plus it has a really nice pace switching between the shop management and the looting. I think it’s great for throwing spare hours into. Personally I find it more compelling than stardew, and more relaxing than other action games. 
For reference, my top 3 game franchises are Monster Hunter, Animal Crossing and Pokemon."
War Thunder,You need to play God of War 2018 first
War Thunder,That’s because rdr2 is a prequel get god of war first.
War Thunder,Everyone is saying play GoW first. I agree. I just want to add that it doesn't show it's age at all. Gameplay and graphics are essentially just as good between the two games. I prefer the first one TBH. Skipping the $5-$10 first game to play the sequel is just a waste!
War Thunder,You should definitely play the first PS4 God of War before playing Ragnarok
War Thunder,"Makes no sense to skip the 2018 entry. The story is directly continued in Ragnarok so you’d be missing out on a lot of info and the gameplay is super similar but with a few QOL upgrades and some new stuff, so it’s not like there’s any reason gameplay-wise to skip the first one. You’ll also get it for much cheaper or even for free, considering it’s been available in basically every PS service.

TL;DR: Play the 2018 game first or don’t play them at all"
War Thunder,"1000% play GoW 2018 first, it holds up just as great to Ragnarok, and looks/feels almost as good on the PS5. I don't think the prior trilogy is needed at all but they are good games."
War Thunder,"No, get the first one."
War Thunder,"You don’t need to catch up on the entire series, but I’d play 2018 GoW before Ragnarok. These two games could literally be just one big adventure."
War Thunder,No. You should play 2018 first.
War Thunder,"U played a prequel and think thats the same as a direct sequel?

Nevertheless, its better to play both."
War Thunder,"You should absolutely play GOW 2018 at least, the story has way more impact if you do. If you're able to, I'd say you should also play the 3 main GOW games from the PS2-PS3 Era. I found none of these games to be boring and since they're all one story it's very important to at least know what happens in them."
War Thunder,"100% play GoW 2018 first, but yes you should absolutely play Ragnarok"
War Thunder,"Yeah i would absolutely positively play 2018 first, it just makes Ragnarok SO much better"
War Thunder,"God of War Ragnarok is a direct sequel to the 2018 game.  So much of the relationship between Kratos and Atreus, as well as all of the side characters, develops here that you'll be missing out on a lot by not playing it first.  The game is only $10-20 right now, so why would you rather spend $70 on it's sequel?

The older PS2/PS3 games are not necessary for your enjoyment of the story (though I do think the background knowledge about Kratos can enhance some aspects of his development), but I'd still recommend them anyways as they're all fantastic games."
War Thunder,"You liked RDR2 because it's a prequel. RDR follows John Marston in 1911, while Arthur's story is set in 1899 and the epilogue is in 1907"
War Thunder,"Buy it, but still play GoW 2018. There’s a recap option in Ragnarok but why miss out on more fun? 

And just so you know, the reason you didn’t miss anything in RDR2 without playing RDR1 is because RDR2 takes place before 1, its a prequel with different characters."
War Thunder,All you need to play is 2018 game to understand what’s going on you can also watch a YouTube let’s play of the older games on YouTube if want further context but isn’t necessary to enjoy the game. the only games avaible to play on ps5 is 3
War Thunder,Play 2018 first than Ragnarok
War Thunder,I don’t see any reason to not play 2018. It’s just more to enjoy. Kinda wish I played the 2 games back to back.
War Thunder,"The recap option in Ragnarok is nice but you miss out on some stuff. Would fully recommend you play 2018 beforehand or watch some kind of comprehensive story video about it. That being said, Ragnarok is one of my top 5 favorite games of all time, a few places above RDR2 so definitely play it at some point. I went into 2018 without having played any of the previous games with only some major plot points knowledge and felt like I was missing out on only a little bit of content."
War Thunder,Buy the 2018 game
War Thunder,Play god of war first. It has epic graphics and still to this day good gameplay so you'll not feel like playing an old game. Ragnarok after.
War Thunder,2018 is better and still looks very good.  There is no reason to skip.
War Thunder,The reason RDR2 mightve felt fine before playing RDR1 was because it was a prequel to the first game.
War Thunder,"Play the first one(2018 the old ones aren’t too important to the story) first. This is very much a direct continuation of the story. The examples you gave weren’t hard to follow because RDR2 is a prequel so the story of 1 hasn’t even happened yet(the first one picks up shortly after the end of the second one with John Marston), and Witcher 3 gave Geralt amnesia as a plot device to not exclude players new to the series."
War Thunder,"Unlike red dead 2, you need to play god of war 2018 before ragnarock. Red dead 2 is an entire separate story than the first, ragnarock is a continuation"
War Thunder,You definitely should play GOW before ragnarok. It'll he like jumping into a show in the middle rather than starting at the beginning.
War Thunder,"I would say don't play Ragnarok without playing the 2018 game at the very least.

Ultimately the Norse games are more enjoyable when you know more of Kratos's backstory, but they are designed in a way where you don't have to know any of it, but Ragnarok DOES expect you to know the story of the previous game.

That being said, if you have the ability to play more, I do recommend it. Just don't be turned away from the series if you're not a fan of the way the old games play because it's really very little like the new games. For that reason I often prefer to suggest new players start with the Norse games and then go back to the old games if they want more."
War Thunder,"I’m currently playing god of war ragnarok on my new ps5! I played 2018 in January. I think doing it in order is probably the better idea. With that said, I’m also playing tears of the kingdom before finishing breath of the wild lol so do what you please!"
War Thunder,"In my opinion Ragnarok is better than 2018 in almost every way, including story.. however I would NOT recommend Ragnarok without playing 2018 first. It is a direct sequel and so much that is paid off in Ragnarok is setup in the first one. Absolutely no need to play the original series, but a recap would add some context to who Kratos is - worth a quick YouTube watch"
War Thunder,"2018 makes several references to the original trilogy (and the PSP games), but you don't NEED them, though you might not understand/feel certain moments the way a fan who's played every game would. But don't start with Ragnarok, things will literally not make sense otherwise."
War Thunder,"As others have said in the comments, play the 2018 GOW version first and then Ragnarok. I dont have Ragnarok (yet) but it would be worth your time and fun"
War Thunder,"If time is an issue, make sure to watch a story recap. 

If time is not an issue, play 2018. It's great. (I actually watched a story recap of the previous games before  playing 2018. Not necessary but I thought useful context.)"
War Thunder,Watch recap of the god of wars before 2018 and play 2018. 2018 was a soft reboot of the series so you don't need to know about pre 2018 but some references and kratos past will be confusing. But you would benefit from play 2018 before Ragnarok since the story is interlinked.
War Thunder,All you need is 2018 and you'll be fine.
War Thunder,"your edit is exactly what my dudes at gamestop recommended when i went in looking for my first ps5 game

basically, buy gow (2018) used for ps4 for like ~$10 & play that before getting into gow ragnorak

same thing kind of applies to the horizons games

the hard part is sitting through the play time w/o getting to fully exp the new dualsense features on ps4 titles"
War Thunder,"No. Buy god of war 2018. You can play god of war 2018 without playing the first main three games, but you can't play Ragnarok without playing god of war 2018. They're pretty much one story split into two parts."
War Thunder,"i think you could still enjoy it although the story/characters are 100% better if you understand the first games plot. if you don’t wanna dump 30 hours in the first game tho, there is a recap in ragnorak on the main menu"
War Thunder,"Play as many of the previous games as you can. Kratos's character development is incredible and you won't feel the impact if you skip right to Ragnarok. If you don't wanna play all of them, play 3 and 4. 3 is the conclusion to the Greek Saga and 4 is the beginning of the Norse Saga"
War Thunder,"Yea also from a game mechanics, ui side you should play gow 2018 first. I tried to go back and play 2018 after finishing gowr and it felt weird, the changes made in gowr are subtle but so much better that it may take a while to go back to the 2018 one."
War Thunder,"IMO, GoW 2018 is the only one you'd need to play prior to Ragnarok. But yes, would absolutely recommend both"
War Thunder,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is a prequel, so the only thing to miss is callbacks. Now those callbacks will feel like foreshadowing if you played Red Dead Redemption."
War Thunder,Honestly I’d play them all. There is a lot of story and lore in the new ones that are lost if you haven’t played the rest of the series
War Thunder,"It has “previous in the series” entry cutscene, but i highly do recommend to play gow 2018 first. Story telling here is great and transferring then to sequel feels so much better"
War Thunder,"The original will be like a warmup. Ragnarok literally is more of the exact same, but way way prettier.

And even more so if you're looking for challenge. IMO the superboss in the original was way harder and much, much more satisfying."
War Thunder,I'm playing through Ragnarok now. The story is fantastic. I'd recommend playing the 2018 game first though
War Thunder,Buy the 2005 game
War Thunder,"Well. Rdr2 is a prequel. And no, you should not buy ragnarok because it's a narrative driven game. You're also robbing yourself of the masterpiece that is 2018."
War Thunder,RDR2 takes place before RDR. It would probably be best to play god of war first to get the full story
War Thunder,"Play the 2018 God of War first.

*Ideally* you should play the Greek trilogy first as it really gives additional context and weight to 2018 but purely for understanding Ragnarok, just play 2018 first."
War Thunder,"I never played any god of war games except for 2018 God of war and Ragnarok, I would def play Ragnarok but play 2018 first, both games are basically 2 parts of the same story, even though I never played any before 2018 I was never lost and still consider both 2018 and Ragnarok as one of the best stories in gaming."
War Thunder,"God of war 2018 is free on ps plus I think and if not it’s probably less than $20.

Along with that, it rivals ragnorok in quality, there’s no reason you shouldn’t want to play 2018 first."
War Thunder,Play God of War 3 first
War Thunder,"Oh man, I actually just skipped over the 2018 one and went right into Ragnarok. I got both games for free. Kinda/sorta tried to get into the first one a few years ago but it never really hooked me. I decided to give Ragnarok a go because it came with my PS5 and so far I’m 38% done the story or something like that. I honestly don’t know if I’m gonna finish Ragnarok either as it’s been about a week since I picked it up and I am finding myself less and less interested but I’m confident I know what’s going on and don’t feel out of the loop at all with the story. If you feel you’re gonna get more from playing the first game, do it, but if you get bored halfway through and decide to skip ahead to the new one, it’s really not that difficult to pick up."
War Thunder,God of war is one of the best games out there bro. For sure get ragnorok.
War Thunder,"Ragnarok was my first GOW game and PS5 game, was one of the prettiest games I've ever played and it's no wonder it gave elden ring a run for its money. You should buy it"
War Thunder,"Never played any gow before Ragnarok. Amazing game definitely recommend. They have a recap you can watch before the story, and you can YouTube recaps of the series if needed"
War Thunder,I’ve never played any previous  GoW but Ragnarok came with my ps5. I honestly didn’t enjoy it. Even though it’s exactly the type of game I should enjoy. I can tell the story is great but without playing any of the previous games it’s hard to keep up with sometimes. There is a recap at the start of the game iirc. To me the biggest thing is I felt the combat was clunky.
War Thunder,Imo GOW 2018 is better than ragnarok. It’s more concise and straight forward and epic as fuck
War Thunder,"I'd say at least play gow3 first, or watch the cutscenes or a let's play of the first two and then play 3, but that's just me personally"
War Thunder,"The story honestly is terrible. The gameplay is exactly the same as 1, except you’re force fed 8 hours worth of Atreus gameplay including one segment that lasts for 2 hours and is among the worst areas in gaming history (not exaggerating it’s that bad). However I seem to be in the minority here. It’s a well done game but there are so many story problems and the writing and is honestly laughably bad for several gods involved. One of the most overrated games I’ve ever played. If you can get a discount go for it."
War Thunder,play ER widescreen. youll never need to play another game
War Thunder,"I'm waiting for them to release a dual package with both the latest games on one, like they did with the 1st and 2md Arkham games. This decision based on not even getting 1/2 way through the first GoW, just a taste while available on the PS store."
War Thunder,"You'll still enjoy the game,  but even playing just the 2018 game,  you'll miss a lot of references. That's a lot of missing context."
War Thunder,I would play 2018 and then Ragnarok.
War Thunder,Start from the beginning
War Thunder,Absolutely
War Thunder,"U like the games you mentioned, God of war ragnaroks story relies a lot on 2018

God of wars story doesn’t really rely on the OG god of war games, those are for if you want to know some details and why some things are the way they are, but ragnarok is as direct of a sequel as a sequel can get"
War Thunder,Yes!!!!!
War Thunder,"As a new player, you'd probably like God of 4/ragnarok. I'm more of a classic gow fan personally. It's like old vs new assassins creed for me."
War Thunder,"Play 2018 first, you won't regret it. You will likely end up regretting it if you don't play it though, the impact of the story will be nearly non-existent and you won't be invested in any of the characters or their development. The ""recap"" that Ragnarok includes in the menu does NOT do 2018 justice at all."
War Thunder,"The first PS4 God of War is a masterpiece, story aside, there is no reason to not play the first game."
War Thunder,"Play the first trilogy of mainline games, then play 2018, then play Ragnarok. It is shocking how much the older games tie in to the new ones, and they do add a lot to the experience of playing the later games. They're also just good games in general.

Now one thing you should never do is play Ragnarok before 2018. Ragnarok basically follows up all the plotlines in 2018 directly, so a lot of it won't make sense/have the same weight if you play Ragnarok first."
War Thunder,"Play GoW 2018 first, it would be a mistake to skip it."
War Thunder,"Get GOW 2018 first, then play Ragnarok."
War Thunder,play gow 2018 first and then ragnarok. id rec the older games as well but at least watch some lore videos or something
War Thunder,"I just played the 2018 GOW for the first and put it away after beating the Valkyrie Queen. Honestly, one of my favorite games I've played in a long time. I'm excited to try out Ragnarok when it's out on PC. I highly recommend the game."
War Thunder,The ps4 game is better anyway. Play that first
War Thunder,Definitely. Theres an option in the menu for it to tell you the story of the 1st one. I thought GOW was good but the bosses in it were hit or miss due to its use of reskins. Gow raganrok is one of the best games I've played in a very long time. Its about 60+ hours of solid content and I can't reccomend it enough
War Thunder,No
War Thunder,Play the 2018 god of war first ! That's an amazing game itself
War Thunder,"God of War 2018 would make more sense for the story wise. Rdr 2 was a prequel to rdr 1, so you didn't need to play rdr 1 if you didn't. If you want to see the full story and appreciate it for yourself, I wholeheartedly recommend playing the first god of war before Ragnarok. That's just my opinion on it."
War Thunder,"Actively playing through 2018 now. I played the first 3 within the last few months and I can honestly say I would not enjoy 2018 nearly as much if I hadn't. That said, it isn't necessary but don't touch ragnarok without playing 2018 first."
War Thunder,I envy you
War Thunder,"red dead 2 is a prequel to red dead 1, ragnarök is a direct sequel to 2018 is not the same"
War Thunder,No. Watch a recap of the original games and then play 2018 and Ragnarok
War Thunder,"You need to play God of War 2018 first. Otherwise the story won't make as much sense, nor have much impact."
War Thunder,"Like everyone has already said, definitely play 2018 first, it's pretty cheap these days. 

That said, if you don't feel like playing the Greek trilogy, it might be good to find a recap video somewhere, just so you're up to speed on Kratos as a character. Makes some of the story beats and development in 2018 and Ragnarok hit a bit harder."
War Thunder,"RDR2 was a prequel, so you didn't miss anything. Ragnarok on the other hand is to be played after the original."
War Thunder,"Play GOW 2018 first. It’s designed as a soft reboot of the series so you don’t need to play the older games to pick up what’s going on. don’t look up anything about the story. Just enjoy, then move on to Ragnarok and be glad you didn’t have to wait like the rest of us lmao"
War Thunder,Play 2018 and if you can play the original trilogy.
War Thunder,Just play the first one. They are extremely similar. It's basically part one then part two of the story
War Thunder,"Don't need to play all of them, but definitely play 2018 first. Maybe look up a quick recap of the original series but honestly 2018 could be interesting to play without knowing any additional backstory either."
War Thunder,"Definitely on the witcher end of things if not more so, play 2018 first"
War Thunder,"Everyone is saying play GOW 2018, I’d say, get into the lore to appreciate it. Start from the very first one. If you can’t play them, I think there is a 12 hours video on YouTube or cutscenes from the game merged together to create some kind of movie like story that will get you into the lore fully. You’ll appreciate the franchise more."
War Thunder,Huge recommend GOW 1 first. Second story relies heavily on the one before to even appreciate it. Also my personal opinion is that it’s even better than ragnarok
War Thunder,"Both rdr2 and Witcher 3 are not reliant as being played as a series. They are perfect standalones, and perfect sequels. GoW Ragnarok serves as a perfect sequel that ties the ends of threads that started all the way back in the first game. I HIGHLY recommend you at least play GoW 2018. While the gameplay and characters may not lose too much perfection, every other aspect will be so much more powerful if you play through god of war 1, 2, 3, and especially 4."
War Thunder,"I hopped on the GOW wagon last year. While it's not necessary to play the first, I can only recommend you play GOW then ragnarok because they're both awesome."
War Thunder,ragnarok spoils the 2018 one within the first like 5 minutes. yes play the 2018 one first
War Thunder,"The original games up until 2018 are more so for funsies and basically “what if we had a demigod who had a bloodlust for the Greek pantheon?”

Afterwards in the 2018 game and ragnarok, it gets much, much more story heavy. It throws a wiser and more tempered Kratos into the Norse pantheon. Definitely play the 2018 game first."
War Thunder,"RDR2 was a prequel, of course you can play it if you never played the first one."
War Thunder,"Honestly they have a recap. And if you play it from Atreus point of view. He doesn't know that much about kratos, comparatively to if you freshly played all the games. So it's kinda a cool experience because we only hear what's in game just like Atreus.GOWR was my first GOW game"
War Thunder,"GoW and Ragnarök are one of those games/series that HAS to be played in order. Soooooo much of GoW is building to the events of Ragnarök and without playing GoW, you're doing yourself a disservice."
War Thunder,2018 adds A LOT of context to what is going on in Ragnarok.   A lot of returning characters that had a game to build them up for the emotional impact and first impressions you will get from the sequel.
War Thunder,You can but I would recommend playing 2018 game first but you can watch a recap in GOW ragnarok
War Thunder,2018 is a direct prequel. You’re missing a massive amount of lore that **DIRECTLY** connects to Ragnarök.
War Thunder,"So how do we tell him that Rdr2 takes place before rdr1🤦‍♂️?

And no you should play 2018 to understand the story plus it's a really awesome game"
War Thunder,"You only need to play God of War 2018 to play Ragnarok, and I would say this IS a must."
War Thunder,Totally agree. I even replayed God of War 2018 again before playing Ragnarok.
War Thunder,Not really though
War Thunder,It’s a shame the ps+ essentials bundle ended. That was one of the free games.
War Thunder,This one here.
War Thunder,"Yeah, that's my thought.  Could you theoretically enjoy Ragnarok without playing 2018?  Sure.  But there's simply no reason to.  The 2018 version is on all the same platforms, is just as good, and the story is better if you play the games in order.

This isn't some case where you might not have access to the previous game in the series, or where the sequel's some massive improvement where you might want to jump straight into the better game.  This is just two great games on the same platform that are best played in order.  I can't think of a single reason to start with Ragnarok."
War Thunder,">U played a prequel and think thats the same as a direct sequel?

No. I thought mentioning the experience might help commenters understand the experience I'm looking for. In your case I was clearly wrong. 

Appreciate the advice though, will definitely at least start with 2018."
War Thunder,Both gow 1 and 2 are in the ps store on ps5. Played them all within the last few months
War Thunder,"Second this. I wanted to do the same, skip 2018 in favor of Ragnarok. Just as the recap started in Ragnarok though I said fuck it ad downloaded 2018. Did not regret.

Still haven't played Ragnarok as I haven't beaten 2018 yet thanks to multiple loss of my saved games, but can confirm it's a great time"
War Thunder,"And RDR2 is a prequeal,meaning it comes before RDR1."
War Thunder,I tried to play pre 2018 god of wars but then I remembered I don't enjoy hack and slash as a genre.
War Thunder,"My younger brother tried to play the old god of war games and told me it ""played like some ancient shit""

And I felt old,  because when i played the new game i thought ""wtf happened here?"" To be fair, I loved GOW 2018 but i did sort of miss the old style."
War Thunder,the hack n slash gow are my favorites…these story driven new ones not my cup of tea… especially with that fucking kid
War Thunder,"Play the 2018 game first, Boy."
War Thunder,"It’s not that you can’t understand what’s going on, it just doesn’t resonate with you like it would if you played 2018 first and I bet it’s why you’re not enjoying it. It’s the greatest game I’ve ever played."
War Thunder,I'm drunk asf and i diaagree
War Thunder,"I HATED that Atreus part too. Not to mention you can upgrade him fully after about 30 mins of playing as him, so the rest of the 8 hours feel like a complete grind to get back to the Kratos sections. I also personally never cared for the story & thought it was overrated as well. The whole “father/son” dynamic never clicked with me for these 2 and I don’t really know why. Brok is genuinely the only character I liked, and even he got old really quick. Can only take a handful of fart & dick jokes before they get annoying. 

And I’ll say it. The combat is mid once you get used to the axe throwing. That’s like the only cool thing. And for fucks sake it’s 2023 let me fucking jump."
War Thunder,"Great feedback, thank you"
War Thunder,"I realize that. I was simply iterating what type of experience I'm looking for. If you have no intention to answer the question being asked, there's no need to respond."
War Thunder,"You replayed GoW 2018 because it was an amazing game, not because you wanted to have a recap before Ragnarok, tell the truth..."
War Thunder,"Totally a side question, but how did you use your hacksilver? I haven’t used any money in the stores because I am afraid of upgrading a weapon and then finding a new better one the very next mission. That happens far too often in games so I rarely use stores, but I’m dying pretty often I wonder if I should.

It’s been a few years since I last picked it up because I didn’t know if I should proceed from the store I am at or upgrade. I was going to look up a guide and never got back to it."
War Thunder,"very much worth while tho, even if you have only 1-2 hours to play a day"
War Thunder,"I mean, yeah you do."
War Thunder,"You’ve gotta be trolling, right? The story literally continues directly from the 2018 game."
War Thunder,"Umm it's a direct continuation and constant refers to the first game. So yea you need to play the 2018 game if you care at all about WHY you are doing anything in ragnarok. Bit sure, you can physically just play it. But again, I always played GOW cuz I loved the story so that's my biased opinion."
War Thunder,Are you dense?
War Thunder,Honestly you do. I did all the old gow and started ragnarok with doing the reboot or whatever and didnt understood shit for the first hours. I just stopped and thought i will do the previous one first
War Thunder,"I just found it funny since it cant be compared. 

i would check some videos with story recaps from all the old games first. Or in between, it gives a much better understanding of Kratos. 

Sure you gonna love the game and story no matter what. Have fun"
War Thunder,Well current GOW can still technically be called that but the bigger focus on story obviously helps
War Thunder,"I personally much prefer the newer style even though I'm old enough to have been gaming when the originals came out. Although I didn't play them at the time. My first GOW was 3 Remastered on PS4, and then I went back last year and played all of them (which I had accumulated on PS+ over the years). I still prefer the newer style but can definitely appreciate the older style. What I more think the newer games are lacking are those big epic set piece moments the old series had a lot of. The newer games never quite feel like they get to that level for me. I mean I get that Kratos is trying to shy away from that level of violence, but I really hope that after Ragnarok, he is more willing to embrace that aspect of himself as long as it's used to help people, rather than for vengeance."
War Thunder,"I’ve enjoyed it, but I got bored of the first one after getting a part way through it as well. If you like them, that’s awesome, but they feel like watching marvel movies to me. It’s brainless, smashy-smash time with simple puzzles and a schmaltzy, family-oriented plot that makes you go “aw shucks.” Nothing wrong with it but the graphics are the best part for me."
War Thunder,"Haha like I said man, I’m in the minority here. I thought they disneyed the fuck out of it and the tone completely changed and ragnarok itself was an absolute joke. Huge buildup for nothing whatsoever. Red herrings left and right, Deus ex machinas left and right with no payoff. You know this wasn’t written by barlog? It was a different team and boyyy did it show."
War Thunder,"Yep, he also made Kratos feel so weak by comparison despite fighting the same exact enemies most of the time, finally getting Kratos back and dying immediately was so dumb, also angraboda talked and acted like a gen z tik toker like what the actual fuck was the writing. “Nah you’re not lucky, you’re just loki…” good god."
War Thunder,Truth
War Thunder,I replayed it cuz I wanted to 100% it and it’s a really fun game to 100%
War Thunder,You got me!
War Thunder,"Depends on play style. For me I don’t really think about it, I just upgrade whenever I feel like. It’s good because usually there is tons of hack silver by then. I prioritize high risk high reward style so there’s usually more than enough. It’s the other materials that tends to run out quickly."
War Thunder,"No you don't

You can just skip to Ragnarok. It has way better gameplay and you're not missing anything by skipping 2018"
War Thunder,"He is, he can’t be that absent minded, he is definitely trolling."
War Thunder,"Doesn't matter, anyone with a brain can use context clues and figure out what's going on 

Plus it's a video game, not a movie. The story is just window dressing"
War Thunder,"There’s a fairly comprehensive recap at the beginning of Ragnarok but also, absolutely nothing unexpected happens in either game. They both do tons of foreshadowing and lay out their plots well in advance. It’s incredibly common in movies and TV and a lot of the successful AAA games like RDR2 and Jedi:fallen order/survivor do it as well. It’s popular because it let’s the viewer feel more in control but it can also make games like this feel like you’re just waiting to press the right buttons at the right time. Kinda makes it feel more like DDR or a rhythm game with the plot of a Marvel movie."
War Thunder,Anyone with a brain can just use context clues and figure out what's going on.
War Thunder,Are you ?
War Thunder,It may be “hack and slash” but it’s not hack and slash lol
War Thunder,"Oh without a doubt the newer games feel so much more well thoight out and the play style matches the narrative really perfectly. I would go so far as to say they are definitely the superior games. My love of the old style is entirely personal.

Im guessing im at least a bit older than you, having started with the series at GOW 1 on playstation 2.  It was really sort of a ""bad boy""  game when it came out. Violent,  with the hero not really trying to save the world, but to vengefully, brutally, kill the greek gods. It just felt SO cool.  It was definitely one of the first games i had seen with nudity (and an entire minigame for getting the girls off lol) in 2005 that was just on an entirely different level. You felt like a hyper badass. 15 year old me could not contain himself. 

Also it goes to a deeper thing with me where i just miss the way games used to be made, they felt more like GAMES.  games now are incredible, and some are so much better than those older titles. But there is an old style that i definitely mIss across the board. Though nintendo still nails that old style to this day, quite frequently IMO"
War Thunder,I can’t let you call GoW anything close to marvel even if it’s your opinion lmao that’s garbage. It’s not your thing sure but that’s wrong 🤷‍♂️
War Thunder,I'm kinda sober and i kinda agree now
War Thunder,"Lmaoooo I forgot about that part. Absolutely terrible. Thor was a completely wasted character too, which is a shame because I actually liked how they portrayed Thor."
War Thunder,You're not missing anything?
War Thunder,you're missing the game of the year... there's 0 reason not to play the original
War Thunder,"If you say so. Not trying to change your mind. Just speaking as a fan of the series since GOW 1 on PS2. Agree to disagree, I guess."
War Thunder,"I was 18 when the first game came out. My first consoles were NES and Atari 2600 😜

I just didn't have money for a PS2, and also had a bit of a grudge against it at the time because I felt like it was responsible for the death of the Dreamcast."
War Thunder,"It’s a glitzy revitalization of old property that’s heavy on big, cinematic, “mash x” cutscenes, easy-to-understand combat and a completely linear plot so that it’s accessible to lots of people. There’s nothing wrong with that, just like there’s nothing wrong with Marvel movies being inoffensive, feel-good, action comedies that appeal to the widest possible demographic. It doesn’t mean that you can’t enjoy it on a deeper level if the plot resonates but you can’t tell me that tons of people aren’t just getting catharsis from roleplaying their emotionally distant fathers from it. The whole thing is this absolutely beautiful but insane mishmash or broken little bits of mythology, tossed up with a bunch of modern sensibilities centering a broadly-relatable father/child dynamic with a skin of the same cinematic-action game that’s easy enough to play that it makes a good starting point for people who have never played videogames before. Unfortunately, much like the Marvel series, now the newest addition to the franchise is a direct sequel and much of the fan base will insist that you’ve got to sit through 30+ hours of prior content to truly get the full experience. Also, what is with all of the dwarves having New York accents and Odin and Thor sounding like Chicago?"
War Thunder,Agreed. He was the only god other than odin and heimdall to get a good-ish depiction. Freyr was laughably bad (played by a laughably bad actor) sutr literally said the following when Atreus asked what happens when he becomes ragnarok “I get big and smash stuff…you’ll like it.” I mean how can people downvote me on this shit? You actually liked this stuff?
War Thunder,What are you missing?
War Thunder,Ragnarok is the exact same game except better in every single way
War Thunder,"Haha well shit, a fellow OG gamer. Hello good sir."
War Thunder,the entire story?
War Thunder,I'm genuinely wanting to understand why you're suggestion not to play it. And skipping it. Be a dick then.
War Thunder,not even close to true
War Thunder,"Who cares? It's a mediocre AAA video game story, and anyone with a brain can just use context clues and figure out what's going on in GoWR

It's not like it's some complex deep story"
War Thunder,"How is that not true? They use the exact same mechanics and engine, the difference they actually added enemy variety and decent boss fights which 2018 was lacking."
War Thunder,i care and clearly everyone else in this thread cares. take the stick out your ass and enjoy some good storytelling.
War Thunder,"HEY EVERYONE!

Found us an Xbot ☝️"
War Thunder,"OP cares. He literally stated it in his post. 

He wants it for the story."
War Thunder,"Anyone who says ""it's the same game"" is automatically wrong and their opinion is discounted."
War Thunder,"Give me a break, it's a generic fantasy action story with a cliche father son trope. Not saying the story is bad, but it's just mediocre. The highlight of the game is visuals and the gameplay"
War Thunder,"I gotta say, they’re not wrong. It’s schlock. It’s just really pretty schlock."
War Thunder,"I don't even own an XBox, I have a PS5 and a Switch 

I also like the God of War games, I'm just giving a realistic description of the games"
War Thunder,"Why? It literally has the same basic mechanics, same engine. The only differences are superficial things like a new story (with the same characters) and new levels to explore. It's the same game but better because they fixed the biggest flaws that 2018 had. 

The only things I don't like about Ragnarok are the boring Atreus sections and how the characters spoil all the puzzles"
Castle Crashers,"If you’ve got some buddies to play with, I say go for it. It’s best done in split screen in my opinion. Playing alone can get a little stale."
Castle Crashers,"Ok thanks, I've got a friend to play with"
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,[deleted]
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"Never played Brothers, but yes yes yes to It Takes Two. I just finished playing it with my GF and it was honestly a 10/10 experience. We enjoyed it even more than A Way Out, and we enjoyed that game a lot. And we both played with KB&M (on two computers ofc)"
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"they're both amazing and miles better than a way out, but brothers is not a coop game. it2 is and it's amazing but you have to be ready to do a little no homo because it's quite romantic"
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"I played this on PS3 and highly recommend it. Make sure you play with a controller, though because I can't imagine how this would work on a KB+M.

Some tips:
- Take your time and explore/interact with everything
- It's a short game, like 6 hours-ish?
- try to finish it on a weekend or before a long period of down time. You'll be thinking about the story for a while."
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,Ah so Brothers isn't Coop?
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"Should I wait for the price to decrease or buy it now? And is there also a friend's pass like in A Way Out, where only one has to own the game?"
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"But from what I've seen the main character are hetero, aren't they?"
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,[deleted]
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"Won't say about sales, as I haven't played the game yet, but there is a friend pass similar to A Way Out."
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"Yes, only one has to own the game. In my honest opinion, it's one of the rare games I don't regret buying full price at all."
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,oh yeah I was joking about the fact that it was going to make you fall for your friend
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"Okay. Then I don't need to worry about the controller, cause I have one, contrary to my friend."
Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons,"Probably not, >!such as A Way Out is unlikely to make you kill your friend!<"
Besiege,"But it on steam and play for an hour. If it doesn't run well or you're not into it you can get refund, no questions asked.

The game throws you into building so you'll tell more or less what performance is going to be like pretty quickly."
Besiege,Yes
Besiege,"got it, its fun"
Jazzpunk,RDR2 is an absolute triumph. It MUST be played.
Jazzpunk,"I would generally recommend RDR2, which is one of the best games ever made.

Presentation is absolutely stunning across the board. Graphics, SFX, music, voice acting, all are absolutely stellar.

Gameplay-wise is also phenomenal. Essentially, to summarise, it plays as a 3rd-person shooter, with some RPG and simulation elements - it really shines in making you *feel* like the character you're playing as, that is, a cowboy in the late 19th/early 20th century, with all the gambling, outlawing, hunting, etc.

The content available is frankly some of the best value in any videogame. This is the most well-realised open-world game ever, in my estimation - an immersive world that feels natural and alive, that exists independently of you but reacts to your decisions. The story is fully fleshed out, dramatic, personal and intimate, but also self-aware enough to shine all the wild west tropes through. You have further an entire online mode that I haven't even touched yet.

When considering the preferences you laid out, I'm even more convinced you'll enjoy it. I'd recommend it over cyberpunk to anyone, but even more to someone with your preferences."
Jazzpunk,"RDR2 is probably the better made game but I also loved Cyberpunk, it’s story, and it felt very creative and new. I liked someone else’s idea of doing RDR2 and buy Cyberpunk when DLC comes out so you can transition straight to DLC"
Jazzpunk,"Love both, but I’d start with RDR2 buddy. And just know, it’ll be awhile before you start Cyberpunk once you get immersed into that work and Aruthur"
Jazzpunk,U can miss cyberpunk. U cant pass on RDR2! Easy as that
Jazzpunk,"Rdr2 without a doubt. The most beautiful open world, lots of chill out time, lots of random and very well written scripted quests, a sense of history with a bit of the absurd, and a tragic crime family story. It will give you a thrill, make you feel like a badass, and then leave you in tears."
Jazzpunk,"I’m sure there will be a Complete Edition for Cyberpunk/Phantom Liberty, so wait on that. Cyberpunk was great; loved the story, Night City and the RPG elements. Granted I played on PS5 when that version was released. 

Red Dead Redemption II is one of the greatest games ever made. Five years later and it’s still worth full price. The quantity and quality of content is impressive."
Jazzpunk,RDR2
Jazzpunk,"As someone that was super hyped cyberpunk and hit it day 1, as faulty and buggy as it was at the time on my ps4, I enjoyed it, and now 100 times better with the next gen update and all on my ps5, that being said, RDR2 was one of the best games of the last generation, and it plays great on next gen consoles… definitely recommend RDR2, it’s not an rpg but getting lost in that world and along with the things you discover in it are very rpg like to me, definitely recommend RDR2"
Jazzpunk,"RDR2.

Cyberpunk is cool, but it will be much cooler in a few months with the update/remake

I also would only get cyberpunk if you have at least a PS5/next gen/pc"
Jazzpunk,Red dead redemption until cyberpunk dlc is released
Jazzpunk,"No question, RDR2 all the way!"
Jazzpunk,"I feel like RDR2 is a much better overall game, but is more divisive than you would be lead to believe. It's a slow burn story game, so if you're cool with that, it's way better.

Cyberpunk is exactly as you expect it to look and feel."
Jazzpunk,"Cyberpunk base game is also been a lot of improvements when the DLC releases so get cyberpunk then with the DLC, for now its time for RDR2 Boah!!"
Jazzpunk,RDR2
Jazzpunk,RDR2 without a doubt
Jazzpunk,"Red dead, even though I mostly play rpgs. Even though it’s fairly polished now I just find Cyberpunk to be boring. Idk I hope someday I can engage with it but it’s not now."
Jazzpunk,"RDR2

Cyberpunk is also a very good game, and I do recommend you play it eventually

But with the DLC just around the corner (only three months away in fact) you should wait until it releases before getting it"
Jazzpunk,"Wait for the DLC and play RDR2 while you wait. I personally liked Cyberpunk more, but RDR2 is amazing aswell."
Jazzpunk,"Rdr2 and I liked both of them, but RDR2 is on another level"
Jazzpunk,Rdr2
Jazzpunk,"RDR2 is the most polished game I have ever played. The environments are highly-interactive and the world with it’s animals and people respond to you and each other in a very believable way. It’s story is an engaging epic action-drama grounded in reality. It’s extremely immersive.

CP2077 had very rough beginnings and, when I last played it late last year, that roughness still shows through on what otherwise feels like quite a nice game. Everyone knows about the bugs, so there’s no point mentioning them more here.  The physical environments and sound design are very well set up. But the NPCs populating the world will behave in ways that might break your immersion. When a gun is fired, they will all crouch in the same animation and despawn as soon as you aren’t looking. Police will spawn in on top of you when you commit a crime and don’t put up any chase when you flee. Feels disappointing in a world constructed around the notion of constant police-gang struggle. Supposedly this is slated to be reworked in the future.
The world has some interactivity more on par with games like dishonored 2. Dialogue feels particularly strong and the story is, in my experience, engaging. 
One strange thing is the character customisation. One premise of the world building is ‘fashion over function’. How you look is supposedly as important as how you act on the world of 2077. But this is totally at odds with the actual game mechanics. You will be heavily encouraged to wear clothes for their stats, not their appearance, and that will lead to some pretty weird costume combos. It doesn’t matter much because the game is entirely first person perspective, but that begs the (controversial?) question of why have a player model at all."
Jazzpunk,Yes red dead redemption is much better on many levels right off the bat.
Jazzpunk,Rdr2
Jazzpunk,"Rdr2 100%. In my opinion it’s the best/most realistic video game ever made. The only downside is it’s ruined every game I’ve played after it. Either the graphics look terrible, the story is dumb, gaming mechanics aren’t as good etc.."
Jazzpunk,"Hands down, RDR2. While I enjoyed Cyberpunk for what it is, I don't think that's a close call by almost any metric."
Jazzpunk,"Red Dead Redemption 2 by far; I 100% Cyberpunk 2077, I did not 100% Red Dead.  Cyberpunk doesn't not have a lot of depth, unfortunately, its presentation is good and certainly has gotten better since launch but literally the only time I would even talk about it in the same breath as RDR2 is a question like yours, in terms of quality and depth and content, it doesn't hold a candle to RDR2.

There is of course a difference in setting to consider, but just keep in mind that while the 'cyberpunk' aesthetic is certainly present in Cyberpunk 2077, I'd argue it doesn't even do it as well as games like Shadowrun for SNES or Shadowrun for Genesis.  That may seem harsh, but again I did everything you could do in this game, it really doesn't have much going for it."
Jazzpunk,RDR2
Jazzpunk,"I would wait for the the dlc for Cyberpunk as it seems it will be some kind of mega side quest and will bring improvements to the base game as well, rdr2 is hit or miss I guess depending on people, it's a slow paced game but amazing visuals, story and immersion but with that said I finished cyberpunk and still will come back for the dlc, the game has a pretty big replayability if you like trying different approach to combat"
Jazzpunk,"If you don't mind a slow burn for massive payoff then go for RDR2. You'll want to wait to play CP2077 until Phantom Liberty releases as they're doing an overhaul of the base game too.

Edit: Liberty not Pain"
Jazzpunk,RDR2
Jazzpunk,"No, it's not Next-Gen Optimized, but still RDR2 all day every day"
Jazzpunk,"RDR2 is the superior game in my opinion. Cyberpunk is pretty bland in comparison. However, Cyberpunk has better performance in that, it can run at 60 fps on next- gen consoles (whereas RDR2 is locked at 30 fps) and is better optimized on PC, though still expect bugs. Also, RDR2 can be overwhelming with its size and detail, Cyberpunk is much smaller in scale."
Jazzpunk,RDR 2 if you like a beautiful masterpiece
Jazzpunk,"I just started RD2 on PC about a week ago and it’s absolutely sensational.

I do plan on getting CP after the new DLC comes out tho, and after I finish the main story in RD2!"
Jazzpunk,You like computers or cowboys?
Jazzpunk,"Seems like they’re going to add lots of fixes to the new gen consoles version of cyberpunk along with the expansion, so I think you should play RDR2 until a much better version of cyberpunk is out."
Jazzpunk,RDR2.
Jazzpunk,Red Dead Redemption 2
Jazzpunk,"Wait for the Dlc of Cyberpunk, the game will get a massive overhaul with it"
Jazzpunk,"RDR2 is the most polished game I have ever played. The environments are highly-interactive and the world with it’s animals and people respond to you and each other in a very believable way. It’s story is an engaging epic action-drama grounded in reality. It’s extremely immersive.

Jazzpunk,Red Dead 2
Jazzpunk,RDR2 duh. CP2077 world and setting is unlike anything I've seen before so that's why I liked it but the story and gameplay was just ok to me.
Jazzpunk,"RD2 

Wait for cyberpunks expansion and then get it. It’s a good game on its own. Think Skyrim but in a cyberpunk setting. Yes is failed on some major systems they were supposed to have. Supposedly they are reworking a ton which will drop with the new expansion in September"
Jazzpunk,Red Dead. Definitely Red Dead.
Jazzpunk,RDR 2 hands down!
Jazzpunk,rdr2 for sure!
Jazzpunk,Rdr2
Jazzpunk,"I might get some hate, but i enjoyed cyberpunk way more than i did rdr2. Maybe rdr2 was too tedious for me, or i didnt like the setting so much. Not sure, still a masterpiece though. 
Still id get cp2077"
Jazzpunk,Red Dead Redemption 2
Jazzpunk,RDR2. By a mile!
Jazzpunk,"There has recently (as in, this weekend) been an article about the Cyberpunk DLC. Along side it is an overall of almost every system. The state its in now, Cyberpunk is *fine.* The open world feels so dead and empty, with nothing ever changing. You can stand and watch a NPC for 5 hours, and they will not move from there spot. The gunplay is fantastic, and the story is good, although that's of course subjective) I think part of that will be changing, along with the many other little tweaks they will be making, along side adding the DLC. So I would hold off. 

&#x200B;

RDR2, in contrast is amazing. The story, combat, graphics are wonderful and I don't have much bad to say about the game. My only complaint is the pacing of the story. It drags on a little to much, but at the same time, that's kind of the point? So It seems a weird complaint. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, TL;DR- Buy RDR2, Hold of on Cyberpunk until the DLC is released"
Jazzpunk,Red dead 2. That game is forever in my heart
Jazzpunk,"If you like RPG games, go for cyberpunk. But if you want an experience go for RDR2. Many people say that rdr2 doesn’t have a good story, but I believe that it is amazing. But I think everyone will agree that rdr2 has the best protagonist of all time, Arthur Morgan."
Jazzpunk,[deleted]
Jazzpunk,"It took me almost 70h to complete the main story in RDR2 that is without any side missions or free roaming.

Done the cyberpunk main story a lot of side quests and done some free roaming all under 50h"
Jazzpunk,Both are great but I'd wait for Cyberpunk fixes and qol that come with the expansion so RDR2 first
Jazzpunk,"RDR2 is probably the better made game but I also loved Cyberpunk, it’s story, and it felt very creative and new. I liked someone else’s idea of doing RDR2 and buy Cyberpunk when DLC comes out so you can transition straight to DLC"
Jazzpunk,"I completed cyberpunk 3x with lowered graphics and shit fps. (Roll on phantom liberty with a 3080)

I didnt finish RDR2s first? Second? Act.

Dont get me wrong, I think RDR2 is an amazing game, probably the better one, but these are the facts lol."
Jazzpunk,Rdr2.  Then In September you can get CP when it gets somewhat overhauled by developers
Jazzpunk,Why is that even a question? RDR2 should be the default answer to this.
Jazzpunk,Get both honestly. They are both masterpieces of games. I personally enjoy Cyberpunk a lot more but they are both fantastic in terms of story and gameplay.
Jazzpunk,Cp 2077
Jazzpunk,"I'd go with RDR2 first and, depending on how much free time you have, by the time you're done with it there'll probably be some version of Cyberpunk with Phantom Liberty included. Either way you'll have a great time with both, enjoy!"
Jazzpunk,"I admit that rdr2 is the better made game,  I just got bored by it.  Cyberpunk was way more fun and engaging to me. I played on a pretty good pc, and didn't really have any expectations going into the game,  so I wasn't soured by anything.

Rockstar games kinda just bore me tbh. After playing the ps2 gta games to death,  any Rockstar game after just feels like it plays the exact same."
Jazzpunk,I love Cyberpunk and never had bug issues. You should 100% get red dead as it’s probably the best game ever created.
Jazzpunk,Red Dead Redemption 2 is already a complete game. Cyberpunk still needs polishing and should be even more solid after the expansion comes out in September. RDR2 will hold you until then.
Jazzpunk,"if u have a series console, ps5, or high end pc, get cyberpunk for 30$ plus the expansion for another 30$. if u don't have that, then id say RDR2"
Jazzpunk,"Have both and played both.  
RDR2 is super immersive and so finely tuned - but it is an open world Rockstar game so it's going to be a bit overwhelming, at least it was to me.  
Cyberpunk is also open world but a bit more linear.  It has that Skyrim like maneuverability where things can get wonky but it allows the player more freedom. 

I'd say go for cyberpunk and just play it now so you have an understanding of the game and story before the dlc comes out."
Jazzpunk,"I have both.

Cyberpunk is more of RPG style than RDR2. There's skill points and such to distribute. RDR2 increases stats for you based on what you do.

Cyberpunk's AI have health bars, red dead's doesn't. It's more immersive for that reason.

RDR2 is much slower pace, but has a lot more to explore. The scenery can be breath-taking and sometimes hard to fathom how good it looks. 

Cyberpunk has a lot of nothing, but it still looks pretty cool. Nice graphics.

So far, I like cyberpunk's story but it can seem a bit all over the place.

RDR2 has been easier to follow."
Jazzpunk,"If you just want a decent story with an immersive world and nice graphics, RDR2 is fine for that. It has pretty terrible gameplay, and it's a brain-dead easy game that treats players like they have 60 IQ. If you just want to turn off your brain for 60-hours and play through a decent story, then it fits the bill. Especially if you like the wild west and spaghetti western movies, then you will probably like RDR2. 

Cyberpunk has way better art direction than RDR2, but the game is severely lacking in terms of a lot of its open world systems. It has nowhere near as immersive of an open world as RDR2. The setting and visuals are a lot cooler, but the actual execution isn't there. The combat is not very good, but it's at least better than RDR2 in this area. It also has RPG systems and build variety which RDR2 doesn't have. Overall I'd say just wait until the DLC drops, because apparently they have reworked a lot of aspects of the game. CP2077 really does have a lot of potential, so if the DLC lives up to the hype, then it could be a game changer."
Jazzpunk,I just tried cyberpunk a couple weeks ago off a freinds familyshare and its still super buggy to the point where i wound up getting fed up with the bugs and uninstalling. I would have felt very cheated if it was a game i payed for. So i would go with RDR2
Jazzpunk,"Everyone says RDR2 is the best game ever, but the janky controls are super frustrating and honestly it’s pretty slow at times. I don’t need to watch long animations every time I pick something up or do anything. It’s more cowboy sim than game. 

Tried it 3 times and never make it past 10 hrs or so."
Jazzpunk,[deleted]
Jazzpunk,Both
Jazzpunk,Mount a blade bannerlord has great rpg mechanics you can literally be anything in that world
Jazzpunk,I would only choose Cyberpunk solely because it has next gen support. RDR2 is a fantastic game but lacks that kind of support which makes me personally not touch it ever since I beat it back in 2018.
Jazzpunk,"RDR2. It’s a much more immersive game and story. Cyberpunk is a great game too, but I don’t find the story as good at all. The pros about cyberpunk are extreme weapon customization and playstyle customization with perk trees. When I play RDR2 I feel like I’m in the story, and when I play Cyberpunk I feel like I’m in a gigantic beautiful sandbox game."
Jazzpunk,Cyberpunk
Jazzpunk,"RDR2 is much more story rich and interactive compared to cyberpunk. It only takes around 30 hours to complete the main mission, spoiler alert ( when doing the last mission after doing so you get back to prior of starting the last mission to finish anything else to basically you don't fully finish it). It has nice features, ray tracing, and a nice environment, but RDR2 beats it in every other way. That's from my opinion as i have both and played both for 100 hours plus on each."
Jazzpunk,"Cyberpunk has better writing and combat. Rdr2's world is more detailed, alive and polished. 
I prefer cyberpunk.
Most people seem to prefer rdr2."
Jazzpunk,"RDR2. Ive played both and Cyberpunk really lacks in a lot of areas and i didn’t get much enjoyment from it after completing the main story line. RDR2 however is a game that ive replayed numerous times and spent upwards of 400 hours combined playing, most of it in free roam. Havent even touched the online yet."
Jazzpunk,"Cyberpunk's DLC will remain as a DLC, it seems to be set in a new city, but at this point, nothing can be done about the game's dullness and how unfun it is to play. I played it for 25 hours(right until the 3-race side mission were unlocked), and it's just boring, the plot is mediocre, the fighting, the gameplay are subpar, the only redeeming thing was how beautiful everything looked, and that's it"
Jazzpunk,I would be cautious with RDR2 on PC. I had to get a refund on it due to the game constantly crashing; the issues had to do specifically with the Rockstar games launcher which you are required to use.
Jazzpunk,"Rdr2 is a bit of an ancient game in terms of design. Missions force you to do things one way and if you don’t listen the game fails you. It’s also an aggressively easy game that just feels stiff and clunky mechanics wise. It’s got great voice acting, but I found the world and story pretty dull. Cyberpunk is a far more enjoyable game that gives you choices on how to handle each mission with much better combat and a much more interesting world to explore and a far more interesting story."
Jazzpunk,"This is a hard one, gotta do both haha"
Jazzpunk,neither buy rain world 😈😈
Jazzpunk,RDR2 no contest
Jazzpunk,"Depends, if you're on console I would skip RDR2, it still runs at 30FPS, rockstar doesn't care about next gen update."
Jazzpunk,"Neither, buy doom eternal"
Jazzpunk,I dont like rdr2 at all and like project red games
Jazzpunk,Cyberpunk. Red dead 2 is overrated imo
Jazzpunk,They’re both great go with what interests you more.
Jazzpunk,I've played both and I have some stronger critiques on RD2 than most but would still pick it over CP.
Jazzpunk,"Both games are amazing, i loved Cyberpunk it's story characters, scenery. currently playing RDR2 its really good, both games are great. I'd buy both if i were u"
Jazzpunk,Robots and guns or cowboys and guns
Jazzpunk,"I’d go for Cyberpunk personally. The game is really good as long as you take your time and do the side quests. There are a ton of really compelling stories that get told. I’d wait to play until Phantom Liberty releases though. The gameplay is already good, but it’s rumored they’re going to be shipping big improvements to key systems like the AI and the police systems (and possibly more) with the DLC."
Jazzpunk,I recommend getting both
Jazzpunk,"Both are incredible story games, depends on what you want. If you care about story and characters, go red dead, if you care about combat and replay ability go cyberpunk"
Jazzpunk,"Rdr2, 100000%"
Jazzpunk,Cyberpunk if you want action. Red dead if you don't mind watching a movie in game format.
Jazzpunk,Rdr2 cyberpunk has a lot of problems
Jazzpunk,RDR2
Jazzpunk,Red dead partner!
Jazzpunk,Red Dead is the better game hands down.
Jazzpunk,RDR2
Jazzpunk,Do you want to be a cowboy? If so…follow your heart
Jazzpunk,Cyberpunk has a big DLC coming soon.
Jazzpunk,"With the Phantom Liberty expansion, which overhaul all of cyberpunk. It will great to buy...


But RDR2 is a moderm masterpiece so it gets my vote"
Jazzpunk,"Cyberpunk is more action and adrenaline, Red Dead Redemption 2 is more laid back and slow-paced.  


Cyberpunk has been getting updates continually since release and is awesomely upgraded by this point...I never finished RDR2, but I finished Cyberpunk and am waiting at the edge of my seat for Phantom Liberty, which is going to be a *huge* DLC and should be later this year.  


Cyberpunk.  My two cents."
Jazzpunk,"RDR2, it's much more detailed and alive rather than cyberprank, tho I enjoyed cyberprank (played from friend's console) its just not within the same level of RDR2 also the balancing of story telling and action on RDR2 is peak unlike in cyberpunk you're always just sitting and listening"
Jazzpunk,I don’t usually post on reddit but i just want to make sure that you get RDR2
Jazzpunk,"Both are great, but I think Cyberpunk is the more engaging game. Red Dead suffers from the antiquated Rockstar game design. Almost no freedom during missions, you’re just railroaded through each section and must play it as the developers intend."
Jazzpunk,Red dead 2 is my pick. Cyberpunk was fun but i can’t just sit back and enjoy the world like i can with RDr2
Jazzpunk,"In my opinion, Red Dead Redemption 2 was an incredible experience, especially in the beginning and middle game. However, I found myself getting bored after reaching around 60% completion, as there weren't many new things to explore once I had acquired the best weapon. 

On the other hand, Cyberpunk had superior writing and enjoyable gameplay, but it did suffer from some noticeable bugs."
Jazzpunk,"RDR2 and anyone who says diff is crazy ive completed both games and theres just nothing that compares to RDR2 everything about it is so amazing but for me my fav thing about the game was the story telling. the best storytelling ive ever experienced in a game hands down. it could of been a oscar winning film. i literally cryed during a few scenarios in the game,"
Jazzpunk,Lol EASY choice. RDR2.
Jazzpunk,Are you on pc ? If you don’t wanna keep the games forever. I can tell you how to get them for like 2$ both on steam
Jazzpunk,"I vote rdr, as well. BUT, if you haven't played Witcher 3, that's another great one. Plus, it often heavily discounted."
Jazzpunk,RDR2 and its not even close
Jazzpunk,"Red dead 2. There isn’t a game that has immersed me more than this game, I play butt nekkid and pretend I’m a O’Driscol. 10 Cowboys out of 10"
Jazzpunk,"I’ve played both and loved both, but I fully believe that RDR2 is truly the best game ever, go with that first!"
Jazzpunk,"Rdr2 is very pretty and has some interesting things in it but from a gameplay perspective it's unbelievably barren. You don't even get to aim your gun in this game really and all the missions are basically ""walk here, listen to dialogue, kill guys"".

Cyberpunk at least has some depth to combat. It's a passable first person shooter. Not a great one mind you, but it works. The missions here are also just ""walk here, listen to dialogue, kill guys"".

Personally the dialogue in both these games puts me to sleep and that's like 70% of both. But I guess I would say the Rdr2 dialogue at least feels finished, whereas the cyberpunk dialogue very frequently feels like a placeholder."
Jazzpunk,RDR 2 is a no brainer in this case
Jazzpunk,"Cyberpunk over RDR2. While RDR2 is a great game, i found it slow, and alot of the “immersive” mechanics being pretty surface level and just boring. Unpopular take, but Cyberpunk is more fun."
Jazzpunk,I’d wait till the new expansion for CP2077 comes out. It’s supposed to bring a whole bunch of QOL changes to the base game.
Jazzpunk,RDR2
Jazzpunk,No
Jazzpunk,"RDR2 was fun, but I was more hyped for Cyberpunk 2077. Ended up not caring for RDR2 so much after burning myself out on it, but Cyberpunk absolutely failed me in almost every department. RDR2 is the way to go."
Jazzpunk,"Wait for the cyberpunk dlc to drop before you buy since they are redoing A LOT of the mechanics. I believe it’s September 26 so you have a lot of time to finish red dead. Plus the summer sale is soonish I think so you might be able to get the game and dlc for cheap depending on what price they set. 

I’ve played both and even though it’s been a while since I played cyberpunk and I just finished red dead 3 days ago both are excellent games in their own right but I’d probably play red dead before cyberpunk."
Jazzpunk,**\*\*\* me scrolling through the comments to find the crazy psychopath that chooses cyberpunk over rdr2 \*\*\***
Jazzpunk,Cyberpunk is fun but it doesn’t come close to RDR2.
Jazzpunk,"It depends on what type of games you like, red dead is more story based and polished, but cyberpunk is more ""fuck around and break the game"", but in a good way

Cyberpunk has leveling and a skill tree, and rdr doesn't, so I think you'd like it more

Also red dead was built with miracles or something because it runs like a dream"
Jazzpunk,[removed]
Jazzpunk,Both games are really good but RDR2 is my favourite game all time so pick RDR2
Jazzpunk,"Both are great, but RDR2 is looong but with lots of content"
Jazzpunk,Rdr2
Jazzpunk,Cyberpunk is more fun. RDR2 gets crazy tedious
Jazzpunk,"Red Dead 2 is worth its weight in gold. The story is perfectly told, with some of the best voice acting I've ever heard in a video game. The world is vast, and you never feel like you're completely out of things to do. Bored of missions? Hunt some animals for upgrades to both your player or your camp. Tired of hunting? Put your criminal mind to robbing a store or train. Want to help the law? Check the local sheriff's office for a bounty. The list of activities goes on and on...


So to answer your question, take a break from the cybernetics and neon signs of Night City and go on a breathtaking journey through late 1800's America with Dutch Van der Linde and the gang!"
Jazzpunk,"Go with red dead and play cyberpunk after the last dlc comes out. There will probably some sale for a definitive edition down the line.

Both games are definitely worth to be played."
Jazzpunk,Do you prefer cowboys or cyborgs
Jazzpunk,Finished Rdr2 3 times already and would pay 200$to forget everything and start the game again without remembering anything. Cyberpunk I enjoyed the story but the game was full of bugs and lost the interest of playing it again even if it is fixed or not
Jazzpunk,"I played red dead 2 after it had been out for like 4 years not expecting much. I didn't even buy it, I played my brothers copy, that's the only reason I tried it. It turned out to be my favorite game ever. I'm not particularly interested in the wild west. It felt like watching a movie in the best way possible. It's the only game I can think of where I was sad because I knew it was ending soon. I can't recommend it enough.

I was excited for cyberpunk for years. I was incredibly disappointed when I finally was able to play it, I put about 20 hours in it and feel no urge to continue playing it. Even after they've patched it."
Jazzpunk,"All you need to do is listen to the song ""Video games"" by Tenacious D. You're welcome."
Jazzpunk,RDR2. Cyberpunk's getting totally reworked head to toe alongside new DLC in September and *that's* when you should buy it.
Jazzpunk,RDR2
Jazzpunk,rdr2
Jazzpunk,RDR2!
Jazzpunk,Hmph. Rdr2 is a masterpiece. Cyberpunk quite literally is bad. Phantom liberty sounds very promising on paper but we’ll have to see. So did this game pre release and I’d give it a 5/10.
Jazzpunk,Is this post by OP a joke?
Jazzpunk,RDR2
Jazzpunk,"Rdr2 has a much stronger plot and cast. And the world is gorgeous.

Cyberpunk is also fantastic and a lot of fun, BUT it’s a lot more you having to role play the character"
Jazzpunk,"Loved both, but like everyone has already said, start with RDR2. CP2077 is a fantastic game, but it will get better once the Phantom Liberty update comes out."
Jazzpunk,Rdr2 all day. By far my fav game all time.. online sux d tho.
Jazzpunk,I couldn't get into RDR2 personally. I was enjoying the story and it's the most beautiful game ever made but I thought the gameplay and controls were so rudimentary I stopped at Chapter 3. Meanwhile I really liked Cyberpunk especially the story and although its gameplay isn't groundbreaking it didn't stop me from finishing the game.
Jazzpunk,"Red dead, no doubt."
Jazzpunk,RDR2 is one of the best games humanity has ever witnessed
Jazzpunk,"Most people are saying RD2, but my vote is for Cyberpunk. Bugs aren't as bad now, and the story is great. Along with a bunch of different builds. You can be a ninja with a katana, a run and gun madman, or a tech savvy hacker. The atmosphere is great and helps tie everything together, and the characters you meet really make it amazing. Just like all of CDPR's games, they really go all out with side quests and side story characters. Plus, Phantom Liberty releases in September, so if it's on sale, I would go for it. Cyberpunk is by far one of my favorites, and honestly, RD2 doesn't even get close to my top games.
That being said, both Cyberpunk and RD2 are both amazing games. I just lean more towards Cyberpunk."
Jazzpunk,"I say pick up Cyberpunk, it might be worthwhile to play the game now, with the original story, before playing Phantom Liberty. As Phantom Liberty is very likely going to come with some new endings, and possibly some other changes outside the ones we already know.

Plus I just think its a good game, well worth the money nowadays after 1.5. Mods make it even more fun to play around with. Just an entertaining experience.

On top of that Cyberpunk is truly an RPG, it lets you choose your skills, pick different perks, use different weapons. You truly build your character the way you want. Its very similar to thinks likeSkyrim in that way. Where as Red Dead 2 is just the same character no matter what, there is no leveling system or anything. Its really more of an action adventure title than a true RPG. 

So if you want to get immersed into an RPG and its setting, in similar fashion to things like Skyrim, I recommend 2077."
Jazzpunk,RDR2 with no hesitation and do not read spoilers.
Jazzpunk,"Hey unpopular opinion time. I played both.

RDR2 is certainly a marvel. The story is amazing, graphics are second to none, the protagonist is probably the most well flushed out I've ever experienced in a game, and overall the game really is a must play.

....but it's a bit of a drag yeah? It's very slow paced, and I found myself just wanting to play other games from time to time. This isn't really a negative point, and is definitely subjective, but man it can DRAG. 



Cyberpunk (post patches) is a wild ride. The story is a blast, and really kicks. The set pieces are way above what I expected in an open world game. The side quests, as expected from CDPR are just as good, if not better than the main story in many cases. Definitely a case of art direction trumping graphical fidelity. While it doesn't look bad by any stretch... Walking though Chinatown in the middle of the night is a sight to behold. Vibrant neon lighting, crowded streets, some guy getting mugged in an alley, the constant cacophony of people shouting and talking... I haven't felt that level of immersion in a game... Maybe ever.

Yeah it's a bit of a mess. But way better than the sum of its parts. Unfortunately I listened to the online griping, and missed out for longer than necessary, but take from someone who was hesitant, it blew me away.

At the end of the day Cyberpunk is just ***fun***. The shooting is chunky and effective, the driving is arcady but feels good, the plot and characters are fucking bonkers, and there really are just so many ways to play the game.

I played it the first time as a learning curve. A little hacking, a little shotgun, a little melee. It was pure chaos and really felt like I was a newbie in night city trying to climb to the top.

Second time thru and I'm playing full stealth. Feels like a totally different game. I walk in an alley, activate my speed implant, turn invisible, and walk through putting a bullet in everyone's head. Come out the other side, and watch the bodies drop before the cameras ever had a chance to catch me. Suddenly I felt like an elite level assassin that was born and bred in this world.


You can't go wrong either way, but I tip towards CP"
Jazzpunk,"cyberpunk, rdr2 is a linear game in an open world setting with the most boring chapter 1 in existence, also everything you do (pointless animation) is so slow and infuriating that you can fall asleep"
Jazzpunk,I think rdr2 has more replayability if that matter to you as far as stretching your dollar. I dont find myself excitingly opening cyberpunk. I felt like 1 playthrough was enough to get a big grasp of the game.
Jazzpunk,"Rdr2 is a masterpiece. It’s slow paced but if you adapt your speed to it, rather than trying to force it to your speed, it’s fantastic! It is the most alive environment of any game I’ve played. Can interact with just about everything too. And npc’s actually seem like they are more than objects moving around the screen."
Jazzpunk,RDR2 is one of the greatest games ever made.
Jazzpunk,"I have both. The answer is both. Just get both, play them both for less than two-hours each, and refund the one you don’t want."
Jazzpunk,"Unquestionably RDR2 is the better, more fully realized game. 

I think the best question to answer from a prospective standpoint, however, is what is your preferred gaming experience? Do you like 'slow' as a concept? Do you enjoy being diverted from whatever you initially planned doing? If a game world is both fun and immersive, are you happy with killing an hour or two wandering around it and not focusing on story progression? If yes to all of the above, You will love RDR2. If you are very task oriented and want everything to be a quick hit, then RDR2 isn't going to be your cup of tea regardless of its (excellent) level of quality.

That's generally what people mean when they say this game is divisive. The less patient get frustrated with its deliberateness."
Jazzpunk,Wait until the Cyberpunk expansion comes out at a discount. It will probably be in its best state at that point.
Jazzpunk,"Red Dead 2 all the way. It took me like 3 attempts of replaying the beginning before I finally got hooked on the game and I wish it didn’t cause I’ve been missing out! 

It’s such a beautiful game. The guns are dope, (just experiment, you can’t lose unless you don’t like the gun which you can just store away) and the world is vast but alive

Like you’ll suddenly get ambushed or some fools will try to rob you; or woodcutters are felling trees, or a criminal is complaining on the back of a horse tied up"
Jazzpunk,I played both RDR2 on s a great experience but a little slower pace. Cyberpunk was broke and I fell off before I completed it
Jazzpunk,"Both are on sale pretty often but I would do RDR2 first without question. There are certain games you absolutely have to at least play. Don’t have to finish it if it don’t click but it’s an absolute must play. Cyberpunk is a great story with not the best gameplay, plus very raunchy. It’s gotten much better over the years however."
Jazzpunk,Red dead 2 is leagues better imo
Jazzpunk,Rdr2 is probably the best story in a game I have ever played. Full stop. It is genuinely one of the most amazing game stories there is. I would recommend it over cyberpunk based on that alone
Jazzpunk,Red Dead 1st by far
Jazzpunk,"Imo they are both very enjoyable from a story and gameplay angle. Some of it comes to taste (do you want a Wild West game or futuristic urban environment?). In my opinion you can’t go wrong but there is a reason Red Dead 2 is considered one of the greatest single player games of all time. 


Also, if this matters, cyberpunk is a 30-50 hour game if you complete the story and do a lot of side quests. Red dead 2 is more of a 50+ hour kind of game."
Jazzpunk,RDR2
Jazzpunk,I would say red dead now and cyberpunk later
Jazzpunk,"Cause I don't play video games no more
Never play video games
But Red Dead Redemption 2, that is not a game
It's an incredible journey through old American history
Fighting for your life and fighting for your family
Try to live your days with honor and integrity
That's not a game, that's an adult thing
That's not a game at all
That's like fuckin' Shakespeare
- Jack Black"
Jazzpunk,"Objectively RDR2 is the better game in almost every way, and it’s also cheaper right now. But man I can’t help but absolutely adore cyberpunk, even more than red dead. My brain says get red dead but my heart says get cyberpunk"
Jazzpunk,"Cyberpunk is pretty cool, but RDR2 is a goddamn masterpiece."
Jazzpunk,"If you like first person action RPG and sci -fi allot like I do Cyberpunk carried the magic. After the millionth plot twist I gave up on Rdr2, cyberpunk is short sweet and tragic."
Jazzpunk,I would say get red dead. It honestly looks like the better game out of the two and you can always get a refund if you really don't like it.
Jazzpunk,"Red dead 2, 100%"
Jazzpunk,Could not put RDR2 down finished in under a month. Cyberpunk took me at least 4.
Jazzpunk,99.9% of time my answer to this sub is just r/piratedgames
Jazzpunk,rdr2 all the way
Jazzpunk,Red Dead Redemption 2 !
Jazzpunk,Rdr 2
Jazzpunk,Both are amazing and should be played but get rdr2 first and wait till the new dlc to get cyberpunk.
Jazzpunk,"RDR2 is to date the best single game I’ve ever played by far.

It’s a masterpiece."
Jazzpunk,RDR2. Without a doubt.
Jazzpunk,RDR2
Jazzpunk,Do you want rootin tootin cowboy shootin or stressy messy cyborg depressy?
Jazzpunk,"I love both, but cyberpunk is good and RDR2 is next level amazing."
Jazzpunk,"In between missions, RDR2 is quite therapeutic to play."
Jazzpunk,"Late to the party, but would like to share my thoughts:

CP2077 has some fantastic writing and beautiful graphics. That being said, it’s a very shallow game in every other department. Given the world-building, it has amazing potential. If they had just given the game another couple years to incubate, it easily could’ve been one of the greatest action-adventure RPGs of its time. 

RDR2 is, on the other hand, *also* a game that has fantastic writing and beautiful graphics. It is, however, the type of game that *did* get the time it needed to fully flesh out all the other aspects of its gameplay. The result is a highly immersive experience with a lot of replayability and content that can last you hundreds of hours."
Jazzpunk,"It's not even really a fair comparison. 

RDR2 is a ridiculous rich and developed world with unbelievable detail (sometimes to much) and a story that is extremely engaging. It also has some of the best NPC reactions/interactions and is probably one of the top 3 hunting games in the last decade all rolled into one.

Cyberpunk is a mostly dead world with poor interactivity with npcs, a convoluted story that barely makes sense, and is almost entirely empty. I know I mentioned dead and empty twice but it needed repeating. The game had so much potential it didn't live up to its ridiculous. The games AI is almost as bad as basic vanilla skyrim back in the day. Luckily most of the bugs seem to have been dealt with but the game is still not worth buying in my opinion"
Jazzpunk,I've played both. They're both pretty good. Rdr2 is the best of the 2.
Jazzpunk,def red dead!
Jazzpunk,I have never met someone who didnt like rdr2 but cyberpunk seems to be hit or miss i have friends who love it but i have had no enjoyment playing it at all
Jazzpunk,"Cyberpunk is one of my all-time favourites, but Red Dead II is objectively the GOAT"
Jazzpunk,RDR 2 and don't think twice. Cyberpunk is good but RDR2 is a masterpiece and goated.
Jazzpunk,"I haven't played Cyberpunk yet, but RDR2 is a must play. I held off on playing RDR2 for a long time, due to people saying its slow paced. That was a mistake. I didn't feel slow to me, because the story is so good. If it was a movie, it would get an Oscar."
Jazzpunk,Rdr2 first and then cyberpunk
Jazzpunk,RDR2 no contest
Jazzpunk,RDR2 is at minimum a top 10 all time must play game
Jazzpunk,Red dead is wayyyy better than cyber.
Jazzpunk,"10/10 ""wild west"" (kind of) open world with a 10/10 story or a, well, cyberpunk open world with a 9,5/10 story


your call"
Jazzpunk,"Rdr2 is amazing. Cyberpunk is great and one of the better open world games I've played ever. I've played a lot of games and I adore this game. Wasn't perfect obviously with the console bugs but it's still great. If you're on pc then get it,next gen consoles then yeah. Previous gen then definitely no. 

After playing both, I can say both are great and damn good games. RDR2 is a masterpiece and Cyberpunk could one day end up being remembered as one. If not for the bugs and launch issues then kt would've been perfect imo"

Jazzpunk,"Cyberpunk is one of the more fun games I've played in years.  Red dead redemption 2 is the single greatest game I've ever played. Play both, but start with red dead."
Jazzpunk,How much is rdr2? I just bought it for $70? 😭😭😭😭
Jazzpunk,Anyone who is a gamer must play RDR2
Jazzpunk,Cyberpunk. That's just me though. This is really a question you need to ask yourself.
Jazzpunk,"Well I would say both, but I would suggest leaving cyberpunk aside until Phantom Liberty comes out and you can experience it at its highest. So for now, I recommend Red Dead. It's very fun, finished it recently, couldn't put my controller down, one week of my holiday gone, spent 110 hours on the game. Just don't overwhelm yourself and don't rush too much with the story, just enjoy the game's atmosphere and its randomness and progress in the story in whatever way feels best to you.

If you worry about completionism, I recommend making a manual save for everytime you start a new chapter."
Jazzpunk,Cyberpunk has finally gotten out of the shadow of its launch and is finally the game it was promised to be. But RDR 2 would be Rockstar’s masterpiece if the first game and GTA V didn’t already exist. Definitely check both games out but give Red Dead Redemption 2 a try first.
Jazzpunk,I liked Cyberpunk a lot but RDR2 is the way to go
Jazzpunk,Cyberpunk only because it going to get a overhaul that makes the game worth playing but red dead 2 is hella fun as well so wouldn't blame you if you got that over it since cyberpunk started off bad and kept people off it.
Jazzpunk,RDR2. It has an amazing story.
Jazzpunk,I haven't played Cyberpunk but RDR2 is such a masterpiece so that's my vote :)
Jazzpunk,Red Dead Redemption is a masterpiece. Cyberpunk in its current state is fine but nowhere near RDR2 level.
Jazzpunk,RDR2
Jazzpunk,"I played both, and 110% would pick RDR2 over cyberpunk. I think I’ve replayed it 4 times now. Played through Cyberpunk once and haven’t felt much like going back. Just a richer story in RDR2."
Jazzpunk,"i know everyone and their mom has already said it in this comment section, but i’m gonna add my voice to the choir anyways: rdr2 first, without a doubt."
Jazzpunk,RDR2 is great. would never spend money on cyberjunk
Jazzpunk,Rdr2 is slow as fuck cyberpunk is fast paced so i would go for cyberpunk (haven't been a fan of slow paced walking and riding Sims no matter how good the story is if they can't give it to me in a faster manner or keep me retained i ain't bout that)
Jazzpunk,RDR 2
Jazzpunk,"Wow, someone needs to rep cyberpunk here.  I loved it.  Best game of last 5 years for me.

Rdr2 was boring for me.  Scenery was pretty and all but I just found it repetitive.  Ride horse, shoot, do boring camp stuff, etc.  I dunno I like doing that stuff in real life.  

Cyberpunk is just super fun.  The soundtrack bangs.. you get swords implanted in your arms... the lore is super interesting.. lots of meaningful choices.  It's the only game I've ever replayed 

CP got a bad rap at launch.  I get it.  But on PS5 today it rocks"
Jazzpunk,"Cyberpunk will have a GOTY edition either with Phantom Liberty’s release or shortly thereafter. Acquiring RDR2 right now makes more sense, at least to me."
Jazzpunk,Buy rdr2 and when cyberpunk gets a complete edition buy that one later on
Jazzpunk,Both are incredible. I would not recommend getting Cyberpunk on a PS4 as it just stops working for me after like an hour of play time. RDR2 is a considerably better game but both are worth it
Jazzpunk,"Play RDR, then go to the second one - you won't regret it."
Jazzpunk,"I'm playing Cyberpunk rn and while id say it is a very good game and looks incredible, it is still nowhere near as polished as RDR2, combat, movement, interactions, npcs, customization and most of the things that make an open world/exploration game good are better in RDR2 in my opinion. But id still recommend you to get Cyberpunk later, it is a great game."
Jazzpunk,"Red dead 2, Cyberpunk isn't bad now, but RDR2 still has a good case for being the best game of all time."
Jazzpunk,I would get RDR2 first. Its long game with a much better story imo. Plus cyberpunk is getting that expansion in a few months that'll be overhauling some gameplay mechanics.
Jazzpunk,Cyberpunk.
Jazzpunk,"Red dead’s storymode is god tier, online can be amazing, Cyberpunk is very good, Perosnally I’d say red dead if you’ll play the online, cyberpunk if ur not gonna play the online"
Jazzpunk,"I say it depends on your system. I have a PS4 slim and cyberpunk is unplayable after the last large update. Gonna have to get a ps5 to actually play it. Could be my save corrupted somehow, but the game freezes after 20 minutes almost religiously."
Jazzpunk,RDR2 is one the best video games ever made. Definitely go for that first.
Jazzpunk,RDR2 any day of the week.
Jazzpunk,"Play RDR2 first and then buy Cyberpunk when the new expansion drops. I love both games, but it sounds like CP2077: Phantom Liberty will be the definitive edition"
Jazzpunk,"I would recommend both, but you need to play RDR2 if you haven't first"
Jazzpunk,Red dead redemption 2 a million times over cyberpunk
Jazzpunk,"RDR2, absolutely."
Jazzpunk,"I think cyberpunk and the expansion are on sale right now. But I’d go for rdr2 first considering it will be more instant gratification then having to wait till December for the expansion on cyberpunk, which will have a ton of new content meant to make the experience way better."
Jazzpunk,"Cyberpunk is poorly written, rdr2 is a masterclass"
Jazzpunk,RDR2 by a mile
Jazzpunk,"I played both games this year. I haven't finished Cyberpunk yet but it's pretty fun, I love everything about it except for some game breaking bugs and funny braindead AI. Both games are great but RDR2 is a triump; storytelling, characters, sound design, voice acting and impressive life-like world with a lot of details and hidden gems in it although gameplay is your standard Rockstar game, it's still an immersive game."
Jazzpunk,"I would recommend that you never buy cyberpunk and if Red dead is your thing, go for it. (It’s not my thing. But seriously, don’t buy cyberpunk.)"
Jazzpunk,Definitely Red Dead Redemption 2. Best game i have ever played since 2006
Jazzpunk,"huge cyberpunk fan here, i'd probably buy it when phantom liberty comes out since they're overhauling everything. RDR2 however was a masterpiece when it came out. definitely grab it, especially if on sale"
Jazzpunk,RDR2 will make you question if any game you ever played was good at all.
Jazzpunk,"Fair warning. I also say RDR2, BUT you need to go into it realizing it IS intentionally slower paced. Take your time with it, really invest in the characters and just hang out in the world, exploring and such. However, that said, I absolutely LOVE RDR2. It’s my favorite of all time."
Jazzpunk,Rdr2
Jazzpunk,"Both are really good 

I really enjoyed RDR2 a lot but Cyberpunk has something that really made me love it. 

I don't know if it's the setting or the overall dystopian world but it's a really great experience now

Plus Phantom Liberty is coming in september I believe so it might be worth a try"
Jazzpunk,"Both are on par and considered masterpieces of their own, CP story is more complex and fast paced while RDR2 is more of a slow burn kind of story. I think that CP is the superior game but I think you should buy both."
Jazzpunk,"Imo RDR2 is superior in essentially every aspect, I would definitely try it out."
Jazzpunk,Get both
Jazzpunk,"Definitely RDR2, seriously it contains the best protagonist you’ll ever play."
Jazzpunk,"Red dead is a must - cyberpunk is a should, so play RDR 2 first, then when the DLC is out pick up cyberpunk"
Jazzpunk,RDR2. I played both but for me RDR2 is just better.
Jazzpunk,"RDR2 barring it’s online is easily one of the best games ever made in my opinion. Same goes for RDR1, which can be played in either order. On top of that there’s undead nightmare as an added plus"
Jazzpunk,"I love both. But if I had to choose, it would be RDR2"
Jazzpunk,"Honestly both are really great games, you should pick based on what type of world you would like to dive into. Dystopian future, vs movie western."
Jazzpunk,Rdr2 killed my parents. We’re happily married now.
Jazzpunk,"RDR2 for sure!!!! I'm playing it again right now. Easily in my top 10 greatest games of all time. And with the amount of games I've played over 30+ years, that is really saying something."
Jazzpunk,Honestly they are both amazing In their own rights. RDR2 is considered one of the best games of all time tho so it’s an easy pick
Jazzpunk,"Obvious answer is rdr 2 first, but let me say this. No open world game will ever be the same after rdr2. Its miles ahead any game ive played to this day, technically and story wise."
Jazzpunk,"Both games are amazing. You can't go wrong with either - great storyline, great side quests, you can just dig yourself in for hours and hours. I'd highly recommend both. But if I had to pick one, I'd say RDR2. It left a bigger impression on me after finishing it."
Jazzpunk,"RDR2 is probably the better game from a technical standpoint, but I found the controls kind of kludgy to be honest.  I beat it once and have never felt the desire to replay it.

Cyberpunk on the other hand is the kind of game I can beat then immediately want to start a new character.  Yeah, it's undoubtably not as polished, but I just had more fun with it.  (Again, a big part of this probably just comes back to the controls, which were a lot smoother in Cyberpunk.)

Honestly...  You should just  get them BOTH!"
Jazzpunk,Rdr2 is easily the greatest console game ever made
Jazzpunk,"They’re very different games which is something to bare in mind. However, RDR2 is a much more polished product. I’d play that first and then pick up 2077/Phantom Liberty because they have basically said that the entire game is getting overhauled and polished with the next update/DLC in September. Both games will grip you emotionally as they’re very well written"
Jazzpunk,I played through cyberpunk twice. I stopped playing RDR2 when I got bored of riding my horsey.
Jazzpunk,Cyberpunk. Honestly RDR2 kind of bored me
Jazzpunk,And I will play it. Thanks for the reply.
Jazzpunk,Yeah what else is there to say? Although Cyberpunk is very enjoyable
Jazzpunk,I would say portal is a triumph.
Jazzpunk,"Sure, I guess then RDR2 it is. Thanks for the reply."
Jazzpunk,I won't pass on either but I guess first I will go through RDR2. Thanks for the reply.
Jazzpunk,I didn't feel the same. What is so unmissable about red dead for you?
Jazzpunk,To be honest it really depends. Personally I felt Red dead was a little to realistic for me and Cyber punk was more actiony.
Jazzpunk,">It will give you a thrill, make you feel like a badass, and then leave you in tears.

beautifully said."
Jazzpunk,Yes.
Jazzpunk,Same here it's hard to get into other games since I've played rdr2 I keep going back to it.
Jazzpunk,"Yeah, I guess waiting for the new update and dlc is the best option as new things will be added along with overhauls. Thanks for the reply."
Jazzpunk,What kind of depth does rdr2 have?
Jazzpunk,"Yeah. I just saw the dlc as pre-order along with Cyberpunk, but I think it will not be a great idea to buy it as they are adding and overhauling some features of the game in the next update probably. I guess waiting atleast till the update will be the right choice. Thanks for the reply."
Jazzpunk,I’ve just started the game is it best to wait for the DLC then and when does it drop ?
Jazzpunk,Phantom Pain is Metal Gear Solid. Cyberpunk 2077's expansion is called Phantom Liberty.
Jazzpunk,Do you know if ultimate version of RDR2 is worth it?
Jazzpunk,Any other game similar to rdr2 in gameplay? I love the sort of chill vibes with the option of action.
Jazzpunk,Careful it's CP2077
Jazzpunk,"Just a minor note that the outfit issue was fixed with a transmog function, so now you can play dress up and not just worry about stats.  But if you want to see your own outfit you have to drive a motorcycle."
Jazzpunk,Should I finish cyberpunk before the dlc?
Jazzpunk,"Yeah same here, RDR2 was amazing but I was way more immersed in Cyberpunk's world than RDR2's one 

Though both are really great games and should be played imo"
Jazzpunk,"Sorry to bother, but I would also like to ask which edition of RDR2 should I get. I will tell beforehand that I don't think I will be playing online version of the game."
Jazzpunk,I think most people agree that RDR2’s story is great and the strongest part of the game besides the visuals.
Jazzpunk,"Bruh. Who has the audacity to say RDR2 doesn’t have a good story?

It’s been widely, widely lauded as having one of the best stories in recent years"
Jazzpunk,"Thanks. I think story is subjective so might really like RDR2 too as I am not a huge fan of futuristic world. Though I am not a huge fan of Cowboys either (mediaeval fan here), though I might like it if I play it. Thanks for replying, I might get RDR2 now and wait for the update and expansion of Cyberpunk."
Jazzpunk,"I don't know about the story, but the best video game character is BT-7274. Period."
Jazzpunk,"This is how I feel. Cyberpunk was faster paced and I got more immediate gratification. I actually still haven’t gotten very far in RDR2 just because it has been slower-paced, but that being said, it is an exceptionally well-designed game"
Jazzpunk,"You’ve just described my exact experience. I really enjoyed RDR2 but we had just had our first baby when the it released - I just didn’t have the time and it fell by the wayside as a result, so I never finished it. Cyberpunk I managed to complete several times over on PS4 Pro and one more on PS5. Every single play through I’ve played completely differently to the last. It’s been immense. The sheer variety on offer with the story and the play styles means totally different experiences each time. While Red Dead is a beautiful and epic experience - it’s a fairly unilateral one. The only real variety coming from how many side missions or how much peripheral content you want to pursue. My wife played Cyberpunk more than I did - her sessions were vastly different to mine. I haven’t seen anything quite like it since the likes of Elder Scrolls."
Jazzpunk,“HANK! DON’T ABBREVIATE CYBERPUNK LIKE THAT! HAAAAANK!”
Jazzpunk,Not really. Where is the single player content?
Jazzpunk,"Same is experience. RDR2 more polished and you interact with more things, and NPC has better reactions. But cyberpunk is just more fun to play.

My biggest issue with rockstar games is that on rails and very linear. That’s being said they still quality games and will buying the next Rockstar game when it comes out."
Jazzpunk,You can always turn off aim assist for a better challenge in RDR2
Jazzpunk,What do you mean by terrible gameplay in RDR2?
Jazzpunk,"Yeah, just saw the amount of things they are adding in the update and expansion. Some of it is overhaul of current systems so I guess waiting for the update and the dlc is the best thing for now. Anyways, I would like to ask one more thing, should I buy RDR2 on Epic store or Steam because as far as I have heard, Epic store has a really bad mod support for games. And I guess there some fine mods for RDR2 so would like to get my hands on them. Thanks."
Jazzpunk,"> game i *paid* for. So

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*"
Jazzpunk,"I played the game about a year ago and only experienced like 5 bugs, none of them even being close to game breaking"
Jazzpunk,I bought and played a month or so ago and experienced almost 0 bugs. I think one quest messed up and that was it. After the most recent patch it seems pretty good. Also looks amazing with the ray tracing.
Jazzpunk,">the janky controls are super frustrating and honestly it’s pretty slow at times. I don’t need to watch long animations every time I pick something up or do anything. It’s more cowboy sim than game.  
>  
>Tried it 3 times and never make it past 10 hrs or so.

Not every game is made for you."
Jazzpunk,you think cyberpunk is a fail because of first week youtube videos and headlines. mostly everyone that plays the game says it is on track to becoming a no man's sky type revive
Jazzpunk,Cyberpunk absolutely does not have better writing…
Jazzpunk,no reason to skip one of the greatest games of this generation
Jazzpunk,"How is it overrated, there’s no game that has that level of detail, i can understand not enjoying the slow paced gameplay, but you can’t deny that no game has pushed the boundaries of open world like red dead in terms of immersion."
Jazzpunk,sure buddy go play ludo
Jazzpunk,You're getting hate but it's true. RD2 felt more like an interactive movie than a game.
Jazzpunk,"For reference, I have played both and love both, I even lean towards rdr2, but I am recommending based on OP's interests, unlike most of you"

Jazzpunk,I’ll be honest I thought RDR2 was a tedious piece of trash and nothing like the first game. Cyberpunk   Is more fun and you’ll want to play it more.
Jazzpunk,"Cyberpunk is getting a big expansion in September, along with a huge update that overhauls the whole game pretty much. Definitely hit RDR first and then grab cyberpunk after the update sometime."
Jazzpunk,Great story.  Great gameplay.  Great experience overall.
Jazzpunk,"I think it has some serious flaws but most of those flaws are in line with the vision of the game rather than being oversights. Like all the animations and forced walk sections, or the controls not being very arcadey with no jump button. The main flaw that defies this rule is the absurdly on-the-rails quests, which are typical for Rockstar.

All of that being said, it was in many ways a masterwork. Unparalleled attention to detail. Felt great to explore and discover. Could sink absurd hours into it or just pick up and play, and either way is fun. I find myself coming back to it all the time and finding things I missed.

It was imo the first Open World to feature both breadth and depth in world design without being riddled with bugs. You can tell the crunch went into perfecting the details rather than throwing the game together.

Gameplay and story not revolutionary but consistently solid."
Jazzpunk,It’s an absolute masterpiece.
Jazzpunk,"I've played and beaten both, and I love both games. That being said RDR2 is a fucking masterpiece. I don't know any game I'd pick over rdr2 in a one on one."
Jazzpunk,"It's probably the deepest and most fully realized open world ever crafted, filled with rich and compelling characters, emergent choices, and awesome things to discover. It's held up by many experts as one of the iconic examples of video games as art. But go off, chief. Contrarianism is all the rage."
Jazzpunk,"It would be easier to list what components of RDR2 *do not* have depth:

Enemies - it's all pew pew guys across the board.

Mounts - it's all horses across the board.

As for narrative, gameplay, world building, world interaction, customization, side missions, character developments, npc interactions, etc. etc. etc., I could go on but I've given your clearly catty, insincere comment enough effort and time, maybe just become more interesting in the future and open up with a compelling point next time."
Jazzpunk,September 26.
Jazzpunk,Haha very true that was a Freudian slip!
Jazzpunk,"If you can get it cheap then maybe but I don't think it's worth it, personally."
Jazzpunk,Rdr1 is the only one I can think of
Jazzpunk,GTA
Jazzpunk,Death Stranding I suppose both tedious games but are top 3 for me
Jazzpunk,Oh that’s good to know. And thanks for the correction
Jazzpunk,No they plan to overhaul the ai and make other changes. (Better Skill tree for example)
Jazzpunk,"In which case, the cheapest version. The ultimate edition just has online content iirc"
Jazzpunk,"Is the story really good or are the characters just carrying everything? Playing rn and the story is kind of meh. Rockstar games never really had a great main story, but that is not necessary with all the fun.

Not saying I'm right, just how I am feeling right now."
Jazzpunk,[deleted]
Jazzpunk,"Many actually. And even as a huge fan myself, I understand that the pacing of that story is all over the place and many of my friends drop it after initial 2-3 snowy hours and I keep on trying to convince them."
Jazzpunk,"When I was contemplating rdr2 I felt like you. I also was unsure about the horse riding mechanic, as I was used to GTA and using vehicles. And I was unsure I would enjoy the 1899 setting. But let me tell you, get this game! It’s so good. You will end up being fascinated with the world, including the horse riding."
Jazzpunk,"I've tried to get into RDR2 multiple times, I really appreciate the quality and complexity of the game, but I just can't, because I find the entire cowboy setting to be boring and uninteresting."
Jazzpunk,"The game was so good and complete at release, it didn’t need it."
Jazzpunk,"There's a reason why they made auto aim the default in RDR2, because the combat is so clunky that it needs it"
Jazzpunk,It’s a very boring gameplay that’s for sure.
Jazzpunk,Mainly because the mission design and combat are so bad
Jazzpunk,"I play on PS5, so I wouldn't know much about epic store vs steam. Maybe try asking on the Red Dead sub, they will probably give better answers than I could"
Jazzpunk,You can mod pretty much everygame on steam just as well if not better than epic. Some games even have steam cumunity mods through the steam store such as l4d2. Really the only reason id choose epic over steam for anything is if epic is giving a game away for free and even them there are some cases where id still just rather buy it from steam.
Jazzpunk,Good bot
Jazzpunk,The freind i borrowed it from said the same thing so i guess it varied from person to person. My experience was a mess. Nothing game breaking in the sense that i couldn't progress but a lot of religing becouse i got stuck in terminals and uis. Also had this one where jackie always had his gun out no matter what animtion he was doing or where he was. Even had it on that mission where we coukdnt bring our guns. Nothing could have been done to fix that one just had to accept that that was jakie now for that playthrough
Jazzpunk,"Im with this guy, never had any game breaking bugs in this game from day 1. Playing PC with a good gpu over on my end tho. If youve got a 30 series gpu or newer cyberpunk runs literally fine"
Jazzpunk,Yeah thats one thing i can personally attest to it looks really good. Also it supports dlss 3 fram generation so it runs really smooth a 4000 series card.
Jazzpunk,"This is a stupid fucking reply

Nowhere did they say that. They're allowed to criticise the controls of a game when someone asks for opinions on that game. Opinions from both sides are important when deciding whether to buy something or not."
Jazzpunk,Never said it was.
Jazzpunk,It's widely agreed the controls and combat are super clunky.
Jazzpunk,"Opinions are opinions my dude, both games had amazing writing but I felt more connected to Cyberpunk."
Jazzpunk,Guess the opinions are divided. I didn't like rdr2's writing very much. What was so great about it then?
Jazzpunk,I agree about the level of detail. For sure it's impressive in that aspect. It's just soooo fucking slooow man. I almost didn't finish that game considering how tedious it was. I'm sorry.
Jazzpunk,Ok
Jazzpunk,"Tedious as f... imo. I almost didn't finish it, but the story got me through. Gameplay was the worst!"
Jazzpunk,"Weird, I was raised by fast paced shooters and such and absolutely adored rdr2 despite its slower nature."
Jazzpunk,"Want to cook some food? 10 minute animation per piece cooked. Want to loot something? 10 minute animation of you picking the body up. Want to skin an animal? 45 minute animation. Oh, and btw, you need hundreds of pelts if you want to do side content. It is the most ridiculous shit.

Everyone kept telling me I needed to get to chapter 2 to really get a feel for the game. I made it past chapter 2 and I still hate the game. Only now I'm past my refund window and hate it even more now.

Every mission is you riding with some member of your crew on horseback for 45 minutes while you get gigantic exposition dumps. RDR2 is the game you get when you distill the WORST parts of the GTA franchise down into a cowboy game.

This was the first game that was universally praised, in a genre I love, that I hated to it's core. It has me questioning whether or not i should even bother buying the last of us on PC."
Jazzpunk,Where are details on the huge update? Can’t seem to find any but very interested
Jazzpunk,Still playing cyberpunk on a console like ps5 is like playing in a ghost town. If OP has a decent rig he should definitely hit cyberpunk in September.
Jazzpunk,"Wasn't this supposed to come out this month? I am very excited about the DLC, but I'll believe the release date once I've downloaded it."
Jazzpunk,"Will they completely drop their sad excuse for an armor system, their sad excuse for a weapon system, and their sad excuse for a perk system? Oh wait… that’s like every system in the damn game. Would be silly to ask for that.

Edit: holy shit it looks like they are!"
Jazzpunk,"I thought it was very visually impressive and well acted. Also the soundtrack fucking slaps. I love the soundtrack. It also usually managed to capture the intended vibe very well. But it wasn't very thought-provoking. And some of the side content just completely misses the mark. 

Cyberpunk is a lot less polished and pleasant. But some of the sidequests could have carried entire high-quality indiegames."
Jazzpunk,"Trailing missions, long ass point a to point b travel, goofy ah shooting, extremely linear missions, breaking the games economy with that stage coach robbery mission. Can’t deny the flaws."
Jazzpunk,Did not know a simple question was a clearly catty insincere comment....
Jazzpunk,"Lol what a pathetically insecure reply. RDR2 has absolutely zero depth when it comes to gameplay, mission structure, level design, or npc interactions. It’s all shallow set dressing for a pretty decent story that would’ve worked better as a TV series. As an actual videogame, it’s average at best."
Jazzpunk,"> I've given your clearly catty, insincere comment enough effort and time, maybe just become more interesting in the future and open up with a compelling point next time.

You’re right - how dare he ask a simple question about your favourite game?! The audacity of /u/ihave0idea0 knows no limits! 

Personally I find RDR2 wholly unappealing to me, mostly because what I’ve seen of the combat mechanics seems quite repetitive and more importantly not skill-based.  
But I also don’t like the Elder Scrolls series or Cyberpunk for the same reason, so this thread just isn’t for me."
Jazzpunk,"Yeah, been through that. And online doesn't do it for me"
Jazzpunk,I actually have that. Might give it a try
Jazzpunk,Oh I’ll wait then damn okay thanks.
Jazzpunk,Thank you very much.
Jazzpunk,"It’s definitely more character driven than plot driven. It might take a while for the story to get going, but when it does, it’s really some of the best dramatic writing I’ve ever seen in anything. It’s worth sticking with for sure."
Jazzpunk,"… that’s what a story is, a journey of characters through an arc. The plot of 99% of stories is the same basic shit."
Jazzpunk,"Fair, I can’t seem to get into Witcher 3, despite being a huge fan of the lore and gameplay.

It just… feels so huge and cumbersome"
Jazzpunk,Yeah the story feels very disjointed. You do like 5 completely unrelated main story missions and then eventually come across another mission that advances the story. How’s that a great story? I get that people like those unrelated main missions since they like long games and are willing to tolerate a somewhat disjointed story if it means a longer game. But you can’t tell me that’s a good story. A good story must have a good flow.
Jazzpunk,Rdr2 is easily top 5 of last gen
Jazzpunk,"Yeah it's not even gameplay.
Just high quality movie"
Jazzpunk,Tried that but didn't get any answer. Other modding subreddits had no idea either. I guess I will try asking there again. Thank you very much.
Jazzpunk,"Actually had a coupon on epic store, so wouldn't want it to go to waste. I have some other the list but would live to know if epic store version can be modded. The RDR2 subreddit seems kinda dead with most of the posts with no replies so I think I might not get one there either."
Jazzpunk,Best bot
Jazzpunk,">This is a stupid fucking reply

Exactly my thoughts lol.

I absolutely loved RDR2 but I can totally see how it can be boring for some people. In fact, I've seen plenty of comments on various subs saying exactly that, so I think it's important thing to highlight for OP."
Jazzpunk,"It was cool at first but then I just got tired of it quick. I also work 50hrs a week with like 1 hour commute one way so I just don’t have time for slow games anymore. 
That being said getting off a horse just to pick something up every time is just an awful game play design."
Jazzpunk,What a debby downer you are. Pessimistic much? Lol
Jazzpunk,Valid
Jazzpunk,"[Check it](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/147domj/everything_new_with_phantom_liberty_and_patch_17/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)

I’m pretty excited"
Jazzpunk,It says September 26th on steam. Even if you don't get the DLC you still get access to the massive overhaul btw.
Jazzpunk,I think the side content is amazing. Maybe some things could be better but it is very good
Jazzpunk,"Yeah I get that but thought provoking is not what I expect from Rockstar, or any game outside of select RPGs.

It’s more like a great execution of a tried and true formula. If I wanted a thought provoking Western, I’d reread Blood Meridian, not play an open world game."
Jazzpunk,There’s nothing thought provoking about Cyperpunk either
Jazzpunk,They’re not flaws…  They’re features!
Jazzpunk,Yeah rockstar hasn't improved it's gameplay since GTA San Andreas. It's a shame because visually and story wise the games are brilliant
Jazzpunk,"It's not a simple question, it's probably the most highly praised game of the last decade, pretending that you know nothing about it whatsoever and have decided to randomly come to me to learn more about it is naive and stupid at best."
Jazzpunk,"And this is the kind of dumbass mentality that went behind asking 'hurr, what kind of depth rdr2 got?'"
Jazzpunk,"The OP asked which game should he play, not your emotional personal take that doesn’t help at all and literally NO ONE cares about"
Jazzpunk,I hear you. Just the most similar gameplay I could think of. Basically the same game at a different time period with different technology.
Jazzpunk,"Story wise, propably. Gameplay, definetly not."
Jazzpunk,I dont see why not you wouldnt be able too. Modding alters your local files on your system so i feel like whichever store front you bought it from wouldnt matter. All the games ive ever modded were on steam but i never had to actually interact with steam to do it so i feel like the same processes would have worked even if i bought them from epic.
Jazzpunk,"Fair enough, that horse thing is true"
Jazzpunk,"Everyone I know loves this game. So I never criticize it around them, because I would feel like a debbie downer. It was just exciting to finally see someone else hate it."
Jazzpunk,Everything he said is valid and he’s entitled to his opinion. That isn’t pessimism
Jazzpunk,"The shredder of panda guy I’m replying to blocked  me, then reported me to Reddit for some kinda wellness check?? People are so weird.. wtf"
Jazzpunk,"Thank you. 

Man I am hype now."
Jazzpunk,I'm happy for you. That I didn't feel the same doesn't mean I want to take that away from you
Jazzpunk,"I don't think thought provoking was something they were not trying to do. The story of the main characters in what is essentially a cult was compelling but just not for that long. 

Also looking at cyberpunk again. I think there are plenty of moments there that could be labeled thought provoking. 

Maybe I just wanted the wrong things from the game."
Jazzpunk,"No? What about Joshua's quest line? Rivers quest line? The quests with the mayor and his wife? V's story, the different endings. Even the quest with the vending machine ends up asking some interesting questions."
Jazzpunk,Let’s hope for gta 6 I personally didn’t like rdr2 as much as other people did for personal reasons but I still thought it was a fantastic game
Jazzpunk,"Damn, you even double-downed on it.

People ARE allowed to not know everything about RDR2, man.

You clearly spend a lot of time thinking about your favourite video games - that’s fine, but you should realise that other people may have other interests and may actually not know much about it, if at all.

As I said I personally find the gameplay uninteresting (not sure how you can think it has a lot of depth, tbh) - and a game without good gameplay is just a bad game to me. Therefore I have little interest in Rockstar games in general, because their gameplay is usually super casual-oriented.

As for the rest of you description of the depth of the game, you used a bunch of buzz-words but didn’t actually explaining anything to the guy.

Good graphics, good story, world building, character development and voice acting are great, but if that’s all there is to it, I’d rather watch a movie or read a book tbh. Gameplay is where games are at for me, and a lot of people in general."
Jazzpunk,"Did you mean to reply to someone else?

How am I the emotional one for replying to someone having a complete meltdown at the mère idea that someone didn’t know the alleged qualities of RDR2?

I explained why I thought that neither games thought of by OP were particularly good in my opinion. That’s very relevant to the discussion.

What’s the point of your needlessly aggressive comment that no one asked for and no one cares about, to use your own words?"
Jazzpunk,Exactly. However I think my emotional investment was larger in rdr2. But time period doesn't really matter.
Jazzpunk,"Thanks for the reply. Just wanted to make sure. Actually, I heard and experienced issues with modding, especially with Bethesda games in Epic Games Store. And in general have heard people saying that Epic store is pretty bad if someone wants to play with mods. Modding for me is one of the main and most fun things (especially in games like Skyrim) so sometimes no excess to mods can be a huge deal breaker for me."
Jazzpunk,"""10 minute animation. 45 minute animation"". Yeah sure  that's real valid isn't it lol. Someone being overly negative and blowing something out of proportion is considered to be pessimistic to me. I never said he was wrong and couldn't have an opinion. I just called him a debby downer. I'm entitled to my opinion as well right?"
Jazzpunk,"Hey, what didn’t you like about the side content? I guess hunting is kinda barebones"
Jazzpunk,"Rivers quest was so boring. Go here, fetch this. Fetch that. Search the nephews room for clues. Snooze fest. It was nothing I haven’t seen before a million times. Most of the side quests were boring as hell. There were some cool moments, but thought provoking? Nah."
Jazzpunk,"Don't care, didn't read; get more interesting and stop leaning on sarcasm as a crutch for your lack of personality."
Jazzpunk,Continue with your non contributions. Op asked which game and here you are just wasting thread space
Jazzpunk,If you want to rant about how terrible RDR2 is make your own post
Jazzpunk,"Your making comments on someone’s character over a game, if anything you’re a Debby downer"
Jazzpunk,"Some of the sidequests were kinda stupid and unsatisfying. The one that stuck in my mind the most was the one where you encounter that woman who takes advantage of two guys with disabilities and the ark of the story is that the guys don't want to be with her because she's an absolutely horrible, abusive human being. Then when you find them they realise that they're still gonna go with her. 

Like what's the point? I had no input, the ark of the characters was to learn to put up with an abuser and it took like 20 minutes. 

&#x200B;

Not to say that I encountered no good sidequests. The one where you help a woman learn to live in the forest was lovely. But the game to me was littered with moments that ended in an unsatisfying anticlimax."
Jazzpunk,"Very interesting. What did you think of >!
Jackies funeral? !<"
Jazzpunk,"That comes from the guy that screeched and had a complete meltdown when someone else dared ask which kind of depth RDR2 had, because how dare he not know your favourite video game.

There is 0 irony in my last comment, btw! Not that I would expect you to understand irony…

Lmfao, reddit basement-dweller moment."
Jazzpunk,"What’s YOUR contribution, lad? What’s your purpose? Why are you commenting?

As I said above, I explained why I thought neither of the games were particularly good in my opinion. That’s highly relèvent on a sub where people ask whether they should buy specific games.

My comment is on topic. Yours aren’t and are just useless attacks with 0 contribution on the actual subject. Are you perhaps an alt of the other guy? That’s the o my way this would make sense, tbh. You’re weird"
Jazzpunk,"Ranting? For a whole 2 lines? Do you even know what a rant is? Open a dictionary ffs

The guy above had a meltdown when someone asked a simple question, I pointed out to him that no everyone necessarily liked every game or knew everything about every game.

That’s highly relevant to the conversation.

Once again, what is YOUR contribution here, apart from attacking me for no reason?"
Jazzpunk,You're making comments about my character over a reddit post. A bit hypocritical.
Jazzpunk,"Well, I didn't realize they had disabilities. Maybe I'm just stupid. I'm guessing your talking about the one where you had to keep punching and kicking those guys to prove which one was stronger? 

I saw it as funny, and I never saw them go back to her, I don't think I ever saw them after their final mission.  


Maybe I just didn't find them or I'm stupid. Oh well, I enjoyed those missions, and yeah that one with charlotte (woman in forest) was great."
Jazzpunk,Getting his bike was the best part
Jazzpunk,"No, you were in fact, weird because no one cares what you don’t like. I was genuinely interested in seeing how much people loved one game over the other but here you are."
Jazzpunk,I already gave my contribution
Jazzpunk,"My contribution was that I love both games but I feel like RDR two gets the one here because not only is it one of the greatest games of all time, but the story is pretty impactful"
Jazzpunk,My context might seem illiterate because I am using voice to text
Jazzpunk,"I think we're talking about another quest.  I googled it, it's called ""the smell of grease paint""."
Jazzpunk,"Intruiging. I absolutely love that quest for how real it feels. 
>! How it takes the time to mourn and speak to the people that this affected. Presenting a death so realistically gave so much validity to the rest of the world. It made me remember times I've lost people. 
Death in video games is never presented like this. !<"
Jazzpunk,"That sounds like a you issue, tbh

- Some people love one game more than the other

- some people prefer the other one

- some people like neither of them

These are all valid opinions on the exact same subject. I’m in the third camp, for reasons that I explained. I would therefore recommend OP to buy neither of these games if the reasons I gave resonate with him.

It’s hilarious that you don’t see that my comment is very much on topic for this thread - logic isn’t your forte, huh"
Jazzpunk,"Clearly not in this chain of comment, which is why I’m asking you what you’re even doing here."
Jazzpunk,"Fair enough! That’s understandable.

My contribution was that I didn’t like either of them for the reason stated above (gameplay isn’t interesting or skill-based enough, and that’s what matters most in games in my opinion), and therefore wouldn’t recommend either of them.

Don’t you see how my opinion is just as valid as yours? Again, why are you commenting here?"
Darkwood,"[https://store.steampowered.com/app/274520/Darkwood/#app\_reviews\_hash](https://store.steampowered.com/app/274520/Darkwood/#app_reviews_hash)

&#x200B;

yup."
Darkwood,Nope.
FTL: Faster Than Light,"Can't really compare to FTL because there's no strategy here, only fast Dogfight.
If you're looking for good arcade dogfight (Freelancer or Galaxy on Fire style) then I highly recommended it.

Exploration is mostly fly to the node then mining or opening containers for craft resource, credits and sometimes gears or crafting recipe.

It's repetition hit quite fast because each section doesn't have many 'unique' things going on and a couple of playthrough means you see it all.

Still, you could pretend each run is grinding for money like other open-space sim game. Dying means lose everything but recipe and credits to upgrade your ship.

Can't speak for DLC but it seems to add 'unique', quest during exploration and a bit of lore, which might fix the problem above."
Firewatch,"Honestly, I'd say wait for a better sale. I bought i on pc (gog) for 5 € and the game was worth that. It's a good game with some very nice features and moments but to me the game wasn't perfect and worth a 20 € price (especially for you and your family covid situation)."
Firewatch,"I actually just finished my first playthrough two days ago.  It's a lovely game.  There's no doubt about that.  That being said, runtime is short (like 3.5-4.5 hours) and there isn't much reason to replay, even though there are choices that give the story extra flavor (but don't change it all too much.)  There's also the ability to free roam the map, which is nice given the scope of the world and how beautiful the game is.  There's also a dev commentary mode, which tempts a second playthrough from me.

That being said, I can't recommend it if the price tag makes too big of a weight in your wallet.  You already know what the story is, and it really isn't a game you can go back to multiple times.  Maybe wait for a sale, it doesn't seem to go on sale often on Switch, but it was $5.99 on the US eShop in mid-June, where it's definitely worth the price."
Blasphemous,Hollow knight
Blasphemous,"Id say Hollow or Stardew over Blasphemous. That's a great game too but Hollow Knight does what it does better, and Stardew is a very chill game"
Blasphemous,"I liked both but HK is so superior to every other game in the genre that it's unfair to compair to other games. 

For that reason alone, I would take advantage that you haven't played it and play Blasphemous first. Otherwise it will definitely feel like a downgrade. And not because is bad, it's just that HK does everything better. 

If it's a ""I can only afford one"" kinda thing, just go for HK. 

Stardew Valley is a different genre entirely."
Blasphemous,"Hollow knight is the better game objectively, but IMO I'd go with Blasphemous - I just dig the style and design."
Blasphemous,HK. Better in everyway and has way more content. Blasphemous is still very good as well.
Super Hexagon,"Never played Paper Mario, but if there's something I'm already tired of hearing about the new one is that it's a incredibly well written game and extremely funny. I also heard that it's not comparable to the Paper Mario on the 64, though, so beware of this. I know it doesn't have an RPG structure anymore, and that it also has a combat system that most people doesn't seem to enjoy much, acting much more as a puzzle game in many ways. It seems really fun to me, though.

I honestly don't think I've ever laughed in Odyssey, but I definitely felt amazed in many, many moments, with one in specific making my jaw drop, as I would never expect such an epic thing in a Mario game. Odyssey is also a huge game with a fantastic gameplay and fluid movement. It's perfect for people who love to get a bunch of collectibles doing different challenges and puzzles, and also incredible to explore and discover new things to do and places to visit. I can definitely guarantee you that it's a game with much more playtime and content than Origami King, cause It's really big (I have already 100 hours in it, to give you an idea, and still have some stuff to do).

As someone who loves Mario Galaxy with passion and always said that Mario 64 is the best 3D Mario of all time, Odyssey managed to become the number 1 now.

Sorry for any mistakes... English isn't my native language... And feel free to ask anything you want! I'll gladly answer back!"
Super Hexagon,"Origami King is a charming game that's genuinely funny at times. Actually playing it becomes a bit of a chore through the battle system though. 

Odyssey isn't really funny, but it's charming as all hell and is just a delight running from world to world and possessing everyone your see. It's the kind of game that makes you happy to play, and is fun from beginning to end.  You should be picking up Odyssey every day of the wee"
Super Hexagon,"Origami king was a lot of fun and is just as funny as color splash, imo. But, odyssey is a switch standard that everyone should get. You'll enjoy either game, though I might have enjoyed origami king a little more myself because of how well written it was. I think the right answer to this question is get both, just pickup the 2nd when you can afford it. As for which to play first- origami king if you want a laugh, odyssey if you want a really good platformer/3d Mario game."
Super Hexagon,haven’t played paper mario but id be very surprised if the answer wouldn’t be to get odyssey
Super Hexagon,I took your advice and bought Odyssey. I’m waiting for it to update. Very excited.
Super Hexagon,I got Odyssey. I’m waiting for it to update. Thanks for the help.
Super Hexagon,I got Odyssey. Thanks for the help!
Super Hexagon,Yes. Even the guy at Game Stop told me to get Odyssey when I asked. So thanks for the help! I’m excited to play it.
Super Hexagon,You're in for a treat! Enjoy! It's a really special game!
Starbound,Factorio is probably the better game
Starbound,"I enjoyed factorio way more than I enjoyed Starbound.

However with the cues you are providing us, it really looks like Starbound is a better fit for you.

Think about factorio more like a ""puzzle"" or even a ""citybuilder"" than an rpg or an exploration game."
Starbound,"I've played Starbound and thought it very similar to Terraria. I enjoyed both! Starbound is prettier, while Terraria has a larger and more active modding community :)"
Death's Door,"This comment has been automatically added because the term Civ 6 was in your title.  

In 2018 there was a scandal known as the Red Shell scandal, wherein a number of game publishers included spyware in their games without the knowledge or consent of their users. Following this there was a consumer backlash, which then caught the attention of the media, putting pressure on these companies to act.  

Now some of the publishers in question have admittedly removed the spyware from their game (though definitely not all), however the EULAs of these games still contain wording that allows them to put Red Shell or any other piece of spyware on your computer without informing you. As this information could potentially sway people's decision as to whether or not they should support companies that would do this, we feel it important to inform when one of these games is mentioned here.  

[Here](https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33039675-Red-Shell-Games/) is a link to a Steam curator who has gathered a list of Steam games that have contained, or currently do contain Red Shell (note that it's not complete, for instance it's missing the Total War series).

Death's Door,"Even though the selection is pretty varied, the clear winner here is Death’s Door. It’s supremely good. The music, the visuals, the world… it all just works."
Limbo,RDR2 is an absolute triumph. It MUST be played.
Limbo,"I would generally recommend RDR2, which is one of the best games ever made.

Presentation is absolutely stunning across the board. Graphics, SFX, music, voice acting, all are absolutely stellar.

Gameplay-wise is also phenomenal. Essentially, to summarise, it plays as a 3rd-person shooter, with some RPG and simulation elements - it really shines in making you *feel* like the character you're playing as, that is, a cowboy in the late 19th/early 20th century, with all the gambling, outlawing, hunting, etc.

The content available is frankly some of the best value in any videogame. This is the most well-realised open-world game ever, in my estimation - an immersive world that feels natural and alive, that exists independently of you but reacts to your decisions. The story is fully fleshed out, dramatic, personal and intimate, but also self-aware enough to shine all the wild west tropes through. You have further an entire online mode that I haven't even touched yet.

When considering the preferences you laid out, I'm even more convinced you'll enjoy it. I'd recommend it over cyberpunk to anyone, but even more to someone with your preferences."
Limbo,"RDR2 is probably the better made game but I also loved Cyberpunk, it’s story, and it felt very creative and new. I liked someone else’s idea of doing RDR2 and buy Cyberpunk when DLC comes out so you can transition straight to DLC"
Limbo,"Love both, but I’d start with RDR2 buddy. And just know, it’ll be awhile before you start Cyberpunk once you get immersed into that work and Aruthur"
Limbo,U can miss cyberpunk. U cant pass on RDR2! Easy as that
Limbo,"Rdr2 without a doubt. The most beautiful open world, lots of chill out time, lots of random and very well written scripted quests, a sense of history with a bit of the absurd, and a tragic crime family story. It will give you a thrill, make you feel like a badass, and then leave you in tears."
Limbo,"I’m sure there will be a Complete Edition for Cyberpunk/Phantom Liberty, so wait on that. Cyberpunk was great; loved the story, Night City and the RPG elements. Granted I played on PS5 when that version was released. 

Red Dead Redemption II is one of the greatest games ever made. Five years later and it’s still worth full price. The quantity and quality of content is impressive."
Limbo,RDR2
Limbo,"As someone that was super hyped cyberpunk and hit it day 1, as faulty and buggy as it was at the time on my ps4, I enjoyed it, and now 100 times better with the next gen update and all on my ps5, that being said, RDR2 was one of the best games of the last generation, and it plays great on next gen consoles… definitely recommend RDR2, it’s not an rpg but getting lost in that world and along with the things you discover in it are very rpg like to me, definitely recommend RDR2"
Limbo,"RDR2.

Cyberpunk is cool, but it will be much cooler in a few months with the update/remake

I also would only get cyberpunk if you have at least a PS5/next gen/pc"
Limbo,Red dead redemption until cyberpunk dlc is released
Limbo,"No question, RDR2 all the way!"
Limbo,"I feel like RDR2 is a much better overall game, but is more divisive than you would be lead to believe. It's a slow burn story game, so if you're cool with that, it's way better.

Cyberpunk is exactly as you expect it to look and feel."
Limbo,"Cyberpunk base game is also been a lot of improvements when the DLC releases so get cyberpunk then with the DLC, for now its time for RDR2 Boah!!"
Limbo,RDR2
Limbo,RDR2 without a doubt
Limbo,"Red dead, even though I mostly play rpgs. Even though it’s fairly polished now I just find Cyberpunk to be boring. Idk I hope someday I can engage with it but it’s not now."
Limbo,"RDR2

Cyberpunk is also a very good game, and I do recommend you play it eventually

But with the DLC just around the corner (only three months away in fact) you should wait until it releases before getting it"
Limbo,"Wait for the DLC and play RDR2 while you wait. I personally liked Cyberpunk more, but RDR2 is amazing aswell."
Limbo,"Rdr2 and I liked both of them, but RDR2 is on another level"
Limbo,Rdr2
Limbo,"RDR2 is the most polished game I have ever played. The environments are highly-interactive and the world with it’s animals and people respond to you and each other in a very believable way. It’s story is an engaging epic action-drama grounded in reality. It’s extremely immersive.

CP2077 had very rough beginnings and, when I last played it late last year, that roughness still shows through on what otherwise feels like quite a nice game. Everyone knows about the bugs, so there’s no point mentioning them more here.  The physical environments and sound design are very well set up. But the NPCs populating the world will behave in ways that might break your immersion. When a gun is fired, they will all crouch in the same animation and despawn as soon as you aren’t looking. Police will spawn in on top of you when you commit a crime and don’t put up any chase when you flee. Feels disappointing in a world constructed around the notion of constant police-gang struggle. Supposedly this is slated to be reworked in the future.
The world has some interactivity more on par with games like dishonored 2. Dialogue feels particularly strong and the story is, in my experience, engaging. 
One strange thing is the character customisation. One premise of the world building is ‘fashion over function’. How you look is supposedly as important as how you act on the world of 2077. But this is totally at odds with the actual game mechanics. You will be heavily encouraged to wear clothes for their stats, not their appearance, and that will lead to some pretty weird costume combos. It doesn’t matter much because the game is entirely first person perspective, but that begs the (controversial?) question of why have a player model at all."
Limbo,Yes red dead redemption is much better on many levels right off the bat.
Limbo,Rdr2
Limbo,"Rdr2 100%. In my opinion it’s the best/most realistic video game ever made. The only downside is it’s ruined every game I’ve played after it. Either the graphics look terrible, the story is dumb, gaming mechanics aren’t as good etc.."
Limbo,"Hands down, RDR2. While I enjoyed Cyberpunk for what it is, I don't think that's a close call by almost any metric."
Limbo,"Red Dead Redemption 2 by far; I 100% Cyberpunk 2077, I did not 100% Red Dead.  Cyberpunk doesn't not have a lot of depth, unfortunately, its presentation is good and certainly has gotten better since launch but literally the only time I would even talk about it in the same breath as RDR2 is a question like yours, in terms of quality and depth and content, it doesn't hold a candle to RDR2.

There is of course a difference in setting to consider, but just keep in mind that while the 'cyberpunk' aesthetic is certainly present in Cyberpunk 2077, I'd argue it doesn't even do it as well as games like Shadowrun for SNES or Shadowrun for Genesis.  That may seem harsh, but again I did everything you could do in this game, it really doesn't have much going for it."
Limbo,RDR2
Limbo,"I would wait for the the dlc for Cyberpunk as it seems it will be some kind of mega side quest and will bring improvements to the base game as well, rdr2 is hit or miss I guess depending on people, it's a slow paced game but amazing visuals, story and immersion but with that said I finished cyberpunk and still will come back for the dlc, the game has a pretty big replayability if you like trying different approach to combat"
Limbo,"If you don't mind a slow burn for massive payoff then go for RDR2. You'll want to wait to play CP2077 until Phantom Liberty releases as they're doing an overhaul of the base game too.

Edit: Liberty not Pain"
Limbo,RDR2
Limbo,"No, it's not Next-Gen Optimized, but still RDR2 all day every day"
Limbo,"RDR2 is the superior game in my opinion. Cyberpunk is pretty bland in comparison. However, Cyberpunk has better performance in that, it can run at 60 fps on next- gen consoles (whereas RDR2 is locked at 30 fps) and is better optimized on PC, though still expect bugs. Also, RDR2 can be overwhelming with its size and detail, Cyberpunk is much smaller in scale."
Limbo,RDR 2 if you like a beautiful masterpiece
Limbo,"I just started RD2 on PC about a week ago and it’s absolutely sensational.

I do plan on getting CP after the new DLC comes out tho, and after I finish the main story in RD2!"
Limbo,You like computers or cowboys?
Limbo,"Seems like they’re going to add lots of fixes to the new gen consoles version of cyberpunk along with the expansion, so I think you should play RDR2 until a much better version of cyberpunk is out."
Limbo,RDR2.
Limbo,Red Dead Redemption 2
Limbo,"Wait for the Dlc of Cyberpunk, the game will get a massive overhaul with it"

Limbo,Red Dead 2
Limbo,RDR2 duh. CP2077 world and setting is unlike anything I've seen before so that's why I liked it but the story and gameplay was just ok to me.
Limbo,"RD2 

Wait for cyberpunks expansion and then get it. It’s a good game on its own. Think Skyrim but in a cyberpunk setting. Yes is failed on some major systems they were supposed to have. Supposedly they are reworking a ton which will drop with the new expansion in September"
Limbo,Red Dead. Definitely Red Dead.
Limbo,RDR 2 hands down!
Limbo,rdr2 for sure!
Limbo,Rdr2
Limbo,"I might get some hate, but i enjoyed cyberpunk way more than i did rdr2. Maybe rdr2 was too tedious for me, or i didnt like the setting so much. Not sure, still a masterpiece though. 
Still id get cp2077"
Limbo,Red Dead Redemption 2
Limbo,RDR2. By a mile!
Limbo,"There has recently (as in, this weekend) been an article about the Cyberpunk DLC. Along side it is an overall of almost every system. The state its in now, Cyberpunk is *fine.* The open world feels so dead and empty, with nothing ever changing. You can stand and watch a NPC for 5 hours, and they will not move from there spot. The gunplay is fantastic, and the story is good, although that's of course subjective) I think part of that will be changing, along with the many other little tweaks they will be making, along side adding the DLC. So I would hold off. 

&#x200B;

RDR2, in contrast is amazing. The story, combat, graphics are wonderful and I don't have much bad to say about the game. My only complaint is the pacing of the story. It drags on a little to much, but at the same time, that's kind of the point? So It seems a weird complaint. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, TL;DR- Buy RDR2, Hold of on Cyberpunk until the DLC is released"
Limbo,Red dead 2. That game is forever in my heart
Limbo,"If you like RPG games, go for cyberpunk. But if you want an experience go for RDR2. Many people say that rdr2 doesn’t have a good story, but I believe that it is amazing. But I think everyone will agree that rdr2 has the best protagonist of all time, Arthur Morgan."
Limbo,[deleted]
Limbo,"It took me almost 70h to complete the main story in RDR2 that is without any side missions or free roaming.

Done the cyberpunk main story a lot of side quests and done some free roaming all under 50h"
Limbo,Both are great but I'd wait for Cyberpunk fixes and qol that come with the expansion so RDR2 first
Limbo,"RDR2 is probably the better made game but I also loved Cyberpunk, it’s story, and it felt very creative and new. I liked someone else’s idea of doing RDR2 and buy Cyberpunk when DLC comes out so you can transition straight to DLC"
Limbo,"I completed cyberpunk 3x with lowered graphics and shit fps. (Roll on phantom liberty with a 3080)

I didnt finish RDR2s first? Second? Act.

Dont get me wrong, I think RDR2 is an amazing game, probably the better one, but these are the facts lol."
Limbo,Rdr2.  Then In September you can get CP when it gets somewhat overhauled by developers
Limbo,Why is that even a question? RDR2 should be the default answer to this.
Limbo,Get both honestly. They are both masterpieces of games. I personally enjoy Cyberpunk a lot more but they are both fantastic in terms of story and gameplay.
Limbo,Cp 2077
Limbo,"I'd go with RDR2 first and, depending on how much free time you have, by the time you're done with it there'll probably be some version of Cyberpunk with Phantom Liberty included. Either way you'll have a great time with both, enjoy!"
Limbo,"I admit that rdr2 is the better made game,  I just got bored by it.  Cyberpunk was way more fun and engaging to me. I played on a pretty good pc, and didn't really have any expectations going into the game,  so I wasn't soured by anything.

Rockstar games kinda just bore me tbh. After playing the ps2 gta games to death,  any Rockstar game after just feels like it plays the exact same."
Limbo,I love Cyberpunk and never had bug issues. You should 100% get red dead as it’s probably the best game ever created.
Limbo,Red Dead Redemption 2 is already a complete game. Cyberpunk still needs polishing and should be even more solid after the expansion comes out in September. RDR2 will hold you until then.
Limbo,"if u have a series console, ps5, or high end pc, get cyberpunk for 30$ plus the expansion for another 30$. if u don't have that, then id say RDR2"
Limbo,"Have both and played both.  
RDR2 is super immersive and so finely tuned - but it is an open world Rockstar game so it's going to be a bit overwhelming, at least it was to me.  
Cyberpunk is also open world but a bit more linear.  It has that Skyrim like maneuverability where things can get wonky but it allows the player more freedom. 

I'd say go for cyberpunk and just play it now so you have an understanding of the game and story before the dlc comes out."
Limbo,"I have both.

Cyberpunk is more of RPG style than RDR2. There's skill points and such to distribute. RDR2 increases stats for you based on what you do.

Cyberpunk's AI have health bars, red dead's doesn't. It's more immersive for that reason.

RDR2 is much slower pace, but has a lot more to explore. The scenery can be breath-taking and sometimes hard to fathom how good it looks. 

Cyberpunk has a lot of nothing, but it still looks pretty cool. Nice graphics.

So far, I like cyberpunk's story but it can seem a bit all over the place.

RDR2 has been easier to follow."
Limbo,"If you just want a decent story with an immersive world and nice graphics, RDR2 is fine for that. It has pretty terrible gameplay, and it's a brain-dead easy game that treats players like they have 60 IQ. If you just want to turn off your brain for 60-hours and play through a decent story, then it fits the bill. Especially if you like the wild west and spaghetti western movies, then you will probably like RDR2. 

Cyberpunk has way better art direction than RDR2, but the game is severely lacking in terms of a lot of its open world systems. It has nowhere near as immersive of an open world as RDR2. The setting and visuals are a lot cooler, but the actual execution isn't there. The combat is not very good, but it's at least better than RDR2 in this area. It also has RPG systems and build variety which RDR2 doesn't have. Overall I'd say just wait until the DLC drops, because apparently they have reworked a lot of aspects of the game. CP2077 really does have a lot of potential, so if the DLC lives up to the hype, then it could be a game changer."
Limbo,I just tried cyberpunk a couple weeks ago off a freinds familyshare and its still super buggy to the point where i wound up getting fed up with the bugs and uninstalling. I would have felt very cheated if it was a game i payed for. So i would go with RDR2
Limbo,"Everyone says RDR2 is the best game ever, but the janky controls are super frustrating and honestly it’s pretty slow at times. I don’t need to watch long animations every time I pick something up or do anything. It’s more cowboy sim than game. 

Tried it 3 times and never make it past 10 hrs or so."
Limbo,[deleted]
Limbo,Both
Limbo,Mount a blade bannerlord has great rpg mechanics you can literally be anything in that world
Limbo,I would only choose Cyberpunk solely because it has next gen support. RDR2 is a fantastic game but lacks that kind of support which makes me personally not touch it ever since I beat it back in 2018.
Limbo,"RDR2. It’s a much more immersive game and story. Cyberpunk is a great game too, but I don’t find the story as good at all. The pros about cyberpunk are extreme weapon customization and playstyle customization with perk trees. When I play RDR2 I feel like I’m in the story, and when I play Cyberpunk I feel like I’m in a gigantic beautiful sandbox game."
Limbo,Cyberpunk
Limbo,"RDR2 is much more story rich and interactive compared to cyberpunk. It only takes around 30 hours to complete the main mission, spoiler alert ( when doing the last mission after doing so you get back to prior of starting the last mission to finish anything else to basically you don't fully finish it). It has nice features, ray tracing, and a nice environment, but RDR2 beats it in every other way. That's from my opinion as i have both and played both for 100 hours plus on each."
Limbo,"Cyberpunk has better writing and combat. Rdr2's world is more detailed, alive and polished. 
I prefer cyberpunk.
Most people seem to prefer rdr2."
Limbo,"RDR2. Ive played both and Cyberpunk really lacks in a lot of areas and i didn’t get much enjoyment from it after completing the main story line. RDR2 however is a game that ive replayed numerous times and spent upwards of 400 hours combined playing, most of it in free roam. Havent even touched the online yet."
Limbo,"Cyberpunk's DLC will remain as a DLC, it seems to be set in a new city, but at this point, nothing can be done about the game's dullness and how unfun it is to play. I played it for 25 hours(right until the 3-race side mission were unlocked), and it's just boring, the plot is mediocre, the fighting, the gameplay are subpar, the only redeeming thing was how beautiful everything looked, and that's it"
Limbo,I would be cautious with RDR2 on PC. I had to get a refund on it due to the game constantly crashing; the issues had to do specifically with the Rockstar games launcher which you are required to use.
Limbo,"Rdr2 is a bit of an ancient game in terms of design. Missions force you to do things one way and if you don’t listen the game fails you. It’s also an aggressively easy game that just feels stiff and clunky mechanics wise. It’s got great voice acting, but I found the world and story pretty dull. Cyberpunk is a far more enjoyable game that gives you choices on how to handle each mission with much better combat and a much more interesting world to explore and a far more interesting story."
Limbo,"This is a hard one, gotta do both haha"
Limbo,neither buy rain world 😈😈
Limbo,RDR2 no contest
Limbo,"Depends, if you're on console I would skip RDR2, it still runs at 30FPS, rockstar doesn't care about next gen update."
Limbo,"Neither, buy doom eternal"
Limbo,I dont like rdr2 at all and like project red games
Limbo,Cyberpunk. Red dead 2 is overrated imo
Limbo,They’re both great go with what interests you more.
Limbo,I've played both and I have some stronger critiques on RD2 than most but would still pick it over CP.
Limbo,"Both games are amazing, i loved Cyberpunk it's story characters, scenery. currently playing RDR2 its really good, both games are great. I'd buy both if i were u"
Limbo,Robots and guns or cowboys and guns
Limbo,"I’d go for Cyberpunk personally. The game is really good as long as you take your time and do the side quests. There are a ton of really compelling stories that get told. I’d wait to play until Phantom Liberty releases though. The gameplay is already good, but it’s rumored they’re going to be shipping big improvements to key systems like the AI and the police systems (and possibly more) with the DLC."
Limbo,I recommend getting both
Limbo,"Both are incredible story games, depends on what you want. If you care about story and characters, go red dead, if you care about combat and replay ability go cyberpunk"
Limbo,"Rdr2, 100000%"
Limbo,Cyberpunk if you want action. Red dead if you don't mind watching a movie in game format.
Limbo,Rdr2 cyberpunk has a lot of problems
Limbo,RDR2
Limbo,Red dead partner!
Limbo,Red Dead is the better game hands down.
Limbo,RDR2
Limbo,Do you want to be a cowboy? If so…follow your heart
Limbo,Cyberpunk has a big DLC coming soon.
Limbo,"With the Phantom Liberty expansion, which overhaul all of cyberpunk. It will great to buy...


But RDR2 is a moderm masterpiece so it gets my vote"
Limbo,"Cyberpunk is more action and adrenaline, Red Dead Redemption 2 is more laid back and slow-paced.  


Cyberpunk has been getting updates continually since release and is awesomely upgraded by this point...I never finished RDR2, but I finished Cyberpunk and am waiting at the edge of my seat for Phantom Liberty, which is going to be a *huge* DLC and should be later this year.  


Cyberpunk.  My two cents."
Limbo,"RDR2, it's much more detailed and alive rather than cyberprank, tho I enjoyed cyberprank (played from friend's console) its just not within the same level of RDR2 also the balancing of story telling and action on RDR2 is peak unlike in cyberpunk you're always just sitting and listening"
Limbo,I don’t usually post on reddit but i just want to make sure that you get RDR2
Limbo,"Both are great, but I think Cyberpunk is the more engaging game. Red Dead suffers from the antiquated Rockstar game design. Almost no freedom during missions, you’re just railroaded through each section and must play it as the developers intend."
Limbo,Red dead 2 is my pick. Cyberpunk was fun but i can’t just sit back and enjoy the world like i can with RDr2
Limbo,"In my opinion, Red Dead Redemption 2 was an incredible experience, especially in the beginning and middle game. However, I found myself getting bored after reaching around 60% completion, as there weren't many new things to explore once I had acquired the best weapon. 

On the other hand, Cyberpunk had superior writing and enjoyable gameplay, but it did suffer from some noticeable bugs."
Limbo,"RDR2 and anyone who says diff is crazy ive completed both games and theres just nothing that compares to RDR2 everything about it is so amazing but for me my fav thing about the game was the story telling. the best storytelling ive ever experienced in a game hands down. it could of been a oscar winning film. i literally cryed during a few scenarios in the game,"
Limbo,Lol EASY choice. RDR2.
Limbo,Are you on pc ? If you don’t wanna keep the games forever. I can tell you how to get them for like 2$ both on steam
Limbo,"I vote rdr, as well. BUT, if you haven't played Witcher 3, that's another great one. Plus, it often heavily discounted."
Limbo,RDR2 and its not even close
Limbo,"Red dead 2. There isn’t a game that has immersed me more than this game, I play butt nekkid and pretend I’m a O’Driscol. 10 Cowboys out of 10"
Limbo,"I’ve played both and loved both, but I fully believe that RDR2 is truly the best game ever, go with that first!"
Limbo,"Rdr2 is very pretty and has some interesting things in it but from a gameplay perspective it's unbelievably barren. You don't even get to aim your gun in this game really and all the missions are basically ""walk here, listen to dialogue, kill guys"".

Cyberpunk at least has some depth to combat. It's a passable first person shooter. Not a great one mind you, but it works. The missions here are also just ""walk here, listen to dialogue, kill guys"".

Personally the dialogue in both these games puts me to sleep and that's like 70% of both. But I guess I would say the Rdr2 dialogue at least feels finished, whereas the cyberpunk dialogue very frequently feels like a placeholder."
Limbo,RDR 2 is a no brainer in this case
Limbo,"Cyberpunk over RDR2. While RDR2 is a great game, i found it slow, and alot of the “immersive” mechanics being pretty surface level and just boring. Unpopular take, but Cyberpunk is more fun."
Limbo,I’d wait till the new expansion for CP2077 comes out. It’s supposed to bring a whole bunch of QOL changes to the base game.
Limbo,RDR2
Limbo,No
Limbo,"RDR2 was fun, but I was more hyped for Cyberpunk 2077. Ended up not caring for RDR2 so much after burning myself out on it, but Cyberpunk absolutely failed me in almost every department. RDR2 is the way to go."
Limbo,"Wait for the cyberpunk dlc to drop before you buy since they are redoing A LOT of the mechanics. I believe it’s September 26 so you have a lot of time to finish red dead. Plus the summer sale is soonish I think so you might be able to get the game and dlc for cheap depending on what price they set. 

I’ve played both and even though it’s been a while since I played cyberpunk and I just finished red dead 3 days ago both are excellent games in their own right but I’d probably play red dead before cyberpunk."
Limbo,**\*\*\* me scrolling through the comments to find the crazy psychopath that chooses cyberpunk over rdr2 \*\*\***
Limbo,Cyberpunk is fun but it doesn’t come close to RDR2.
Limbo,"It depends on what type of games you like, red dead is more story based and polished, but cyberpunk is more ""fuck around and break the game"", but in a good way

Cyberpunk has leveling and a skill tree, and rdr doesn't, so I think you'd like it more

Also red dead was built with miracles or something because it runs like a dream"
Limbo,[removed]
Limbo,Both games are really good but RDR2 is my favourite game all time so pick RDR2
Limbo,"Both are great, but RDR2 is looong but with lots of content"
Limbo,Rdr2
Limbo,Cyberpunk is more fun. RDR2 gets crazy tedious
Limbo,"Red Dead 2 is worth its weight in gold. The story is perfectly told, with some of the best voice acting I've ever heard in a video game. The world is vast, and you never feel like you're completely out of things to do. Bored of missions? Hunt some animals for upgrades to both your player or your camp. Tired of hunting? Put your criminal mind to robbing a store or train. Want to help the law? Check the local sheriff's office for a bounty. The list of activities goes on and on...


So to answer your question, take a break from the cybernetics and neon signs of Night City and go on a breathtaking journey through late 1800's America with Dutch Van der Linde and the gang!"
Limbo,"Go with red dead and play cyberpunk after the last dlc comes out. There will probably some sale for a definitive edition down the line.

Both games are definitely worth to be played."
Limbo,Do you prefer cowboys or cyborgs
Limbo,Finished Rdr2 3 times already and would pay 200$to forget everything and start the game again without remembering anything. Cyberpunk I enjoyed the story but the game was full of bugs and lost the interest of playing it again even if it is fixed or not
Limbo,"I played red dead 2 after it had been out for like 4 years not expecting much. I didn't even buy it, I played my brothers copy, that's the only reason I tried it. It turned out to be my favorite game ever. I'm not particularly interested in the wild west. It felt like watching a movie in the best way possible. It's the only game I can think of where I was sad because I knew it was ending soon. I can't recommend it enough.

I was excited for cyberpunk for years. I was incredibly disappointed when I finally was able to play it, I put about 20 hours in it and feel no urge to continue playing it. Even after they've patched it."
Limbo,"All you need to do is listen to the song ""Video games"" by Tenacious D. You're welcome."
Limbo,RDR2. Cyberpunk's getting totally reworked head to toe alongside new DLC in September and *that's* when you should buy it.
Limbo,RDR2
Limbo,rdr2
Limbo,RDR2!
Limbo,Hmph. Rdr2 is a masterpiece. Cyberpunk quite literally is bad. Phantom liberty sounds very promising on paper but we’ll have to see. So did this game pre release and I’d give it a 5/10.
Limbo,Is this post by OP a joke?
Limbo,RDR2
Limbo,"Rdr2 has a much stronger plot and cast. And the world is gorgeous.

Cyberpunk is also fantastic and a lot of fun, BUT it’s a lot more you having to role play the character"
Limbo,"Loved both, but like everyone has already said, start with RDR2. CP2077 is a fantastic game, but it will get better once the Phantom Liberty update comes out."
Limbo,Rdr2 all day. By far my fav game all time.. online sux d tho.
Limbo,I couldn't get into RDR2 personally. I was enjoying the story and it's the most beautiful game ever made but I thought the gameplay and controls were so rudimentary I stopped at Chapter 3. Meanwhile I really liked Cyberpunk especially the story and although its gameplay isn't groundbreaking it didn't stop me from finishing the game.
Limbo,"Red dead, no doubt."
Limbo,RDR2 is one of the best games humanity has ever witnessed
Limbo,"Most people are saying RD2, but my vote is for Cyberpunk. Bugs aren't as bad now, and the story is great. Along with a bunch of different builds. You can be a ninja with a katana, a run and gun madman, or a tech savvy hacker. The atmosphere is great and helps tie everything together, and the characters you meet really make it amazing. Just like all of CDPR's games, they really go all out with side quests and side story characters. Plus, Phantom Liberty releases in September, so if it's on sale, I would go for it. Cyberpunk is by far one of my favorites, and honestly, RD2 doesn't even get close to my top games.
That being said, both Cyberpunk and RD2 are both amazing games. I just lean more towards Cyberpunk."
Limbo,"I say pick up Cyberpunk, it might be worthwhile to play the game now, with the original story, before playing Phantom Liberty. As Phantom Liberty is very likely going to come with some new endings, and possibly some other changes outside the ones we already know.

Plus I just think its a good game, well worth the money nowadays after 1.5. Mods make it even more fun to play around with. Just an entertaining experience.

On top of that Cyberpunk is truly an RPG, it lets you choose your skills, pick different perks, use different weapons. You truly build your character the way you want. Its very similar to thinks likeSkyrim in that way. Where as Red Dead 2 is just the same character no matter what, there is no leveling system or anything. Its really more of an action adventure title than a true RPG. 

So if you want to get immersed into an RPG and its setting, in similar fashion to things like Skyrim, I recommend 2077."
Limbo,RDR2 with no hesitation and do not read spoilers.
Limbo,"Hey unpopular opinion time. I played both.

RDR2 is certainly a marvel. The story is amazing, graphics are second to none, the protagonist is probably the most well flushed out I've ever experienced in a game, and overall the game really is a must play.

....but it's a bit of a drag yeah? It's very slow paced, and I found myself just wanting to play other games from time to time. This isn't really a negative point, and is definitely subjective, but man it can DRAG. 



Cyberpunk (post patches) is a wild ride. The story is a blast, and really kicks. The set pieces are way above what I expected in an open world game. The side quests, as expected from CDPR are just as good, if not better than the main story in many cases. Definitely a case of art direction trumping graphical fidelity. While it doesn't look bad by any stretch... Walking though Chinatown in the middle of the night is a sight to behold. Vibrant neon lighting, crowded streets, some guy getting mugged in an alley, the constant cacophony of people shouting and talking... I haven't felt that level of immersion in a game... Maybe ever.

Yeah it's a bit of a mess. But way better than the sum of its parts. Unfortunately I listened to the online griping, and missed out for longer than necessary, but take from someone who was hesitant, it blew me away.

At the end of the day Cyberpunk is just ***fun***. The shooting is chunky and effective, the driving is arcady but feels good, the plot and characters are fucking bonkers, and there really are just so many ways to play the game.

I played it the first time as a learning curve. A little hacking, a little shotgun, a little melee. It was pure chaos and really felt like I was a newbie in night city trying to climb to the top.

Second time thru and I'm playing full stealth. Feels like a totally different game. I walk in an alley, activate my speed implant, turn invisible, and walk through putting a bullet in everyone's head. Come out the other side, and watch the bodies drop before the cameras ever had a chance to catch me. Suddenly I felt like an elite level assassin that was born and bred in this world.


You can't go wrong either way, but I tip towards CP"
Limbo,"cyberpunk, rdr2 is a linear game in an open world setting with the most boring chapter 1 in existence, also everything you do (pointless animation) is so slow and infuriating that you can fall asleep"
Limbo,I think rdr2 has more replayability if that matter to you as far as stretching your dollar. I dont find myself excitingly opening cyberpunk. I felt like 1 playthrough was enough to get a big grasp of the game.
Limbo,"Rdr2 is a masterpiece. It’s slow paced but if you adapt your speed to it, rather than trying to force it to your speed, it’s fantastic! It is the most alive environment of any game I’ve played. Can interact with just about everything too. And npc’s actually seem like they are more than objects moving around the screen."
Limbo,RDR2 is one of the greatest games ever made.
Limbo,"I have both. The answer is both. Just get both, play them both for less than two-hours each, and refund the one you don’t want."
Limbo,"Unquestionably RDR2 is the better, more fully realized game. 

I think the best question to answer from a prospective standpoint, however, is what is your preferred gaming experience? Do you like 'slow' as a concept? Do you enjoy being diverted from whatever you initially planned doing? If a game world is both fun and immersive, are you happy with killing an hour or two wandering around it and not focusing on story progression? If yes to all of the above, You will love RDR2. If you are very task oriented and want everything to be a quick hit, then RDR2 isn't going to be your cup of tea regardless of its (excellent) level of quality.

That's generally what people mean when they say this game is divisive. The less patient get frustrated with its deliberateness."
Limbo,Wait until the Cyberpunk expansion comes out at a discount. It will probably be in its best state at that point.
Limbo,"Red Dead 2 all the way. It took me like 3 attempts of replaying the beginning before I finally got hooked on the game and I wish it didn’t cause I’ve been missing out! 

It’s such a beautiful game. The guns are dope, (just experiment, you can’t lose unless you don’t like the gun which you can just store away) and the world is vast but alive

Like you’ll suddenly get ambushed or some fools will try to rob you; or woodcutters are felling trees, or a criminal is complaining on the back of a horse tied up"
Limbo,I played both RDR2 on s a great experience but a little slower pace. Cyberpunk was broke and I fell off before I completed it
Limbo,"Both are on sale pretty often but I would do RDR2 first without question. There are certain games you absolutely have to at least play. Don’t have to finish it if it don’t click but it’s an absolute must play. Cyberpunk is a great story with not the best gameplay, plus very raunchy. It’s gotten much better over the years however."
Limbo,Red dead 2 is leagues better imo
Limbo,Rdr2 is probably the best story in a game I have ever played. Full stop. It is genuinely one of the most amazing game stories there is. I would recommend it over cyberpunk based on that alone
Limbo,Red Dead 1st by far
Limbo,"Imo they are both very enjoyable from a story and gameplay angle. Some of it comes to taste (do you want a Wild West game or futuristic urban environment?). In my opinion you can’t go wrong but there is a reason Red Dead 2 is considered one of the greatest single player games of all time. 


Also, if this matters, cyberpunk is a 30-50 hour game if you complete the story and do a lot of side quests. Red dead 2 is more of a 50+ hour kind of game."
Limbo,RDR2
Limbo,I would say red dead now and cyberpunk later
Limbo,"Cause I don't play video games no more
Never play video games
But Red Dead Redemption 2, that is not a game
It's an incredible journey through old American history
Fighting for your life and fighting for your family
Try to live your days with honor and integrity
That's not a game, that's an adult thing
That's not a game at all
That's like fuckin' Shakespeare
- Jack Black"
Limbo,"Objectively RDR2 is the better game in almost every way, and it’s also cheaper right now. But man I can’t help but absolutely adore cyberpunk, even more than red dead. My brain says get red dead but my heart says get cyberpunk"
Limbo,"Cyberpunk is pretty cool, but RDR2 is a goddamn masterpiece."
Limbo,"If you like first person action RPG and sci -fi allot like I do Cyberpunk carried the magic. After the millionth plot twist I gave up on Rdr2, cyberpunk is short sweet and tragic."
Limbo,I would say get red dead. It honestly looks like the better game out of the two and you can always get a refund if you really don't like it.
Limbo,"Red dead 2, 100%"
Limbo,Could not put RDR2 down finished in under a month. Cyberpunk took me at least 4.
Limbo,99.9% of time my answer to this sub is just r/piratedgames
Limbo,rdr2 all the way
Limbo,Red Dead Redemption 2 !
Limbo,Rdr 2
Limbo,Both are amazing and should be played but get rdr2 first and wait till the new dlc to get cyberpunk.
Limbo,"RDR2 is to date the best single game I’ve ever played by far.

It’s a masterpiece."
Limbo,RDR2. Without a doubt.
Limbo,RDR2
Limbo,Do you want rootin tootin cowboy shootin or stressy messy cyborg depressy?
Limbo,"I love both, but cyberpunk is good and RDR2 is next level amazing."
Limbo,"In between missions, RDR2 is quite therapeutic to play."
Limbo,"Late to the party, but would like to share my thoughts:

CP2077 has some fantastic writing and beautiful graphics. That being said, it’s a very shallow game in every other department. Given the world-building, it has amazing potential. If they had just given the game another couple years to incubate, it easily could’ve been one of the greatest action-adventure RPGs of its time. 

RDR2 is, on the other hand, *also* a game that has fantastic writing and beautiful graphics. It is, however, the type of game that *did* get the time it needed to fully flesh out all the other aspects of its gameplay. The result is a highly immersive experience with a lot of replayability and content that can last you hundreds of hours."
Limbo,"It's not even really a fair comparison. 

RDR2 is a ridiculous rich and developed world with unbelievable detail (sometimes to much) and a story that is extremely engaging. It also has some of the best NPC reactions/interactions and is probably one of the top 3 hunting games in the last decade all rolled into one.

Cyberpunk is a mostly dead world with poor interactivity with npcs, a convoluted story that barely makes sense, and is almost entirely empty. I know I mentioned dead and empty twice but it needed repeating. The game had so much potential it didn't live up to its ridiculous. The games AI is almost as bad as basic vanilla skyrim back in the day. Luckily most of the bugs seem to have been dealt with but the game is still not worth buying in my opinion"
Limbo,I've played both. They're both pretty good. Rdr2 is the best of the 2.
Limbo,def red dead!
Limbo,I have never met someone who didnt like rdr2 but cyberpunk seems to be hit or miss i have friends who love it but i have had no enjoyment playing it at all
Limbo,"Cyberpunk is one of my all-time favourites, but Red Dead II is objectively the GOAT"
Limbo,RDR 2 and don't think twice. Cyberpunk is good but RDR2 is a masterpiece and goated.
Limbo,"I haven't played Cyberpunk yet, but RDR2 is a must play. I held off on playing RDR2 for a long time, due to people saying its slow paced. That was a mistake. I didn't feel slow to me, because the story is so good. If it was a movie, it would get an Oscar."
Limbo,Rdr2 first and then cyberpunk
Limbo,RDR2 no contest
Limbo,RDR2 is at minimum a top 10 all time must play game
Limbo,Red dead is wayyyy better than cyber.
Limbo,"10/10 ""wild west"" (kind of) open world with a 10/10 story or a, well, cyberpunk open world with a 9,5/10 story


your call"
Limbo,"Rdr2 is amazing. Cyberpunk is great and one of the better open world games I've played ever. I've played a lot of games and I adore this game. Wasn't perfect obviously with the console bugs but it's still great. If you're on pc then get it,next gen consoles then yeah. Previous gen then definitely no. 

After playing both, I can say both are great and damn good games. RDR2 is a masterpiece and Cyberpunk could one day end up being remembered as one. If not for the bugs and launch issues then kt would've been perfect imo"

Limbo,"Cyberpunk is one of the more fun games I've played in years.  Red dead redemption 2 is the single greatest game I've ever played. Play both, but start with red dead."
Limbo,How much is rdr2? I just bought it for $70? 😭😭😭😭
Limbo,Anyone who is a gamer must play RDR2
Limbo,Cyberpunk. That's just me though. This is really a question you need to ask yourself.
Limbo,"Well I would say both, but I would suggest leaving cyberpunk aside until Phantom Liberty comes out and you can experience it at its highest. So for now, I recommend Red Dead. It's very fun, finished it recently, couldn't put my controller down, one week of my holiday gone, spent 110 hours on the game. Just don't overwhelm yourself and don't rush too much with the story, just enjoy the game's atmosphere and its randomness and progress in the story in whatever way feels best to you.

If you worry about completionism, I recommend making a manual save for everytime you start a new chapter."
Limbo,Cyberpunk has finally gotten out of the shadow of its launch and is finally the game it was promised to be. But RDR 2 would be Rockstar’s masterpiece if the first game and GTA V didn’t already exist. Definitely check both games out but give Red Dead Redemption 2 a try first.
Limbo,I liked Cyberpunk a lot but RDR2 is the way to go
Limbo,Cyberpunk only because it going to get a overhaul that makes the game worth playing but red dead 2 is hella fun as well so wouldn't blame you if you got that over it since cyberpunk started off bad and kept people off it.
Limbo,RDR2. It has an amazing story.
Limbo,I haven't played Cyberpunk but RDR2 is such a masterpiece so that's my vote :)
Limbo,Red Dead Redemption is a masterpiece. Cyberpunk in its current state is fine but nowhere near RDR2 level.
Limbo,RDR2
Limbo,"I played both, and 110% would pick RDR2 over cyberpunk. I think I’ve replayed it 4 times now. Played through Cyberpunk once and haven’t felt much like going back. Just a richer story in RDR2."
Limbo,"i know everyone and their mom has already said it in this comment section, but i’m gonna add my voice to the choir anyways: rdr2 first, without a doubt."
Limbo,RDR2 is great. would never spend money on cyberjunk
Limbo,Rdr2 is slow as fuck cyberpunk is fast paced so i would go for cyberpunk (haven't been a fan of slow paced walking and riding Sims no matter how good the story is if they can't give it to me in a faster manner or keep me retained i ain't bout that)
Limbo,RDR 2
Limbo,"Wow, someone needs to rep cyberpunk here.  I loved it.  Best game of last 5 years for me.

Rdr2 was boring for me.  Scenery was pretty and all but I just found it repetitive.  Ride horse, shoot, do boring camp stuff, etc.  I dunno I like doing that stuff in real life.  

Cyberpunk is just super fun.  The soundtrack bangs.. you get swords implanted in your arms... the lore is super interesting.. lots of meaningful choices.  It's the only game I've ever replayed 

CP got a bad rap at launch.  I get it.  But on PS5 today it rocks"
Limbo,"Cyberpunk will have a GOTY edition either with Phantom Liberty’s release or shortly thereafter. Acquiring RDR2 right now makes more sense, at least to me."
Limbo,Buy rdr2 and when cyberpunk gets a complete edition buy that one later on
Limbo,Both are incredible. I would not recommend getting Cyberpunk on a PS4 as it just stops working for me after like an hour of play time. RDR2 is a considerably better game but both are worth it
Limbo,"Play RDR, then go to the second one - you won't regret it."
Limbo,"I'm playing Cyberpunk rn and while id say it is a very good game and looks incredible, it is still nowhere near as polished as RDR2, combat, movement, interactions, npcs, customization and most of the things that make an open world/exploration game good are better in RDR2 in my opinion. But id still recommend you to get Cyberpunk later, it is a great game."
Limbo,"Red dead 2, Cyberpunk isn't bad now, but RDR2 still has a good case for being the best game of all time."
Limbo,I would get RDR2 first. Its long game with a much better story imo. Plus cyberpunk is getting that expansion in a few months that'll be overhauling some gameplay mechanics.
Limbo,Cyberpunk.
Limbo,"Red dead’s storymode is god tier, online can be amazing, Cyberpunk is very good, Perosnally I’d say red dead if you’ll play the online, cyberpunk if ur not gonna play the online"
Limbo,"I say it depends on your system. I have a PS4 slim and cyberpunk is unplayable after the last large update. Gonna have to get a ps5 to actually play it. Could be my save corrupted somehow, but the game freezes after 20 minutes almost religiously."
Limbo,RDR2 is one the best video games ever made. Definitely go for that first.
Limbo,RDR2 any day of the week.
Limbo,"Play RDR2 first and then buy Cyberpunk when the new expansion drops. I love both games, but it sounds like CP2077: Phantom Liberty will be the definitive edition"
Limbo,"I would recommend both, but you need to play RDR2 if you haven't first"
Limbo,Red dead redemption 2 a million times over cyberpunk
Limbo,"RDR2, absolutely."
Limbo,"I think cyberpunk and the expansion are on sale right now. But I’d go for rdr2 first considering it will be more instant gratification then having to wait till December for the expansion on cyberpunk, which will have a ton of new content meant to make the experience way better."
Limbo,"Cyberpunk is poorly written, rdr2 is a masterclass"
Limbo,RDR2 by a mile
Limbo,"I played both games this year. I haven't finished Cyberpunk yet but it's pretty fun, I love everything about it except for some game breaking bugs and funny braindead AI. Both games are great but RDR2 is a triump; storytelling, characters, sound design, voice acting and impressive life-like world with a lot of details and hidden gems in it although gameplay is your standard Rockstar game, it's still an immersive game."
Limbo,"I would recommend that you never buy cyberpunk and if Red dead is your thing, go for it. (It’s not my thing. But seriously, don’t buy cyberpunk.)"
Limbo,Definitely Red Dead Redemption 2. Best game i have ever played since 2006
Limbo,"huge cyberpunk fan here, i'd probably buy it when phantom liberty comes out since they're overhauling everything. RDR2 however was a masterpiece when it came out. definitely grab it, especially if on sale"
Limbo,RDR2 will make you question if any game you ever played was good at all.
Limbo,"Fair warning. I also say RDR2, BUT you need to go into it realizing it IS intentionally slower paced. Take your time with it, really invest in the characters and just hang out in the world, exploring and such. However, that said, I absolutely LOVE RDR2. It’s my favorite of all time."
Limbo,Rdr2
Limbo,"Both are really good 

I really enjoyed RDR2 a lot but Cyberpunk has something that really made me love it. 

I don't know if it's the setting or the overall dystopian world but it's a really great experience now

Plus Phantom Liberty is coming in september I believe so it might be worth a try"
Limbo,"Both are on par and considered masterpieces of their own, CP story is more complex and fast paced while RDR2 is more of a slow burn kind of story. I think that CP is the superior game but I think you should buy both."
Limbo,"Imo RDR2 is superior in essentially every aspect, I would definitely try it out."
Limbo,Get both
Limbo,"Definitely RDR2, seriously it contains the best protagonist you’ll ever play."
Limbo,"Red dead is a must - cyberpunk is a should, so play RDR 2 first, then when the DLC is out pick up cyberpunk"
Limbo,RDR2. I played both but for me RDR2 is just better.
Limbo,"RDR2 barring it’s online is easily one of the best games ever made in my opinion. Same goes for RDR1, which can be played in either order. On top of that there’s undead nightmare as an added plus"
Limbo,"I love both. But if I had to choose, it would be RDR2"
Limbo,"Honestly both are really great games, you should pick based on what type of world you would like to dive into. Dystopian future, vs movie western."
Limbo,Rdr2 killed my parents. We’re happily married now.
Limbo,"RDR2 for sure!!!! I'm playing it again right now. Easily in my top 10 greatest games of all time. And with the amount of games I've played over 30+ years, that is really saying something."
Limbo,Honestly they are both amazing In their own rights. RDR2 is considered one of the best games of all time tho so it’s an easy pick
Limbo,"Obvious answer is rdr 2 first, but let me say this. No open world game will ever be the same after rdr2. Its miles ahead any game ive played to this day, technically and story wise."
Limbo,"Both games are amazing. You can't go wrong with either - great storyline, great side quests, you can just dig yourself in for hours and hours. I'd highly recommend both. But if I had to pick one, I'd say RDR2. It left a bigger impression on me after finishing it."
Limbo,"RDR2 is probably the better game from a technical standpoint, but I found the controls kind of kludgy to be honest.  I beat it once and have never felt the desire to replay it.

Cyberpunk on the other hand is the kind of game I can beat then immediately want to start a new character.  Yeah, it's undoubtably not as polished, but I just had more fun with it.  (Again, a big part of this probably just comes back to the controls, which were a lot smoother in Cyberpunk.)

Honestly...  You should just  get them BOTH!"
Limbo,Rdr2 is easily the greatest console game ever made
Limbo,"They’re very different games which is something to bare in mind. However, RDR2 is a much more polished product. I’d play that first and then pick up 2077/Phantom Liberty because they have basically said that the entire game is getting overhauled and polished with the next update/DLC in September. Both games will grip you emotionally as they’re very well written"
Limbo,I played through cyberpunk twice. I stopped playing RDR2 when I got bored of riding my horsey.
Limbo,Cyberpunk. Honestly RDR2 kind of bored me
Limbo,And I will play it. Thanks for the reply.
Limbo,Yeah what else is there to say? Although Cyberpunk is very enjoyable
Limbo,I would say portal is a triumph.
Limbo,"Sure, I guess then RDR2 it is. Thanks for the reply."
Limbo,I won't pass on either but I guess first I will go through RDR2. Thanks for the reply.
Limbo,I didn't feel the same. What is so unmissable about red dead for you?
Limbo,To be honest it really depends. Personally I felt Red dead was a little to realistic for me and Cyber punk was more actiony.
Limbo,">It will give you a thrill, make you feel like a badass, and then leave you in tears.

beautifully said."
Limbo,Yes.
Limbo,Same here it's hard to get into other games since I've played rdr2 I keep going back to it.
Limbo,"Yeah, I guess waiting for the new update and dlc is the best option as new things will be added along with overhauls. Thanks for the reply."
Limbo,What kind of depth does rdr2 have?
Limbo,"Yeah. I just saw the dlc as pre-order along with Cyberpunk, but I think it will not be a great idea to buy it as they are adding and overhauling some features of the game in the next update probably. I guess waiting atleast till the update will be the right choice. Thanks for the reply."
Limbo,I’ve just started the game is it best to wait for the DLC then and when does it drop ?
Limbo,Phantom Pain is Metal Gear Solid. Cyberpunk 2077's expansion is called Phantom Liberty.
Limbo,Do you know if ultimate version of RDR2 is worth it?
Limbo,Any other game similar to rdr2 in gameplay? I love the sort of chill vibes with the option of action.
Limbo,Careful it's CP2077
Limbo,"Just a minor note that the outfit issue was fixed with a transmog function, so now you can play dress up and not just worry about stats.  But if you want to see your own outfit you have to drive a motorcycle."
Limbo,Should I finish cyberpunk before the dlc?
Limbo,"Yeah same here, RDR2 was amazing but I was way more immersed in Cyberpunk's world than RDR2's one 

Though both are really great games and should be played imo"
Limbo,"Sorry to bother, but I would also like to ask which edition of RDR2 should I get. I will tell beforehand that I don't think I will be playing online version of the game."
Limbo,I think most people agree that RDR2’s story is great and the strongest part of the game besides the visuals.
Limbo,"Bruh. Who has the audacity to say RDR2 doesn’t have a good story?

It’s been widely, widely lauded as having one of the best stories in recent years"
Limbo,"Thanks. I think story is subjective so might really like RDR2 too as I am not a huge fan of futuristic world. Though I am not a huge fan of Cowboys either (mediaeval fan here), though I might like it if I play it. Thanks for replying, I might get RDR2 now and wait for the update and expansion of Cyberpunk."
Limbo,"I don't know about the story, but the best video game character is BT-7274. Period."
Limbo,"This is how I feel. Cyberpunk was faster paced and I got more immediate gratification. I actually still haven’t gotten very far in RDR2 just because it has been slower-paced, but that being said, it is an exceptionally well-designed game"
Limbo,"You’ve just described my exact experience. I really enjoyed RDR2 but we had just had our first baby when the it released - I just didn’t have the time and it fell by the wayside as a result, so I never finished it. Cyberpunk I managed to complete several times over on PS4 Pro and one more on PS5. Every single play through I’ve played completely differently to the last. It’s been immense. The sheer variety on offer with the story and the play styles means totally different experiences each time. While Red Dead is a beautiful and epic experience - it’s a fairly unilateral one. The only real variety coming from how many side missions or how much peripheral content you want to pursue. My wife played Cyberpunk more than I did - her sessions were vastly different to mine. I haven’t seen anything quite like it since the likes of Elder Scrolls."
Limbo,“HANK! DON’T ABBREVIATE CYBERPUNK LIKE THAT! HAAAAANK!”
Limbo,Not really. Where is the single player content?
Limbo,"Same is experience. RDR2 more polished and you interact with more things, and NPC has better reactions. But cyberpunk is just more fun to play.

My biggest issue with rockstar games is that on rails and very linear. That’s being said they still quality games and will buying the next Rockstar game when it comes out."
Limbo,You can always turn off aim assist for a better challenge in RDR2
Limbo,What do you mean by terrible gameplay in RDR2?
Limbo,"Yeah, just saw the amount of things they are adding in the update and expansion. Some of it is overhaul of current systems so I guess waiting for the update and the dlc is the best thing for now. Anyways, I would like to ask one more thing, should I buy RDR2 on Epic store or Steam because as far as I have heard, Epic store has a really bad mod support for games. And I guess there some fine mods for RDR2 so would like to get my hands on them. Thanks."
Limbo,"> game i *paid* for. So

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*"
Limbo,"I played the game about a year ago and only experienced like 5 bugs, none of them even being close to game breaking"
Limbo,I bought and played a month or so ago and experienced almost 0 bugs. I think one quest messed up and that was it. After the most recent patch it seems pretty good. Also looks amazing with the ray tracing.
Limbo,">the janky controls are super frustrating and honestly it’s pretty slow at times. I don’t need to watch long animations every time I pick something up or do anything. It’s more cowboy sim than game.  
>  
>Tried it 3 times and never make it past 10 hrs or so.

Not every game is made for you."
Limbo,you think cyberpunk is a fail because of first week youtube videos and headlines. mostly everyone that plays the game says it is on track to becoming a no man's sky type revive
Limbo,Cyberpunk absolutely does not have better writing…
Limbo,no reason to skip one of the greatest games of this generation
Limbo,"How is it overrated, there’s no game that has that level of detail, i can understand not enjoying the slow paced gameplay, but you can’t deny that no game has pushed the boundaries of open world like red dead in terms of immersion."
Limbo,sure buddy go play ludo
Limbo,You're getting hate but it's true. RD2 felt more like an interactive movie than a game.
Limbo,"For reference, I have played both and love both, I even lean towards rdr2, but I am recommending based on OP's interests, unlike most of you"

Limbo,I’ll be honest I thought RDR2 was a tedious piece of trash and nothing like the first game. Cyberpunk   Is more fun and you’ll want to play it more.
Limbo,"Cyberpunk is getting a big expansion in September, along with a huge update that overhauls the whole game pretty much. Definitely hit RDR first and then grab cyberpunk after the update sometime."
Limbo,Great story.  Great gameplay.  Great experience overall.
Limbo,"I think it has some serious flaws but most of those flaws are in line with the vision of the game rather than being oversights. Like all the animations and forced walk sections, or the controls not being very arcadey with no jump button. The main flaw that defies this rule is the absurdly on-the-rails quests, which are typical for Rockstar.

All of that being said, it was in many ways a masterwork. Unparalleled attention to detail. Felt great to explore and discover. Could sink absurd hours into it or just pick up and play, and either way is fun. I find myself coming back to it all the time and finding things I missed.

It was imo the first Open World to feature both breadth and depth in world design without being riddled with bugs. You can tell the crunch went into perfecting the details rather than throwing the game together.

Gameplay and story not revolutionary but consistently solid."
Limbo,It’s an absolute masterpiece.
Limbo,"I've played and beaten both, and I love both games. That being said RDR2 is a fucking masterpiece. I don't know any game I'd pick over rdr2 in a one on one."
Limbo,"It's probably the deepest and most fully realized open world ever crafted, filled with rich and compelling characters, emergent choices, and awesome things to discover. It's held up by many experts as one of the iconic examples of video games as art. But go off, chief. Contrarianism is all the rage."
Limbo,"It would be easier to list what components of RDR2 *do not* have depth:

Enemies - it's all pew pew guys across the board.

Mounts - it's all horses across the board.

As for narrative, gameplay, world building, world interaction, customization, side missions, character developments, npc interactions, etc. etc. etc., I could go on but I've given your clearly catty, insincere comment enough effort and time, maybe just become more interesting in the future and open up with a compelling point next time."
Limbo,September 26.
Limbo,Haha very true that was a Freudian slip!
Limbo,"If you can get it cheap then maybe but I don't think it's worth it, personally."
Limbo,Rdr1 is the only one I can think of
Limbo,GTA
Limbo,Death Stranding I suppose both tedious games but are top 3 for me
Limbo,Oh that’s good to know. And thanks for the correction
Limbo,No they plan to overhaul the ai and make other changes. (Better Skill tree for example)
Limbo,"In which case, the cheapest version. The ultimate edition just has online content iirc"
Limbo,"Is the story really good or are the characters just carrying everything? Playing rn and the story is kind of meh. Rockstar games never really had a great main story, but that is not necessary with all the fun.

Not saying I'm right, just how I am feeling right now."
Limbo,[deleted]
Limbo,"Many actually. And even as a huge fan myself, I understand that the pacing of that story is all over the place and many of my friends drop it after initial 2-3 snowy hours and I keep on trying to convince them."
Limbo,"When I was contemplating rdr2 I felt like you. I also was unsure about the horse riding mechanic, as I was used to GTA and using vehicles. And I was unsure I would enjoy the 1899 setting. But let me tell you, get this game! It’s so good. You will end up being fascinated with the world, including the horse riding."
Limbo,"I've tried to get into RDR2 multiple times, I really appreciate the quality and complexity of the game, but I just can't, because I find the entire cowboy setting to be boring and uninteresting."
Limbo,"The game was so good and complete at release, it didn’t need it."
Limbo,"There's a reason why they made auto aim the default in RDR2, because the combat is so clunky that it needs it"
Limbo,It’s a very boring gameplay that’s for sure.
Limbo,Mainly because the mission design and combat are so bad
Limbo,"I play on PS5, so I wouldn't know much about epic store vs steam. Maybe try asking on the Red Dead sub, they will probably give better answers than I could"
Limbo,You can mod pretty much everygame on steam just as well if not better than epic. Some games even have steam cumunity mods through the steam store such as l4d2. Really the only reason id choose epic over steam for anything is if epic is giving a game away for free and even them there are some cases where id still just rather buy it from steam.
Limbo,Good bot
Limbo,The freind i borrowed it from said the same thing so i guess it varied from person to person. My experience was a mess. Nothing game breaking in the sense that i couldn't progress but a lot of religing becouse i got stuck in terminals and uis. Also had this one where jackie always had his gun out no matter what animtion he was doing or where he was. Even had it on that mission where we coukdnt bring our guns. Nothing could have been done to fix that one just had to accept that that was jakie now for that playthrough
Limbo,"Im with this guy, never had any game breaking bugs in this game from day 1. Playing PC with a good gpu over on my end tho. If youve got a 30 series gpu or newer cyberpunk runs literally fine"
Limbo,Yeah thats one thing i can personally attest to it looks really good. Also it supports dlss 3 fram generation so it runs really smooth a 4000 series card.
Limbo,"This is a stupid fucking reply

Nowhere did they say that. They're allowed to criticise the controls of a game when someone asks for opinions on that game. Opinions from both sides are important when deciding whether to buy something or not."
Limbo,Never said it was.
Limbo,It's widely agreed the controls and combat are super clunky.
Limbo,"Opinions are opinions my dude, both games had amazing writing but I felt more connected to Cyberpunk."
Limbo,Guess the opinions are divided. I didn't like rdr2's writing very much. What was so great about it then?
Limbo,I agree about the level of detail. For sure it's impressive in that aspect. It's just soooo fucking slooow man. I almost didn't finish that game considering how tedious it was. I'm sorry.
Limbo,Ok
Limbo,"Tedious as f... imo. I almost didn't finish it, but the story got me through. Gameplay was the worst!"
Limbo,"Weird, I was raised by fast paced shooters and such and absolutely adored rdr2 despite its slower nature."
Limbo,"Want to cook some food? 10 minute animation per piece cooked. Want to loot something? 10 minute animation of you picking the body up. Want to skin an animal? 45 minute animation. Oh, and btw, you need hundreds of pelts if you want to do side content. It is the most ridiculous shit.

Everyone kept telling me I needed to get to chapter 2 to really get a feel for the game. I made it past chapter 2 and I still hate the game. Only now I'm past my refund window and hate it even more now.

Every mission is you riding with some member of your crew on horseback for 45 minutes while you get gigantic exposition dumps. RDR2 is the game you get when you distill the WORST parts of the GTA franchise down into a cowboy game.

This was the first game that was universally praised, in a genre I love, that I hated to it's core. It has me questioning whether or not i should even bother buying the last of us on PC."
Limbo,Where are details on the huge update? Can’t seem to find any but very interested
Limbo,Still playing cyberpunk on a console like ps5 is like playing in a ghost town. If OP has a decent rig he should definitely hit cyberpunk in September.
Limbo,"Wasn't this supposed to come out this month? I am very excited about the DLC, but I'll believe the release date once I've downloaded it."
Limbo,"Will they completely drop their sad excuse for an armor system, their sad excuse for a weapon system, and their sad excuse for a perk system? Oh wait… that’s like every system in the damn game. Would be silly to ask for that.

Edit: holy shit it looks like they are!"
Limbo,"I thought it was very visually impressive and well acted. Also the soundtrack fucking slaps. I love the soundtrack. It also usually managed to capture the intended vibe very well. But it wasn't very thought-provoking. And some of the side content just completely misses the mark. 

Cyberpunk is a lot less polished and pleasant. But some of the sidequests could have carried entire high-quality indiegames."
Limbo,"Trailing missions, long ass point a to point b travel, goofy ah shooting, extremely linear missions, breaking the games economy with that stage coach robbery mission. Can’t deny the flaws."
Limbo,Did not know a simple question was a clearly catty insincere comment....
Limbo,"Lol what a pathetically insecure reply. RDR2 has absolutely zero depth when it comes to gameplay, mission structure, level design, or npc interactions. It’s all shallow set dressing for a pretty decent story that would’ve worked better as a TV series. As an actual videogame, it’s average at best."
Limbo,"> I've given your clearly catty, insincere comment enough effort and time, maybe just become more interesting in the future and open up with a compelling point next time.

You’re right - how dare he ask a simple question about your favourite game?! The audacity of /u/ihave0idea0 knows no limits! 

Personally I find RDR2 wholly unappealing to me, mostly because what I’ve seen of the combat mechanics seems quite repetitive and more importantly not skill-based.  
But I also don’t like the Elder Scrolls series or Cyberpunk for the same reason, so this thread just isn’t for me."
Limbo,"Yeah, been through that. And online doesn't do it for me"
Limbo,I actually have that. Might give it a try
Limbo,Oh I’ll wait then damn okay thanks.
Limbo,Thank you very much.
Limbo,"It’s definitely more character driven than plot driven. It might take a while for the story to get going, but when it does, it’s really some of the best dramatic writing I’ve ever seen in anything. It’s worth sticking with for sure."
Limbo,"… that’s what a story is, a journey of characters through an arc. The plot of 99% of stories is the same basic shit."
Limbo,"Fair, I can’t seem to get into Witcher 3, despite being a huge fan of the lore and gameplay.

It just… feels so huge and cumbersome"
Limbo,Yeah the story feels very disjointed. You do like 5 completely unrelated main story missions and then eventually come across another mission that advances the story. How’s that a great story? I get that people like those unrelated main missions since they like long games and are willing to tolerate a somewhat disjointed story if it means a longer game. But you can’t tell me that’s a good story. A good story must have a good flow.
Limbo,Rdr2 is easily top 5 of last gen
Limbo,"Yeah it's not even gameplay.
Just high quality movie"
Limbo,Tried that but didn't get any answer. Other modding subreddits had no idea either. I guess I will try asking there again. Thank you very much.
Limbo,"Actually had a coupon on epic store, so wouldn't want it to go to waste. I have some other the list but would live to know if epic store version can be modded. The RDR2 subreddit seems kinda dead with most of the posts with no replies so I think I might not get one there either."
Limbo,Best bot
Limbo,">This is a stupid fucking reply

Exactly my thoughts lol.

I absolutely loved RDR2 but I can totally see how it can be boring for some people. In fact, I've seen plenty of comments on various subs saying exactly that, so I think it's important thing to highlight for OP."
Limbo,"It was cool at first but then I just got tired of it quick. I also work 50hrs a week with like 1 hour commute one way so I just don’t have time for slow games anymore. 
That being said getting off a horse just to pick something up every time is just an awful game play design."
Limbo,What a debby downer you are. Pessimistic much? Lol
Limbo,Valid
Limbo,"[Check it](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/147domj/everything_new_with_phantom_liberty_and_patch_17/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)

I’m pretty excited"
Limbo,It says September 26th on steam. Even if you don't get the DLC you still get access to the massive overhaul btw.
Limbo,I think the side content is amazing. Maybe some things could be better but it is very good
Limbo,"Yeah I get that but thought provoking is not what I expect from Rockstar, or any game outside of select RPGs.

It’s more like a great execution of a tried and true formula. If I wanted a thought provoking Western, I’d reread Blood Meridian, not play an open world game."
Limbo,There’s nothing thought provoking about Cyperpunk either
Limbo,They’re not flaws…  They’re features!
Limbo,Yeah rockstar hasn't improved it's gameplay since GTA San Andreas. It's a shame because visually and story wise the games are brilliant
Limbo,"It's not a simple question, it's probably the most highly praised game of the last decade, pretending that you know nothing about it whatsoever and have decided to randomly come to me to learn more about it is naive and stupid at best."
Limbo,"And this is the kind of dumbass mentality that went behind asking 'hurr, what kind of depth rdr2 got?'"
Limbo,"The OP asked which game should he play, not your emotional personal take that doesn’t help at all and literally NO ONE cares about"
Limbo,I hear you. Just the most similar gameplay I could think of. Basically the same game at a different time period with different technology.
Limbo,"Story wise, propably. Gameplay, definetly not."
Limbo,I dont see why not you wouldnt be able too. Modding alters your local files on your system so i feel like whichever store front you bought it from wouldnt matter. All the games ive ever modded were on steam but i never had to actually interact with steam to do it so i feel like the same processes would have worked even if i bought them from epic.
Limbo,"Fair enough, that horse thing is true"
Limbo,"Everyone I know loves this game. So I never criticize it around them, because I would feel like a debbie downer. It was just exciting to finally see someone else hate it."
Limbo,Everything he said is valid and he’s entitled to his opinion. That isn’t pessimism
Limbo,"The shredder of panda guy I’m replying to blocked  me, then reported me to Reddit for some kinda wellness check?? People are so weird.. wtf"
Limbo,"Thank you. 

Man I am hype now."
Limbo,I'm happy for you. That I didn't feel the same doesn't mean I want to take that away from you
Limbo,"I don't think thought provoking was something they were not trying to do. The story of the main characters in what is essentially a cult was compelling but just not for that long. 

Also looking at cyberpunk again. I think there are plenty of moments there that could be labeled thought provoking. 

Maybe I just wanted the wrong things from the game."
Limbo,"No? What about Joshua's quest line? Rivers quest line? The quests with the mayor and his wife? V's story, the different endings. Even the quest with the vending machine ends up asking some interesting questions."
Limbo,Let’s hope for gta 6 I personally didn’t like rdr2 as much as other people did for personal reasons but I still thought it was a fantastic game
Limbo,"Damn, you even double-downed on it.

People ARE allowed to not know everything about RDR2, man.

You clearly spend a lot of time thinking about your favourite video games - that’s fine, but you should realise that other people may have other interests and may actually not know much about it, if at all.

As I said I personally find the gameplay uninteresting (not sure how you can think it has a lot of depth, tbh) - and a game without good gameplay is just a bad game to me. Therefore I have little interest in Rockstar games in general, because their gameplay is usually super casual-oriented.

As for the rest of you description of the depth of the game, you used a bunch of buzz-words but didn’t actually explaining anything to the guy.

Good graphics, good story, world building, character development and voice acting are great, but if that’s all there is to it, I’d rather watch a movie or read a book tbh. Gameplay is where games are at for me, and a lot of people in general."
Limbo,"Did you mean to reply to someone else?

How am I the emotional one for replying to someone having a complete meltdown at the mère idea that someone didn’t know the alleged qualities of RDR2?

I explained why I thought that neither games thought of by OP were particularly good in my opinion. That’s very relevant to the discussion.

What’s the point of your needlessly aggressive comment that no one asked for and no one cares about, to use your own words?"
Limbo,Exactly. However I think my emotional investment was larger in rdr2. But time period doesn't really matter.
Limbo,"Thanks for the reply. Just wanted to make sure. Actually, I heard and experienced issues with modding, especially with Bethesda games in Epic Games Store. And in general have heard people saying that Epic store is pretty bad if someone wants to play with mods. Modding for me is one of the main and most fun things (especially in games like Skyrim) so sometimes no excess to mods can be a huge deal breaker for me."
Limbo,"""10 minute animation. 45 minute animation"". Yeah sure  that's real valid isn't it lol. Someone being overly negative and blowing something out of proportion is considered to be pessimistic to me. I never said he was wrong and couldn't have an opinion. I just called him a debby downer. I'm entitled to my opinion as well right?"
Limbo,"Hey, what didn’t you like about the side content? I guess hunting is kinda barebones"
Limbo,"Rivers quest was so boring. Go here, fetch this. Fetch that. Search the nephews room for clues. Snooze fest. It was nothing I haven’t seen before a million times. Most of the side quests were boring as hell. There were some cool moments, but thought provoking? Nah."
Limbo,"Don't care, didn't read; get more interesting and stop leaning on sarcasm as a crutch for your lack of personality."
Limbo,Continue with your non contributions. Op asked which game and here you are just wasting thread space
Limbo,If you want to rant about how terrible RDR2 is make your own post
Limbo,"Your making comments on someone’s character over a game, if anything you’re a Debby downer"
Limbo,"Some of the sidequests were kinda stupid and unsatisfying. The one that stuck in my mind the most was the one where you encounter that woman who takes advantage of two guys with disabilities and the ark of the story is that the guys don't want to be with her because she's an absolutely horrible, abusive human being. Then when you find them they realise that they're still gonna go with her. 

Like what's the point? I had no input, the ark of the characters was to learn to put up with an abuser and it took like 20 minutes. 

&#x200B;

Not to say that I encountered no good sidequests. The one where you help a woman learn to live in the forest was lovely. But the game to me was littered with moments that ended in an unsatisfying anticlimax."
Limbo,"Very interesting. What did you think of >!
Jackies funeral? !<"
Limbo,"That comes from the guy that screeched and had a complete meltdown when someone else dared ask which kind of depth RDR2 had, because how dare he not know your favourite video game.

There is 0 irony in my last comment, btw! Not that I would expect you to understand irony…

Lmfao, reddit basement-dweller moment."
Limbo,"What’s YOUR contribution, lad? What’s your purpose? Why are you commenting?

As I said above, I explained why I thought neither of the games were particularly good in my opinion. That’s highly relèvent on a sub where people ask whether they should buy specific games.

My comment is on topic. Yours aren’t and are just useless attacks with 0 contribution on the actual subject. Are you perhaps an alt of the other guy? That’s the o my way this would make sense, tbh. You’re weird"
Limbo,"Ranting? For a whole 2 lines? Do you even know what a rant is? Open a dictionary ffs

The guy above had a meltdown when someone asked a simple question, I pointed out to him that no everyone necessarily liked every game or knew everything about every game.

That’s highly relevant to the conversation.

Once again, what is YOUR contribution here, apart from attacking me for no reason?"
Limbo,You're making comments about my character over a reddit post. A bit hypocritical.
Limbo,"Well, I didn't realize they had disabilities. Maybe I'm just stupid. I'm guessing your talking about the one where you had to keep punching and kicking those guys to prove which one was stronger? 

I saw it as funny, and I never saw them go back to her, I don't think I ever saw them after their final mission.  


Maybe I just didn't find them or I'm stupid. Oh well, I enjoyed those missions, and yeah that one with charlotte (woman in forest) was great."
Limbo,Getting his bike was the best part
Limbo,"No, you were in fact, weird because no one cares what you don’t like. I was genuinely interested in seeing how much people loved one game over the other but here you are."
Limbo,I already gave my contribution
Limbo,"My contribution was that I love both games but I feel like RDR two gets the one here because not only is it one of the greatest games of all time, but the story is pretty impactful"
Limbo,My context might seem illiterate because I am using voice to text
Limbo,"I think we're talking about another quest.  I googled it, it's called ""the smell of grease paint""."
Limbo,"Intruiging. I absolutely love that quest for how real it feels. 
>! How it takes the time to mourn and speak to the people that this affected. Presenting a death so realistically gave so much validity to the rest of the world. It made me remember times I've lost people. 
Death in video games is never presented like this. !<"
Limbo,"That sounds like a you issue, tbh

- Some people love one game more than the other

- some people prefer the other one

- some people like neither of them

These are all valid opinions on the exact same subject. I’m in the third camp, for reasons that I explained. I would therefore recommend OP to buy neither of these games if the reasons I gave resonate with him.

It’s hilarious that you don’t see that my comment is very much on topic for this thread - logic isn’t your forte, huh"
Limbo,"Clearly not in this chain of comment, which is why I’m asking you what you’re even doing here."
Limbo,"Fair enough! That’s understandable.

My contribution was that I didn’t like either of them for the reason stated above (gameplay isn’t interesting or skill-based enough, and that’s what matters most in games in my opinion), and therefore wouldn’t recommend either of them.

Don’t you see how my opinion is just as valid as yours? Again, why are you commenting here?"
Superhot VR,"Bone works has more content and is easily more innovative to play. Superhot is cool, but Boneworks has a great story and much more depth in combat and gameplay, with puzzles as well. I’d recommend Boneworks over Superhot."
Superhot VR,boneworks
Superhot VR,SUPER. HOT. Superhot is the most innovative shooter I’ve played in years!
Superhot VR,I dont really know boneworks but I've played a lot of superhot and I super like it. It adds a whole new element with the time only moves when you move. It feels like you are in the matrix dodging bullets and shit
Superhot VR,Bonework. It is the most realistic vr game and it's incredibly fun
Superhot VR,I’ve been following Boneworks since early development and it makes superhot look like it was made on MS paint. Boneworks is the future of VR
Superhot VR,SUPERHOT is the most innovative shooter I've played in years!
Superhot VR,Boneworks for reasons already sated by the others
Superhot VR,SUPERHOT all day
Superhot VR,super...hot...super...hot...super...hot
Superhot VR,How long is the game?  In both terms of your first run through and replayability?
Superhot VR,It is truly the most innovative shooter
Superhot VR,"Both have great replayability. IIRC boneworks is a little longer than superhot is, but neither are super long games. The physics and hidden shit in Boneworks makes it much more replayable than Superhot tho"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,what is gained by getting the achievements?
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Pleasure.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"i’ve just never heard of that, is it for the sake of getting the number of achievements on your profile higher??"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,Both.It adds a challenge to the game and the music you hear when you complete a game is extremely satisfying.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"right on man, happy achievement hunting to you"
Amnesia: The Dark Descent,"Thanks,kind stranger."
Hyper Light Drifter,I'm pretty bad at games and i got trough it fine. The game is prety liberal with checkpoints
Hyper Light Drifter,"I hate games like this, but boy, I loved this game.  It also has one of the best soundtracks ever."
Hyper Light Drifter,"Definitely an influential indie game and worth a play. There are upgrades you can buy along the way to make combat easier for yourself. It's entirely non-verbal however. The music and atmosphere and occasional images tell the story.

FWIW I have never ever enjoyed the Zelda formula but I really liked Hyper Light Drifter and similarly I'm currently really enjoying Tunic. I'd say Hyper Light Drifter and Tunic are similar in some ways, so maybe put that on your radar too."
Hyper Light Drifter,"I loved the game it reminds me of old school zelda kinda like link to the past.  I wouldn't say the game is difficult like dark souls or Returnal but it can be challenging.  I feel like the biggest difficulty was figuring out where to go next, it's like a where the fuck do I go kinda game. 8/10"
Hyper Light Drifter,"TL;DR = I highly recommend it!

* Is it difficult?
   * Yes, but not frustratingly so. Combat is meant to challenging and there's definitely a learning curve, but there's no penalty for dying and checkpoints are forgiving. With a small bit of trail and error and some patience for exploration, you'll make steady progress.
* Story?
   * Any info about setting, characters, plot, or history is told through the environments or occasional 3-image-long monologues by NPC's. It's light, but compelling.

It's worth playing for the atmosphere alone. The crunchy pixel art and vibrant color palettes mix with the synth-heavy soundtrack by Disasterpeace to create a constant sense of melancholic wonder. 

Enjoy!"
Hyper Light Drifter,"This game can be hard but it doesn't have to be. I first played it in its easiest mode Newcomer, because I want to experience games and don't like hard games. Some achievements weren't available in that mode and I liked the game so much I had to immediately play through it again in standard mode. Then, still wanting more, I played through again in new game alt mode with the alt drifter, and she's fun! Finally, I tried the hardest mode, new game +. I haven't beaten the game in this mode, but I probably will try to again. This game is great."
Hyper Light Drifter,Yes. I really enjoyed the game. Good combat and great ambience. It’s not perfect but it’s really good.
Hyper Light Drifter,"Ohh the atmosphere in this game...

Yeah it's not especially hard.

Next one after this: Hollow Knight"
Hyper Light Drifter,"You'll be fine, just embrace the dodge."
Hyper Light Drifter,It’s really frustrating to figure out where to go. I found that aspect of the game far more annoying than in any Souls game or Hollow Knight. The combat just wasn’t good enough to make up for how frustrating the exploration was.
Hyper Light Drifter,I would compare it to the souls series.  It has a story but u have to figure it out.  Spoiler free... U crash land on a planet and the adventure begins with hints of some catastrophe that maybe u can prevent.  If the game is cheap you should definitely get it.
Hyper Light Drifter,okay thanks!!
Hyper Light Drifter,i’ll check Tunic out also! thanks!!
Hyper Light Drifter,Have you tried deaths door? That game was boring but I’m curious about hyper light drifter and tunic
Hyper Light Drifter,ohh i’ll look out for that!! how would you say the story is? is it engaging?
Hyper Light Drifter,"Haven't yet, but I often see people comparing Death's Door and Tunic. You say you didn't like it, but I've seen others say they preferred it to Tunic. Sorry, I can't be much more help."
Hyper Light Drifter,Death’s Door was awesome
Hyper Light Drifter,"The story is kinda open to interpretation. There's no text or dialog. Just images you kinda piece together yourself. It's a very minimal story, but I'm sure there's a wiki or youtube videos out there that will explain what's going on."
Hyper Light Drifter,"Also, don't worry about trying to figure out where to go. No idea what the people saying that in these comments are on about, because there are four main paths and you can literally go through them in any order. There is no wrong way to go."
Hyper Light Drifter,"Agree there is no wrong way to go. However, like Megaman, there's an intended order which makes getting through the game easier. The first section I visited was pretty challenging and the boss was a perfect conclusion to that. The second section I visited  was a walk in the park and I completely crushed the boss. The other two sections were more challenging, but neither as challenging as the first."
Hyper Light Drifter,"I stopped playing it because I got stuck early on, not knowing where to go and not feeling like finding a youtube video to explain what I should be doing.

It's in now in the largest category of my steam games, which is ""played less than an hour and probably will never play again"""
Just Shapes & Beats,"It's really good. The problem is that it's relativity short for 20$ but it's repayable of course, and outside the main story there are extra unlockable levels.

It depends if you care that the experience of the main story will only last 5-8 hours."
OxenFree,"It’s good but it’s not like any of those games, it’s very story based"
OxenFree,"I personally enjoyed it a lot, but it’s a point & click game so it’s nothing like the games you listed. If gameplay is a higher priority than story for you, then I’d wait for a sale."
OxenFree,wait for it to go on sale since it goes for very cheap also I have heard good things about it but if u don't want to read a lot then it might not be for you
OxenFree,It's a great story based adventure. I personally love the artwork as well. I've recommended it before.
OxenFree,"It’s a great little game, however it has absolutely nothing in common with the games you mentioned"
Abzu,If you can get it for 5-10 bucks it’s a good game to experience at least once. Very visually striking and an honestly relaxing play through hahaha.
Abzu,If you haven't played subnautica and want a slight mindless relaxing 1 time experience then yes if not I would pass
Abzu,It’s a pretty short play through.  But I absolutely loved it.  It has an amazing art style and there is a very thin story that I found enjoyable.  I’d give it a shot
Abzu,"Yes, you absolutely should! If you are able to I also recommend you playing it in one sitting (it’s not very long). I wish I could go back and play that for the first time again, but sadly that’s impossible."
Abzu,"It's absolutely beautiful. I was enchanted and felt this sense of suspense the whole time. I was terrified at times and was crying by the end; it's really quite the journey, and no one should miss out on it!"
Abzu,"If it's cheap (which it should be) you should definitely play it. The visuals are gorgeous, the music is beautiful, and it handles really well for taking place completely underwater. This game is an experience, so if you're looking for engaging gameplay give it a pass. That being said, I loved Abzu. I liked it better than Journey."
Soma,"Yes, it's a great horror game. Great story and great atmosphere."
Soma,"It is very, very good. And terrifying. But not in the cheap, jump scare, 5 nights at Freddy's kind of way. More like constant anxiety wondering what's behind that corner. The story is very good, really effective at filling you with deep existential dread."
Soma,"In case you needed more assurance, I'm adding another ""yes""! I just beat it a month ago myself. Very scary, but I'm also just a wuss with horror games. It has a really compelling narrative though, so it's well worth it even then.

Definitely check it out!"
Soma,yes.  it's not very scary compared to other horror games nowadays but the story is great.
Soma,Thanks!
Kentucky Route Zero,"I've played the first two. They are pretty much walking sims, if there are puzzles those are minimal and super easy. I like both of them but NITW has a special place in my heart, imo it was a very heartwarming game, which I'm a sucker for. There are also two free supplemental games for NITW (google 'em, one of them is a short but really worth it full game quality game). Kentucky is also very good while being more adult (not porn or anything, it's just more grounded and the story is aimed at a older audience)."
Kentucky Route Zero,"I've only played Kentucky and Edith Finch, and I definitely preferred Kentucky. The atmosphere is amazing and there are so many moments that you can get lost in the sound design and beautiful art style. Edith Finch is really good too, but a bit shorter and more grounded."
Kentucky Route Zero,"Edith Finch is pure art that you can shove down any mouth that would for some reason say in 2020 that games can’t be one.

I haven’t played Kentucky yet, but from what i hear all three deserve your attention. But having loved unfinished swan you might want to start with Finch as it is their bigger budget follow up on the success of one of your favourite games."
Kentucky Route Zero,Get what remains of edith finch. I never play story games but I decided to give it a try. Immediately loved it and got invested into it. Im buying it again for PS4 I loved it so much. Played it in one sitting and I completely and utterly love the game.
Kentucky Route Zero,NIGHT IN THE WOODS HOLY SHIT ITS GOOD
Braid,RDR2 is an absolute triumph. It MUST be played.
Braid,"I would generally recommend RDR2, which is one of the best games ever made.

Presentation is absolutely stunning across the board. Graphics, SFX, music, voice acting, all are absolutely stellar.

Gameplay-wise is also phenomenal. Essentially, to summarise, it plays as a 3rd-person shooter, with some RPG and simulation elements - it really shines in making you *feel* like the character you're playing as, that is, a cowboy in the late 19th/early 20th century, with all the gambling, outlawing, hunting, etc.

The content available is frankly some of the best value in any videogame. This is the most well-realised open-world game ever, in my estimation - an immersive world that feels natural and alive, that exists independently of you but reacts to your decisions. The story is fully fleshed out, dramatic, personal and intimate, but also self-aware enough to shine all the wild west tropes through. You have further an entire online mode that I haven't even touched yet.

When considering the preferences you laid out, I'm even more convinced you'll enjoy it. I'd recommend it over cyberpunk to anyone, but even more to someone with your preferences."
Braid,"RDR2 is probably the better made game but I also loved Cyberpunk, it’s story, and it felt very creative and new. I liked someone else’s idea of doing RDR2 and buy Cyberpunk when DLC comes out so you can transition straight to DLC"
Braid,"Love both, but I’d start with RDR2 buddy. And just know, it’ll be awhile before you start Cyberpunk once you get immersed into that work and Aruthur"
Braid,U can miss cyberpunk. U cant pass on RDR2! Easy as that
Braid,"Rdr2 without a doubt. The most beautiful open world, lots of chill out time, lots of random and very well written scripted quests, a sense of history with a bit of the absurd, and a tragic crime family story. It will give you a thrill, make you feel like a badass, and then leave you in tears."
Braid,"I’m sure there will be a Complete Edition for Cyberpunk/Phantom Liberty, so wait on that. Cyberpunk was great; loved the story, Night City and the RPG elements. Granted I played on PS5 when that version was released. 

Red Dead Redemption II is one of the greatest games ever made. Five years later and it’s still worth full price. The quantity and quality of content is impressive."
Braid,RDR2
Braid,"As someone that was super hyped cyberpunk and hit it day 1, as faulty and buggy as it was at the time on my ps4, I enjoyed it, and now 100 times better with the next gen update and all on my ps5, that being said, RDR2 was one of the best games of the last generation, and it plays great on next gen consoles… definitely recommend RDR2, it’s not an rpg but getting lost in that world and along with the things you discover in it are very rpg like to me, definitely recommend RDR2"
Braid,"RDR2.

Cyberpunk is cool, but it will be much cooler in a few months with the update/remake

I also would only get cyberpunk if you have at least a PS5/next gen/pc"
Braid,Red dead redemption until cyberpunk dlc is released
Braid,"No question, RDR2 all the way!"
Braid,"I feel like RDR2 is a much better overall game, but is more divisive than you would be lead to believe. It's a slow burn story game, so if you're cool with that, it's way better.

Cyberpunk is exactly as you expect it to look and feel."
Braid,"Cyberpunk base game is also been a lot of improvements when the DLC releases so get cyberpunk then with the DLC, for now its time for RDR2 Boah!!"
Braid,RDR2
Braid,RDR2 without a doubt
Braid,"Red dead, even though I mostly play rpgs. Even though it’s fairly polished now I just find Cyberpunk to be boring. Idk I hope someday I can engage with it but it’s not now."
Braid,"RDR2

Cyberpunk is also a very good game, and I do recommend you play it eventually

But with the DLC just around the corner (only three months away in fact) you should wait until it releases before getting it"
Braid,"Wait for the DLC and play RDR2 while you wait. I personally liked Cyberpunk more, but RDR2 is amazing aswell."
Braid,"Rdr2 and I liked both of them, but RDR2 is on another level"
Braid,Rdr2
Braid,"RDR2 is the most polished game I have ever played. The environments are highly-interactive and the world with it’s animals and people respond to you and each other in a very believable way. It’s story is an engaging epic action-drama grounded in reality. It’s extremely immersive.

CP2077 had very rough beginnings and, when I last played it late last year, that roughness still shows through on what otherwise feels like quite a nice game. Everyone knows about the bugs, so there’s no point mentioning them more here.  The physical environments and sound design are very well set up. But the NPCs populating the world will behave in ways that might break your immersion. When a gun is fired, they will all crouch in the same animation and despawn as soon as you aren’t looking. Police will spawn in on top of you when you commit a crime and don’t put up any chase when you flee. Feels disappointing in a world constructed around the notion of constant police-gang struggle. Supposedly this is slated to be reworked in the future.
The world has some interactivity more on par with games like dishonored 2. Dialogue feels particularly strong and the story is, in my experience, engaging. 
One strange thing is the character customisation. One premise of the world building is ‘fashion over function’. How you look is supposedly as important as how you act on the world of 2077. But this is totally at odds with the actual game mechanics. You will be heavily encouraged to wear clothes for their stats, not their appearance, and that will lead to some pretty weird costume combos. It doesn’t matter much because the game is entirely first person perspective, but that begs the (controversial?) question of why have a player model at all."
Braid,Yes red dead redemption is much better on many levels right off the bat.
Braid,Rdr2
Braid,"Rdr2 100%. In my opinion it’s the best/most realistic video game ever made. The only downside is it’s ruined every game I’ve played after it. Either the graphics look terrible, the story is dumb, gaming mechanics aren’t as good etc.."
Braid,"Hands down, RDR2. While I enjoyed Cyberpunk for what it is, I don't think that's a close call by almost any metric."
Braid,"Red Dead Redemption 2 by far; I 100% Cyberpunk 2077, I did not 100% Red Dead.  Cyberpunk doesn't not have a lot of depth, unfortunately, its presentation is good and certainly has gotten better since launch but literally the only time I would even talk about it in the same breath as RDR2 is a question like yours, in terms of quality and depth and content, it doesn't hold a candle to RDR2.

There is of course a difference in setting to consider, but just keep in mind that while the 'cyberpunk' aesthetic is certainly present in Cyberpunk 2077, I'd argue it doesn't even do it as well as games like Shadowrun for SNES or Shadowrun for Genesis.  That may seem harsh, but again I did everything you could do in this game, it really doesn't have much going for it."
Braid,RDR2
Braid,"I would wait for the the dlc for Cyberpunk as it seems it will be some kind of mega side quest and will bring improvements to the base game as well, rdr2 is hit or miss I guess depending on people, it's a slow paced game but amazing visuals, story and immersion but with that said I finished cyberpunk and still will come back for the dlc, the game has a pretty big replayability if you like trying different approach to combat"
Braid,"If you don't mind a slow burn for massive payoff then go for RDR2. You'll want to wait to play CP2077 until Phantom Liberty releases as they're doing an overhaul of the base game too.

Edit: Liberty not Pain"
Braid,RDR2
Braid,"No, it's not Next-Gen Optimized, but still RDR2 all day every day"
Braid,"RDR2 is the superior game in my opinion. Cyberpunk is pretty bland in comparison. However, Cyberpunk has better performance in that, it can run at 60 fps on next- gen consoles (whereas RDR2 is locked at 30 fps) and is better optimized on PC, though still expect bugs. Also, RDR2 can be overwhelming with its size and detail, Cyberpunk is much smaller in scale."
Braid,RDR 2 if you like a beautiful masterpiece
Braid,"I just started RD2 on PC about a week ago and it’s absolutely sensational.

I do plan on getting CP after the new DLC comes out tho, and after I finish the main story in RD2!"
Braid,You like computers or cowboys?
Braid,"Seems like they’re going to add lots of fixes to the new gen consoles version of cyberpunk along with the expansion, so I think you should play RDR2 until a much better version of cyberpunk is out."
Braid,RDR2.
Braid,Red Dead Redemption 2
Braid,"Wait for the Dlc of Cyberpunk, the game will get a massive overhaul with it"
Braid,"RDR2 is the most polished game I have ever played. The environments are highly-interactive and the world with it’s animals and people respond to you and each other in a very believable way. It’s story is an engaging epic action-drama grounded in reality. It’s extremely immersive.

Braid,Red Dead 2
Braid,RDR2 duh. CP2077 world and setting is unlike anything I've seen before so that's why I liked it but the story and gameplay was just ok to me.
Braid,"RD2 

Wait for cyberpunks expansion and then get it. It’s a good game on its own. Think Skyrim but in a cyberpunk setting. Yes is failed on some major systems they were supposed to have. Supposedly they are reworking a ton which will drop with the new expansion in September"
Braid,Red Dead. Definitely Red Dead.
Braid,RDR 2 hands down!
Braid,rdr2 for sure!
Braid,Rdr2
Braid,"I might get some hate, but i enjoyed cyberpunk way more than i did rdr2. Maybe rdr2 was too tedious for me, or i didnt like the setting so much. Not sure, still a masterpiece though. 
Still id get cp2077"
Braid,Red Dead Redemption 2
Braid,RDR2. By a mile!
Braid,"There has recently (as in, this weekend) been an article about the Cyberpunk DLC. Along side it is an overall of almost every system. The state its in now, Cyberpunk is *fine.* The open world feels so dead and empty, with nothing ever changing. You can stand and watch a NPC for 5 hours, and they will not move from there spot. The gunplay is fantastic, and the story is good, although that's of course subjective) I think part of that will be changing, along with the many other little tweaks they will be making, along side adding the DLC. So I would hold off. 

&#x200B;

RDR2, in contrast is amazing. The story, combat, graphics are wonderful and I don't have much bad to say about the game. My only complaint is the pacing of the story. It drags on a little to much, but at the same time, that's kind of the point? So It seems a weird complaint. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, TL;DR- Buy RDR2, Hold of on Cyberpunk until the DLC is released"
Braid,Red dead 2. That game is forever in my heart
Braid,"If you like RPG games, go for cyberpunk. But if you want an experience go for RDR2. Many people say that rdr2 doesn’t have a good story, but I believe that it is amazing. But I think everyone will agree that rdr2 has the best protagonist of all time, Arthur Morgan."
Braid,[deleted]
Braid,"It took me almost 70h to complete the main story in RDR2 that is without any side missions or free roaming.

Done the cyberpunk main story a lot of side quests and done some free roaming all under 50h"
Braid,Both are great but I'd wait for Cyberpunk fixes and qol that come with the expansion so RDR2 first
Braid,"RDR2 is probably the better made game but I also loved Cyberpunk, it’s story, and it felt very creative and new. I liked someone else’s idea of doing RDR2 and buy Cyberpunk when DLC comes out so you can transition straight to DLC"
Braid,"I completed cyberpunk 3x with lowered graphics and shit fps. (Roll on phantom liberty with a 3080)

I didnt finish RDR2s first? Second? Act.

Dont get me wrong, I think RDR2 is an amazing game, probably the better one, but these are the facts lol."
Braid,Rdr2.  Then In September you can get CP when it gets somewhat overhauled by developers
Braid,Why is that even a question? RDR2 should be the default answer to this.
Braid,Get both honestly. They are both masterpieces of games. I personally enjoy Cyberpunk a lot more but they are both fantastic in terms of story and gameplay.
Braid,Cp 2077
Braid,"I'd go with RDR2 first and, depending on how much free time you have, by the time you're done with it there'll probably be some version of Cyberpunk with Phantom Liberty included. Either way you'll have a great time with both, enjoy!"
Braid,"I admit that rdr2 is the better made game,  I just got bored by it.  Cyberpunk was way more fun and engaging to me. I played on a pretty good pc, and didn't really have any expectations going into the game,  so I wasn't soured by anything.

Rockstar games kinda just bore me tbh. After playing the ps2 gta games to death,  any Rockstar game after just feels like it plays the exact same."
Braid,I love Cyberpunk and never had bug issues. You should 100% get red dead as it’s probably the best game ever created.
Braid,Red Dead Redemption 2 is already a complete game. Cyberpunk still needs polishing and should be even more solid after the expansion comes out in September. RDR2 will hold you until then.
Braid,"if u have a series console, ps5, or high end pc, get cyberpunk for 30$ plus the expansion for another 30$. if u don't have that, then id say RDR2"
Braid,"Have both and played both.  
RDR2 is super immersive and so finely tuned - but it is an open world Rockstar game so it's going to be a bit overwhelming, at least it was to me.  
Cyberpunk is also open world but a bit more linear.  It has that Skyrim like maneuverability where things can get wonky but it allows the player more freedom. 

I'd say go for cyberpunk and just play it now so you have an understanding of the game and story before the dlc comes out."
Braid,"I have both.

Cyberpunk is more of RPG style than RDR2. There's skill points and such to distribute. RDR2 increases stats for you based on what you do.

Cyberpunk's AI have health bars, red dead's doesn't. It's more immersive for that reason.

RDR2 is much slower pace, but has a lot more to explore. The scenery can be breath-taking and sometimes hard to fathom how good it looks. 

Cyberpunk has a lot of nothing, but it still looks pretty cool. Nice graphics.

So far, I like cyberpunk's story but it can seem a bit all over the place.

RDR2 has been easier to follow."
Braid,"If you just want a decent story with an immersive world and nice graphics, RDR2 is fine for that. It has pretty terrible gameplay, and it's a brain-dead easy game that treats players like they have 60 IQ. If you just want to turn off your brain for 60-hours and play through a decent story, then it fits the bill. Especially if you like the wild west and spaghetti western movies, then you will probably like RDR2. 

Cyberpunk has way better art direction than RDR2, but the game is severely lacking in terms of a lot of its open world systems. It has nowhere near as immersive of an open world as RDR2. The setting and visuals are a lot cooler, but the actual execution isn't there. The combat is not very good, but it's at least better than RDR2 in this area. It also has RPG systems and build variety which RDR2 doesn't have. Overall I'd say just wait until the DLC drops, because apparently they have reworked a lot of aspects of the game. CP2077 really does have a lot of potential, so if the DLC lives up to the hype, then it could be a game changer."
Braid,I just tried cyberpunk a couple weeks ago off a freinds familyshare and its still super buggy to the point where i wound up getting fed up with the bugs and uninstalling. I would have felt very cheated if it was a game i payed for. So i would go with RDR2
Braid,"Everyone says RDR2 is the best game ever, but the janky controls are super frustrating and honestly it’s pretty slow at times. I don’t need to watch long animations every time I pick something up or do anything. It’s more cowboy sim than game. 

Tried it 3 times and never make it past 10 hrs or so."
Braid,[deleted]
Braid,Both
Braid,Mount a blade bannerlord has great rpg mechanics you can literally be anything in that world
Braid,I would only choose Cyberpunk solely because it has next gen support. RDR2 is a fantastic game but lacks that kind of support which makes me personally not touch it ever since I beat it back in 2018.
Braid,"RDR2. It’s a much more immersive game and story. Cyberpunk is a great game too, but I don’t find the story as good at all. The pros about cyberpunk are extreme weapon customization and playstyle customization with perk trees. When I play RDR2 I feel like I’m in the story, and when I play Cyberpunk I feel like I’m in a gigantic beautiful sandbox game."
Braid,Cyberpunk
Braid,"RDR2 is much more story rich and interactive compared to cyberpunk. It only takes around 30 hours to complete the main mission, spoiler alert ( when doing the last mission after doing so you get back to prior of starting the last mission to finish anything else to basically you don't fully finish it). It has nice features, ray tracing, and a nice environment, but RDR2 beats it in every other way. That's from my opinion as i have both and played both for 100 hours plus on each."
Braid,"Cyberpunk has better writing and combat. Rdr2's world is more detailed, alive and polished. 
I prefer cyberpunk.
Most people seem to prefer rdr2."
Braid,"RDR2. Ive played both and Cyberpunk really lacks in a lot of areas and i didn’t get much enjoyment from it after completing the main story line. RDR2 however is a game that ive replayed numerous times and spent upwards of 400 hours combined playing, most of it in free roam. Havent even touched the online yet."
Braid,"Cyberpunk's DLC will remain as a DLC, it seems to be set in a new city, but at this point, nothing can be done about the game's dullness and how unfun it is to play. I played it for 25 hours(right until the 3-race side mission were unlocked), and it's just boring, the plot is mediocre, the fighting, the gameplay are subpar, the only redeeming thing was how beautiful everything looked, and that's it"
Braid,I would be cautious with RDR2 on PC. I had to get a refund on it due to the game constantly crashing; the issues had to do specifically with the Rockstar games launcher which you are required to use.
Braid,"Rdr2 is a bit of an ancient game in terms of design. Missions force you to do things one way and if you don’t listen the game fails you. It’s also an aggressively easy game that just feels stiff and clunky mechanics wise. It’s got great voice acting, but I found the world and story pretty dull. Cyberpunk is a far more enjoyable game that gives you choices on how to handle each mission with much better combat and a much more interesting world to explore and a far more interesting story."
Braid,"This is a hard one, gotta do both haha"
Braid,neither buy rain world 😈😈
Braid,RDR2 no contest
Braid,"Depends, if you're on console I would skip RDR2, it still runs at 30FPS, rockstar doesn't care about next gen update."
Braid,"Neither, buy doom eternal"
Braid,I dont like rdr2 at all and like project red games
Braid,Cyberpunk. Red dead 2 is overrated imo
Braid,They’re both great go with what interests you more.
Braid,I've played both and I have some stronger critiques on RD2 than most but would still pick it over CP.
Braid,"Both games are amazing, i loved Cyberpunk it's story characters, scenery. currently playing RDR2 its really good, both games are great. I'd buy both if i were u"
Braid,Robots and guns or cowboys and guns
Braid,"I’d go for Cyberpunk personally. The game is really good as long as you take your time and do the side quests. There are a ton of really compelling stories that get told. I’d wait to play until Phantom Liberty releases though. The gameplay is already good, but it’s rumored they’re going to be shipping big improvements to key systems like the AI and the police systems (and possibly more) with the DLC."
Braid,I recommend getting both
Braid,"Both are incredible story games, depends on what you want. If you care about story and characters, go red dead, if you care about combat and replay ability go cyberpunk"
Braid,"Rdr2, 100000%"
Braid,Cyberpunk if you want action. Red dead if you don't mind watching a movie in game format.
Braid,Rdr2 cyberpunk has a lot of problems
Braid,RDR2
Braid,Red dead partner!
Braid,Red Dead is the better game hands down.
Braid,RDR2
Braid,Do you want to be a cowboy? If so…follow your heart
Braid,Cyberpunk has a big DLC coming soon.
Braid,"With the Phantom Liberty expansion, which overhaul all of cyberpunk. It will great to buy...


But RDR2 is a moderm masterpiece so it gets my vote"
Braid,"Cyberpunk is more action and adrenaline, Red Dead Redemption 2 is more laid back and slow-paced.  


Cyberpunk has been getting updates continually since release and is awesomely upgraded by this point...I never finished RDR2, but I finished Cyberpunk and am waiting at the edge of my seat for Phantom Liberty, which is going to be a *huge* DLC and should be later this year.  


Cyberpunk.  My two cents."
Braid,"RDR2, it's much more detailed and alive rather than cyberprank, tho I enjoyed cyberprank (played from friend's console) its just not within the same level of RDR2 also the balancing of story telling and action on RDR2 is peak unlike in cyberpunk you're always just sitting and listening"
Braid,I don’t usually post on reddit but i just want to make sure that you get RDR2
Braid,"Both are great, but I think Cyberpunk is the more engaging game. Red Dead suffers from the antiquated Rockstar game design. Almost no freedom during missions, you’re just railroaded through each section and must play it as the developers intend."
Braid,Red dead 2 is my pick. Cyberpunk was fun but i can’t just sit back and enjoy the world like i can with RDr2
Braid,"In my opinion, Red Dead Redemption 2 was an incredible experience, especially in the beginning and middle game. However, I found myself getting bored after reaching around 60% completion, as there weren't many new things to explore once I had acquired the best weapon. 

On the other hand, Cyberpunk had superior writing and enjoyable gameplay, but it did suffer from some noticeable bugs."
Braid,"RDR2 and anyone who says diff is crazy ive completed both games and theres just nothing that compares to RDR2 everything about it is so amazing but for me my fav thing about the game was the story telling. the best storytelling ive ever experienced in a game hands down. it could of been a oscar winning film. i literally cryed during a few scenarios in the game,"
Braid,Lol EASY choice. RDR2.
Braid,Are you on pc ? If you don’t wanna keep the games forever. I can tell you how to get them for like 2$ both on steam
Braid,"I vote rdr, as well. BUT, if you haven't played Witcher 3, that's another great one. Plus, it often heavily discounted."
Braid,RDR2 and its not even close
Braid,"Red dead 2. There isn’t a game that has immersed me more than this game, I play butt nekkid and pretend I’m a O’Driscol. 10 Cowboys out of 10"
Braid,"I’ve played both and loved both, but I fully believe that RDR2 is truly the best game ever, go with that first!"
Braid,"Rdr2 is very pretty and has some interesting things in it but from a gameplay perspective it's unbelievably barren. You don't even get to aim your gun in this game really and all the missions are basically ""walk here, listen to dialogue, kill guys"".

Cyberpunk at least has some depth to combat. It's a passable first person shooter. Not a great one mind you, but it works. The missions here are also just ""walk here, listen to dialogue, kill guys"".

Personally the dialogue in both these games puts me to sleep and that's like 70% of both. But I guess I would say the Rdr2 dialogue at least feels finished, whereas the cyberpunk dialogue very frequently feels like a placeholder."
Braid,RDR 2 is a no brainer in this case
Braid,"Cyberpunk over RDR2. While RDR2 is a great game, i found it slow, and alot of the “immersive” mechanics being pretty surface level and just boring. Unpopular take, but Cyberpunk is more fun."
Braid,I’d wait till the new expansion for CP2077 comes out. It’s supposed to bring a whole bunch of QOL changes to the base game.
Braid,RDR2
Braid,No
Braid,"RDR2 was fun, but I was more hyped for Cyberpunk 2077. Ended up not caring for RDR2 so much after burning myself out on it, but Cyberpunk absolutely failed me in almost every department. RDR2 is the way to go."
Braid,"Wait for the cyberpunk dlc to drop before you buy since they are redoing A LOT of the mechanics. I believe it’s September 26 so you have a lot of time to finish red dead. Plus the summer sale is soonish I think so you might be able to get the game and dlc for cheap depending on what price they set. 

I’ve played both and even though it’s been a while since I played cyberpunk and I just finished red dead 3 days ago both are excellent games in their own right but I’d probably play red dead before cyberpunk."
Braid,**\*\*\* me scrolling through the comments to find the crazy psychopath that chooses cyberpunk over rdr2 \*\*\***
Braid,Cyberpunk is fun but it doesn’t come close to RDR2.
Braid,"It depends on what type of games you like, red dead is more story based and polished, but cyberpunk is more ""fuck around and break the game"", but in a good way

Cyberpunk has leveling and a skill tree, and rdr doesn't, so I think you'd like it more

Also red dead was built with miracles or something because it runs like a dream"
Braid,[removed]
Braid,Both games are really good but RDR2 is my favourite game all time so pick RDR2
Braid,"Both are great, but RDR2 is looong but with lots of content"
Braid,Rdr2
Braid,Cyberpunk is more fun. RDR2 gets crazy tedious
Braid,"Red Dead 2 is worth its weight in gold. The story is perfectly told, with some of the best voice acting I've ever heard in a video game. The world is vast, and you never feel like you're completely out of things to do. Bored of missions? Hunt some animals for upgrades to both your player or your camp. Tired of hunting? Put your criminal mind to robbing a store or train. Want to help the law? Check the local sheriff's office for a bounty. The list of activities goes on and on...


So to answer your question, take a break from the cybernetics and neon signs of Night City and go on a breathtaking journey through late 1800's America with Dutch Van der Linde and the gang!"
Braid,"Go with red dead and play cyberpunk after the last dlc comes out. There will probably some sale for a definitive edition down the line.

Both games are definitely worth to be played."
Braid,Do you prefer cowboys or cyborgs
Braid,Finished Rdr2 3 times already and would pay 200$to forget everything and start the game again without remembering anything. Cyberpunk I enjoyed the story but the game was full of bugs and lost the interest of playing it again even if it is fixed or not
Braid,"I played red dead 2 after it had been out for like 4 years not expecting much. I didn't even buy it, I played my brothers copy, that's the only reason I tried it. It turned out to be my favorite game ever. I'm not particularly interested in the wild west. It felt like watching a movie in the best way possible. It's the only game I can think of where I was sad because I knew it was ending soon. I can't recommend it enough.

I was excited for cyberpunk for years. I was incredibly disappointed when I finally was able to play it, I put about 20 hours in it and feel no urge to continue playing it. Even after they've patched it."
Braid,"All you need to do is listen to the song ""Video games"" by Tenacious D. You're welcome."
Braid,RDR2. Cyberpunk's getting totally reworked head to toe alongside new DLC in September and *that's* when you should buy it.
Braid,RDR2
Braid,rdr2
Braid,RDR2!
Braid,Hmph. Rdr2 is a masterpiece. Cyberpunk quite literally is bad. Phantom liberty sounds very promising on paper but we’ll have to see. So did this game pre release and I’d give it a 5/10.
Braid,Is this post by OP a joke?
Braid,RDR2
Braid,"Rdr2 has a much stronger plot and cast. And the world is gorgeous.

Cyberpunk is also fantastic and a lot of fun, BUT it’s a lot more you having to role play the character"
Braid,"Loved both, but like everyone has already said, start with RDR2. CP2077 is a fantastic game, but it will get better once the Phantom Liberty update comes out."
Braid,Rdr2 all day. By far my fav game all time.. online sux d tho.
Braid,I couldn't get into RDR2 personally. I was enjoying the story and it's the most beautiful game ever made but I thought the gameplay and controls were so rudimentary I stopped at Chapter 3. Meanwhile I really liked Cyberpunk especially the story and although its gameplay isn't groundbreaking it didn't stop me from finishing the game.
Braid,"Red dead, no doubt."
Braid,RDR2 is one of the best games humanity has ever witnessed
Braid,"Most people are saying RD2, but my vote is for Cyberpunk. Bugs aren't as bad now, and the story is great. Along with a bunch of different builds. You can be a ninja with a katana, a run and gun madman, or a tech savvy hacker. The atmosphere is great and helps tie everything together, and the characters you meet really make it amazing. Just like all of CDPR's games, they really go all out with side quests and side story characters. Plus, Phantom Liberty releases in September, so if it's on sale, I would go for it. Cyberpunk is by far one of my favorites, and honestly, RD2 doesn't even get close to my top games.
That being said, both Cyberpunk and RD2 are both amazing games. I just lean more towards Cyberpunk."
Braid,"I say pick up Cyberpunk, it might be worthwhile to play the game now, with the original story, before playing Phantom Liberty. As Phantom Liberty is very likely going to come with some new endings, and possibly some other changes outside the ones we already know.

Plus I just think its a good game, well worth the money nowadays after 1.5. Mods make it even more fun to play around with. Just an entertaining experience.

On top of that Cyberpunk is truly an RPG, it lets you choose your skills, pick different perks, use different weapons. You truly build your character the way you want. Its very similar to thinks likeSkyrim in that way. Where as Red Dead 2 is just the same character no matter what, there is no leveling system or anything. Its really more of an action adventure title than a true RPG. 

So if you want to get immersed into an RPG and its setting, in similar fashion to things like Skyrim, I recommend 2077."
Braid,RDR2 with no hesitation and do not read spoilers.
Braid,"Hey unpopular opinion time. I played both.

RDR2 is certainly a marvel. The story is amazing, graphics are second to none, the protagonist is probably the most well flushed out I've ever experienced in a game, and overall the game really is a must play.

....but it's a bit of a drag yeah? It's very slow paced, and I found myself just wanting to play other games from time to time. This isn't really a negative point, and is definitely subjective, but man it can DRAG. 



Cyberpunk (post patches) is a wild ride. The story is a blast, and really kicks. The set pieces are way above what I expected in an open world game. The side quests, as expected from CDPR are just as good, if not better than the main story in many cases. Definitely a case of art direction trumping graphical fidelity. While it doesn't look bad by any stretch... Walking though Chinatown in the middle of the night is a sight to behold. Vibrant neon lighting, crowded streets, some guy getting mugged in an alley, the constant cacophony of people shouting and talking... I haven't felt that level of immersion in a game... Maybe ever.

Yeah it's a bit of a mess. But way better than the sum of its parts. Unfortunately I listened to the online griping, and missed out for longer than necessary, but take from someone who was hesitant, it blew me away.

At the end of the day Cyberpunk is just ***fun***. The shooting is chunky and effective, the driving is arcady but feels good, the plot and characters are fucking bonkers, and there really are just so many ways to play the game.

I played it the first time as a learning curve. A little hacking, a little shotgun, a little melee. It was pure chaos and really felt like I was a newbie in night city trying to climb to the top.

Second time thru and I'm playing full stealth. Feels like a totally different game. I walk in an alley, activate my speed implant, turn invisible, and walk through putting a bullet in everyone's head. Come out the other side, and watch the bodies drop before the cameras ever had a chance to catch me. Suddenly I felt like an elite level assassin that was born and bred in this world.


You can't go wrong either way, but I tip towards CP"
Braid,"cyberpunk, rdr2 is a linear game in an open world setting with the most boring chapter 1 in existence, also everything you do (pointless animation) is so slow and infuriating that you can fall asleep"
Braid,I think rdr2 has more replayability if that matter to you as far as stretching your dollar. I dont find myself excitingly opening cyberpunk. I felt like 1 playthrough was enough to get a big grasp of the game.
Braid,"Rdr2 is a masterpiece. It’s slow paced but if you adapt your speed to it, rather than trying to force it to your speed, it’s fantastic! It is the most alive environment of any game I’ve played. Can interact with just about everything too. And npc’s actually seem like they are more than objects moving around the screen."
Braid,RDR2 is one of the greatest games ever made.
Braid,"I have both. The answer is both. Just get both, play them both for less than two-hours each, and refund the one you don’t want."
Braid,"Unquestionably RDR2 is the better, more fully realized game. 

I think the best question to answer from a prospective standpoint, however, is what is your preferred gaming experience? Do you like 'slow' as a concept? Do you enjoy being diverted from whatever you initially planned doing? If a game world is both fun and immersive, are you happy with killing an hour or two wandering around it and not focusing on story progression? If yes to all of the above, You will love RDR2. If you are very task oriented and want everything to be a quick hit, then RDR2 isn't going to be your cup of tea regardless of its (excellent) level of quality.

That's generally what people mean when they say this game is divisive. The less patient get frustrated with its deliberateness."
Braid,Wait until the Cyberpunk expansion comes out at a discount. It will probably be in its best state at that point.
Braid,"Red Dead 2 all the way. It took me like 3 attempts of replaying the beginning before I finally got hooked on the game and I wish it didn’t cause I’ve been missing out! 

It’s such a beautiful game. The guns are dope, (just experiment, you can’t lose unless you don’t like the gun which you can just store away) and the world is vast but alive

Like you’ll suddenly get ambushed or some fools will try to rob you; or woodcutters are felling trees, or a criminal is complaining on the back of a horse tied up"
Braid,I played both RDR2 on s a great experience but a little slower pace. Cyberpunk was broke and I fell off before I completed it
Braid,"Both are on sale pretty often but I would do RDR2 first without question. There are certain games you absolutely have to at least play. Don’t have to finish it if it don’t click but it’s an absolute must play. Cyberpunk is a great story with not the best gameplay, plus very raunchy. It’s gotten much better over the years however."
Braid,Red dead 2 is leagues better imo
Braid,Rdr2 is probably the best story in a game I have ever played. Full stop. It is genuinely one of the most amazing game stories there is. I would recommend it over cyberpunk based on that alone
Braid,Red Dead 1st by far
Braid,"Imo they are both very enjoyable from a story and gameplay angle. Some of it comes to taste (do you want a Wild West game or futuristic urban environment?). In my opinion you can’t go wrong but there is a reason Red Dead 2 is considered one of the greatest single player games of all time. 


Also, if this matters, cyberpunk is a 30-50 hour game if you complete the story and do a lot of side quests. Red dead 2 is more of a 50+ hour kind of game."
Braid,RDR2
Braid,I would say red dead now and cyberpunk later
Braid,"Cause I don't play video games no more
Never play video games
But Red Dead Redemption 2, that is not a game
It's an incredible journey through old American history
Fighting for your life and fighting for your family
Try to live your days with honor and integrity
That's not a game, that's an adult thing
That's not a game at all
That's like fuckin' Shakespeare
- Jack Black"
Braid,"Objectively RDR2 is the better game in almost every way, and it’s also cheaper right now. But man I can’t help but absolutely adore cyberpunk, even more than red dead. My brain says get red dead but my heart says get cyberpunk"
Braid,"Cyberpunk is pretty cool, but RDR2 is a goddamn masterpiece."
Braid,"If you like first person action RPG and sci -fi allot like I do Cyberpunk carried the magic. After the millionth plot twist I gave up on Rdr2, cyberpunk is short sweet and tragic."
Braid,I would say get red dead. It honestly looks like the better game out of the two and you can always get a refund if you really don't like it.
Braid,"Red dead 2, 100%"
Braid,Could not put RDR2 down finished in under a month. Cyberpunk took me at least 4.
Braid,99.9% of time my answer to this sub is just r/piratedgames
Braid,rdr2 all the way
Braid,Red Dead Redemption 2 !
Braid,Rdr 2
Braid,Both are amazing and should be played but get rdr2 first and wait till the new dlc to get cyberpunk.
Braid,"RDR2 is to date the best single game I’ve ever played by far.

It’s a masterpiece."
Braid,RDR2. Without a doubt.
Braid,RDR2
Braid,Do you want rootin tootin cowboy shootin or stressy messy cyborg depressy?
Braid,"I love both, but cyberpunk is good and RDR2 is next level amazing."
Braid,"In between missions, RDR2 is quite therapeutic to play."
Braid,"Late to the party, but would like to share my thoughts:

CP2077 has some fantastic writing and beautiful graphics. That being said, it’s a very shallow game in every other department. Given the world-building, it has amazing potential. If they had just given the game another couple years to incubate, it easily could’ve been one of the greatest action-adventure RPGs of its time. 

RDR2 is, on the other hand, *also* a game that has fantastic writing and beautiful graphics. It is, however, the type of game that *did* get the time it needed to fully flesh out all the other aspects of its gameplay. The result is a highly immersive experience with a lot of replayability and content that can last you hundreds of hours."
Braid,"It's not even really a fair comparison. 

RDR2 is a ridiculous rich and developed world with unbelievable detail (sometimes to much) and a story that is extremely engaging. It also has some of the best NPC reactions/interactions and is probably one of the top 3 hunting games in the last decade all rolled into one.

Cyberpunk is a mostly dead world with poor interactivity with npcs, a convoluted story that barely makes sense, and is almost entirely empty. I know I mentioned dead and empty twice but it needed repeating. The game had so much potential it didn't live up to its ridiculous. The games AI is almost as bad as basic vanilla skyrim back in the day. Luckily most of the bugs seem to have been dealt with but the game is still not worth buying in my opinion"
Braid,I've played both. They're both pretty good. Rdr2 is the best of the 2.
Braid,def red dead!
Braid,I have never met someone who didnt like rdr2 but cyberpunk seems to be hit or miss i have friends who love it but i have had no enjoyment playing it at all
Braid,"Cyberpunk is one of my all-time favourites, but Red Dead II is objectively the GOAT"
Braid,RDR 2 and don't think twice. Cyberpunk is good but RDR2 is a masterpiece and goated.
Braid,"I haven't played Cyberpunk yet, but RDR2 is a must play. I held off on playing RDR2 for a long time, due to people saying its slow paced. That was a mistake. I didn't feel slow to me, because the story is so good. If it was a movie, it would get an Oscar."
Braid,Rdr2 first and then cyberpunk
Braid,RDR2 no contest
Braid,RDR2 is at minimum a top 10 all time must play game
Braid,Red dead is wayyyy better than cyber.
Braid,"10/10 ""wild west"" (kind of) open world with a 10/10 story or a, well, cyberpunk open world with a 9,5/10 story


your call"
Braid,"Rdr2 is amazing. Cyberpunk is great and one of the better open world games I've played ever. I've played a lot of games and I adore this game. Wasn't perfect obviously with the console bugs but it's still great. If you're on pc then get it,next gen consoles then yeah. Previous gen then definitely no. 

After playing both, I can say both are great and damn good games. RDR2 is a masterpiece and Cyberpunk could one day end up being remembered as one. If not for the bugs and launch issues then kt would've been perfect imo"

Braid,"Cyberpunk is one of the more fun games I've played in years.  Red dead redemption 2 is the single greatest game I've ever played. Play both, but start with red dead."
Braid,How much is rdr2? I just bought it for $70? 😭😭😭😭
Braid,Anyone who is a gamer must play RDR2
Braid,Cyberpunk. That's just me though. This is really a question you need to ask yourself.
Braid,"Well I would say both, but I would suggest leaving cyberpunk aside until Phantom Liberty comes out and you can experience it at its highest. So for now, I recommend Red Dead. It's very fun, finished it recently, couldn't put my controller down, one week of my holiday gone, spent 110 hours on the game. Just don't overwhelm yourself and don't rush too much with the story, just enjoy the game's atmosphere and its randomness and progress in the story in whatever way feels best to you.

If you worry about completionism, I recommend making a manual save for everytime you start a new chapter."
Braid,Cyberpunk has finally gotten out of the shadow of its launch and is finally the game it was promised to be. But RDR 2 would be Rockstar’s masterpiece if the first game and GTA V didn’t already exist. Definitely check both games out but give Red Dead Redemption 2 a try first.
Braid,I liked Cyberpunk a lot but RDR2 is the way to go
Braid,Cyberpunk only because it going to get a overhaul that makes the game worth playing but red dead 2 is hella fun as well so wouldn't blame you if you got that over it since cyberpunk started off bad and kept people off it.
Braid,RDR2. It has an amazing story.
Braid,I haven't played Cyberpunk but RDR2 is such a masterpiece so that's my vote :)
Braid,Red Dead Redemption is a masterpiece. Cyberpunk in its current state is fine but nowhere near RDR2 level.
Braid,RDR2
Braid,"I played both, and 110% would pick RDR2 over cyberpunk. I think I’ve replayed it 4 times now. Played through Cyberpunk once and haven’t felt much like going back. Just a richer story in RDR2."
Braid,"i know everyone and their mom has already said it in this comment section, but i’m gonna add my voice to the choir anyways: rdr2 first, without a doubt."
Braid,RDR2 is great. would never spend money on cyberjunk
Braid,Rdr2 is slow as fuck cyberpunk is fast paced so i would go for cyberpunk (haven't been a fan of slow paced walking and riding Sims no matter how good the story is if they can't give it to me in a faster manner or keep me retained i ain't bout that)
Braid,RDR 2
Braid,"Wow, someone needs to rep cyberpunk here.  I loved it.  Best game of last 5 years for me.

Rdr2 was boring for me.  Scenery was pretty and all but I just found it repetitive.  Ride horse, shoot, do boring camp stuff, etc.  I dunno I like doing that stuff in real life.  

Cyberpunk is just super fun.  The soundtrack bangs.. you get swords implanted in your arms... the lore is super interesting.. lots of meaningful choices.  It's the only game I've ever replayed 

CP got a bad rap at launch.  I get it.  But on PS5 today it rocks"
Braid,"Cyberpunk will have a GOTY edition either with Phantom Liberty’s release or shortly thereafter. Acquiring RDR2 right now makes more sense, at least to me."
Braid,Buy rdr2 and when cyberpunk gets a complete edition buy that one later on
Braid,Both are incredible. I would not recommend getting Cyberpunk on a PS4 as it just stops working for me after like an hour of play time. RDR2 is a considerably better game but both are worth it
Braid,"Play RDR, then go to the second one - you won't regret it."
Braid,"I'm playing Cyberpunk rn and while id say it is a very good game and looks incredible, it is still nowhere near as polished as RDR2, combat, movement, interactions, npcs, customization and most of the things that make an open world/exploration game good are better in RDR2 in my opinion. But id still recommend you to get Cyberpunk later, it is a great game."
Braid,"Red dead 2, Cyberpunk isn't bad now, but RDR2 still has a good case for being the best game of all time."
Braid,I would get RDR2 first. Its long game with a much better story imo. Plus cyberpunk is getting that expansion in a few months that'll be overhauling some gameplay mechanics.
Braid,Cyberpunk.
Braid,"Red dead’s storymode is god tier, online can be amazing, Cyberpunk is very good, Perosnally I’d say red dead if you’ll play the online, cyberpunk if ur not gonna play the online"
Braid,"I say it depends on your system. I have a PS4 slim and cyberpunk is unplayable after the last large update. Gonna have to get a ps5 to actually play it. Could be my save corrupted somehow, but the game freezes after 20 minutes almost religiously."
Braid,RDR2 is one the best video games ever made. Definitely go for that first.
Braid,RDR2 any day of the week.
Braid,"Play RDR2 first and then buy Cyberpunk when the new expansion drops. I love both games, but it sounds like CP2077: Phantom Liberty will be the definitive edition"
Braid,"I would recommend both, but you need to play RDR2 if you haven't first"
Braid,Red dead redemption 2 a million times over cyberpunk
Braid,"RDR2, absolutely."
Braid,"I think cyberpunk and the expansion are on sale right now. But I’d go for rdr2 first considering it will be more instant gratification then having to wait till December for the expansion on cyberpunk, which will have a ton of new content meant to make the experience way better."
Braid,"Cyberpunk is poorly written, rdr2 is a masterclass"
Braid,RDR2 by a mile
Braid,"I played both games this year. I haven't finished Cyberpunk yet but it's pretty fun, I love everything about it except for some game breaking bugs and funny braindead AI. Both games are great but RDR2 is a triump; storytelling, characters, sound design, voice acting and impressive life-like world with a lot of details and hidden gems in it although gameplay is your standard Rockstar game, it's still an immersive game."
Braid,"I would recommend that you never buy cyberpunk and if Red dead is your thing, go for it. (It’s not my thing. But seriously, don’t buy cyberpunk.)"
Braid,Definitely Red Dead Redemption 2. Best game i have ever played since 2006
Braid,"huge cyberpunk fan here, i'd probably buy it when phantom liberty comes out since they're overhauling everything. RDR2 however was a masterpiece when it came out. definitely grab it, especially if on sale"
Braid,RDR2 will make you question if any game you ever played was good at all.
Braid,"Fair warning. I also say RDR2, BUT you need to go into it realizing it IS intentionally slower paced. Take your time with it, really invest in the characters and just hang out in the world, exploring and such. However, that said, I absolutely LOVE RDR2. It’s my favorite of all time."
Braid,Rdr2
Braid,"Both are really good 

I really enjoyed RDR2 a lot but Cyberpunk has something that really made me love it. 

I don't know if it's the setting or the overall dystopian world but it's a really great experience now

Plus Phantom Liberty is coming in september I believe so it might be worth a try"
Braid,"Both are on par and considered masterpieces of their own, CP story is more complex and fast paced while RDR2 is more of a slow burn kind of story. I think that CP is the superior game but I think you should buy both."
Braid,"Imo RDR2 is superior in essentially every aspect, I would definitely try it out."
Braid,Get both
Braid,"Definitely RDR2, seriously it contains the best protagonist you’ll ever play."
Braid,"Red dead is a must - cyberpunk is a should, so play RDR 2 first, then when the DLC is out pick up cyberpunk"
Braid,RDR2. I played both but for me RDR2 is just better.
Braid,"RDR2 barring it’s online is easily one of the best games ever made in my opinion. Same goes for RDR1, which can be played in either order. On top of that there’s undead nightmare as an added plus"
Braid,"I love both. But if I had to choose, it would be RDR2"
Braid,"Honestly both are really great games, you should pick based on what type of world you would like to dive into. Dystopian future, vs movie western."
Braid,Rdr2 killed my parents. We’re happily married now.
Braid,"RDR2 for sure!!!! I'm playing it again right now. Easily in my top 10 greatest games of all time. And with the amount of games I've played over 30+ years, that is really saying something."
Braid,Honestly they are both amazing In their own rights. RDR2 is considered one of the best games of all time tho so it’s an easy pick
Braid,"Obvious answer is rdr 2 first, but let me say this. No open world game will ever be the same after rdr2. Its miles ahead any game ive played to this day, technically and story wise."
Braid,"Both games are amazing. You can't go wrong with either - great storyline, great side quests, you can just dig yourself in for hours and hours. I'd highly recommend both. But if I had to pick one, I'd say RDR2. It left a bigger impression on me after finishing it."
Braid,"RDR2 is probably the better game from a technical standpoint, but I found the controls kind of kludgy to be honest.  I beat it once and have never felt the desire to replay it.

Cyberpunk on the other hand is the kind of game I can beat then immediately want to start a new character.  Yeah, it's undoubtably not as polished, but I just had more fun with it.  (Again, a big part of this probably just comes back to the controls, which were a lot smoother in Cyberpunk.)

Honestly...  You should just  get them BOTH!"
Braid,Rdr2 is easily the greatest console game ever made
Braid,"They’re very different games which is something to bare in mind. However, RDR2 is a much more polished product. I’d play that first and then pick up 2077/Phantom Liberty because they have basically said that the entire game is getting overhauled and polished with the next update/DLC in September. Both games will grip you emotionally as they’re very well written"
Braid,I played through cyberpunk twice. I stopped playing RDR2 when I got bored of riding my horsey.
Braid,Cyberpunk. Honestly RDR2 kind of bored me
Braid,And I will play it. Thanks for the reply.
Braid,Yeah what else is there to say? Although Cyberpunk is very enjoyable
Braid,I would say portal is a triumph.
Braid,"Sure, I guess then RDR2 it is. Thanks for the reply."
Braid,I won't pass on either but I guess first I will go through RDR2. Thanks for the reply.
Braid,I didn't feel the same. What is so unmissable about red dead for you?
Braid,To be honest it really depends. Personally I felt Red dead was a little to realistic for me and Cyber punk was more actiony.
Braid,">It will give you a thrill, make you feel like a badass, and then leave you in tears.

beautifully said."
Braid,Yes.
Braid,Same here it's hard to get into other games since I've played rdr2 I keep going back to it.
Braid,"Yeah, I guess waiting for the new update and dlc is the best option as new things will be added along with overhauls. Thanks for the reply."
Braid,What kind of depth does rdr2 have?
Braid,"Yeah. I just saw the dlc as pre-order along with Cyberpunk, but I think it will not be a great idea to buy it as they are adding and overhauling some features of the game in the next update probably. I guess waiting atleast till the update will be the right choice. Thanks for the reply."
Braid,I’ve just started the game is it best to wait for the DLC then and when does it drop ?
Braid,Phantom Pain is Metal Gear Solid. Cyberpunk 2077's expansion is called Phantom Liberty.
Braid,Do you know if ultimate version of RDR2 is worth it?
Braid,Any other game similar to rdr2 in gameplay? I love the sort of chill vibes with the option of action.
Braid,Careful it's CP2077
Braid,"Just a minor note that the outfit issue was fixed with a transmog function, so now you can play dress up and not just worry about stats.  But if you want to see your own outfit you have to drive a motorcycle."
Braid,Should I finish cyberpunk before the dlc?
Braid,"Yeah same here, RDR2 was amazing but I was way more immersed in Cyberpunk's world than RDR2's one 

Though both are really great games and should be played imo"
Braid,"Sorry to bother, but I would also like to ask which edition of RDR2 should I get. I will tell beforehand that I don't think I will be playing online version of the game."
Braid,I think most people agree that RDR2’s story is great and the strongest part of the game besides the visuals.
Braid,"Bruh. Who has the audacity to say RDR2 doesn’t have a good story?

It’s been widely, widely lauded as having one of the best stories in recent years"
Braid,"Thanks. I think story is subjective so might really like RDR2 too as I am not a huge fan of futuristic world. Though I am not a huge fan of Cowboys either (mediaeval fan here), though I might like it if I play it. Thanks for replying, I might get RDR2 now and wait for the update and expansion of Cyberpunk."
Braid,"I don't know about the story, but the best video game character is BT-7274. Period."
Braid,"This is how I feel. Cyberpunk was faster paced and I got more immediate gratification. I actually still haven’t gotten very far in RDR2 just because it has been slower-paced, but that being said, it is an exceptionally well-designed game"
Braid,"You’ve just described my exact experience. I really enjoyed RDR2 but we had just had our first baby when the it released - I just didn’t have the time and it fell by the wayside as a result, so I never finished it. Cyberpunk I managed to complete several times over on PS4 Pro and one more on PS5. Every single play through I’ve played completely differently to the last. It’s been immense. The sheer variety on offer with the story and the play styles means totally different experiences each time. While Red Dead is a beautiful and epic experience - it’s a fairly unilateral one. The only real variety coming from how many side missions or how much peripheral content you want to pursue. My wife played Cyberpunk more than I did - her sessions were vastly different to mine. I haven’t seen anything quite like it since the likes of Elder Scrolls."
Braid,“HANK! DON’T ABBREVIATE CYBERPUNK LIKE THAT! HAAAAANK!”
Braid,Not really. Where is the single player content?
Braid,"Same is experience. RDR2 more polished and you interact with more things, and NPC has better reactions. But cyberpunk is just more fun to play.

My biggest issue with rockstar games is that on rails and very linear. That’s being said they still quality games and will buying the next Rockstar game when it comes out."
Braid,You can always turn off aim assist for a better challenge in RDR2
Braid,What do you mean by terrible gameplay in RDR2?
Braid,"Yeah, just saw the amount of things they are adding in the update and expansion. Some of it is overhaul of current systems so I guess waiting for the update and the dlc is the best thing for now. Anyways, I would like to ask one more thing, should I buy RDR2 on Epic store or Steam because as far as I have heard, Epic store has a really bad mod support for games. And I guess there some fine mods for RDR2 so would like to get my hands on them. Thanks."
Braid,"> game i *paid* for. So

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*"
Braid,"I played the game about a year ago and only experienced like 5 bugs, none of them even being close to game breaking"
Braid,I bought and played a month or so ago and experienced almost 0 bugs. I think one quest messed up and that was it. After the most recent patch it seems pretty good. Also looks amazing with the ray tracing.
Braid,">the janky controls are super frustrating and honestly it’s pretty slow at times. I don’t need to watch long animations every time I pick something up or do anything. It’s more cowboy sim than game.  
>  
>Tried it 3 times and never make it past 10 hrs or so.

Not every game is made for you."
Braid,you think cyberpunk is a fail because of first week youtube videos and headlines. mostly everyone that plays the game says it is on track to becoming a no man's sky type revive
Braid,Cyberpunk absolutely does not have better writing…
Braid,no reason to skip one of the greatest games of this generation
Braid,"How is it overrated, there’s no game that has that level of detail, i can understand not enjoying the slow paced gameplay, but you can’t deny that no game has pushed the boundaries of open world like red dead in terms of immersion."
Braid,sure buddy go play ludo
Braid,You're getting hate but it's true. RD2 felt more like an interactive movie than a game.
Braid,"For reference, I have played both and love both, I even lean towards rdr2, but I am recommending based on OP's interests, unlike most of you"

Braid,I’ll be honest I thought RDR2 was a tedious piece of trash and nothing like the first game. Cyberpunk   Is more fun and you’ll want to play it more.
Braid,"Cyberpunk is getting a big expansion in September, along with a huge update that overhauls the whole game pretty much. Definitely hit RDR first and then grab cyberpunk after the update sometime."
Braid,Great story.  Great gameplay.  Great experience overall.
Braid,"I think it has some serious flaws but most of those flaws are in line with the vision of the game rather than being oversights. Like all the animations and forced walk sections, or the controls not being very arcadey with no jump button. The main flaw that defies this rule is the absurdly on-the-rails quests, which are typical for Rockstar.

All of that being said, it was in many ways a masterwork. Unparalleled attention to detail. Felt great to explore and discover. Could sink absurd hours into it or just pick up and play, and either way is fun. I find myself coming back to it all the time and finding things I missed.

It was imo the first Open World to feature both breadth and depth in world design without being riddled with bugs. You can tell the crunch went into perfecting the details rather than throwing the game together.

Gameplay and story not revolutionary but consistently solid."
Braid,It’s an absolute masterpiece.
Braid,"I've played and beaten both, and I love both games. That being said RDR2 is a fucking masterpiece. I don't know any game I'd pick over rdr2 in a one on one."
Braid,"It's probably the deepest and most fully realized open world ever crafted, filled with rich and compelling characters, emergent choices, and awesome things to discover. It's held up by many experts as one of the iconic examples of video games as art. But go off, chief. Contrarianism is all the rage."
Braid,"It would be easier to list what components of RDR2 *do not* have depth:

Enemies - it's all pew pew guys across the board.

Mounts - it's all horses across the board.

As for narrative, gameplay, world building, world interaction, customization, side missions, character developments, npc interactions, etc. etc. etc., I could go on but I've given your clearly catty, insincere comment enough effort and time, maybe just become more interesting in the future and open up with a compelling point next time."
Braid,September 26.
Braid,Haha very true that was a Freudian slip!
Braid,"If you can get it cheap then maybe but I don't think it's worth it, personally."
Braid,Rdr1 is the only one I can think of
Braid,GTA
Braid,Death Stranding I suppose both tedious games but are top 3 for me
Braid,Oh that’s good to know. And thanks for the correction
Braid,No they plan to overhaul the ai and make other changes. (Better Skill tree for example)
Braid,"In which case, the cheapest version. The ultimate edition just has online content iirc"
Braid,"Is the story really good or are the characters just carrying everything? Playing rn and the story is kind of meh. Rockstar games never really had a great main story, but that is not necessary with all the fun.

Not saying I'm right, just how I am feeling right now."
Braid,[deleted]
Braid,"Many actually. And even as a huge fan myself, I understand that the pacing of that story is all over the place and many of my friends drop it after initial 2-3 snowy hours and I keep on trying to convince them."
Braid,"When I was contemplating rdr2 I felt like you. I also was unsure about the horse riding mechanic, as I was used to GTA and using vehicles. And I was unsure I would enjoy the 1899 setting. But let me tell you, get this game! It’s so good. You will end up being fascinated with the world, including the horse riding."
Braid,"I've tried to get into RDR2 multiple times, I really appreciate the quality and complexity of the game, but I just can't, because I find the entire cowboy setting to be boring and uninteresting."
Braid,"The game was so good and complete at release, it didn’t need it."
Braid,"There's a reason why they made auto aim the default in RDR2, because the combat is so clunky that it needs it"
Braid,It’s a very boring gameplay that’s for sure.
Braid,Mainly because the mission design and combat are so bad
Braid,"I play on PS5, so I wouldn't know much about epic store vs steam. Maybe try asking on the Red Dead sub, they will probably give better answers than I could"
Braid,You can mod pretty much everygame on steam just as well if not better than epic. Some games even have steam cumunity mods through the steam store such as l4d2. Really the only reason id choose epic over steam for anything is if epic is giving a game away for free and even them there are some cases where id still just rather buy it from steam.
Braid,Good bot
Braid,The freind i borrowed it from said the same thing so i guess it varied from person to person. My experience was a mess. Nothing game breaking in the sense that i couldn't progress but a lot of religing becouse i got stuck in terminals and uis. Also had this one where jackie always had his gun out no matter what animtion he was doing or where he was. Even had it on that mission where we coukdnt bring our guns. Nothing could have been done to fix that one just had to accept that that was jakie now for that playthrough
Braid,"Im with this guy, never had any game breaking bugs in this game from day 1. Playing PC with a good gpu over on my end tho. If youve got a 30 series gpu or newer cyberpunk runs literally fine"
Braid,Yeah thats one thing i can personally attest to it looks really good. Also it supports dlss 3 fram generation so it runs really smooth a 4000 series card.
Braid,"This is a stupid fucking reply

Nowhere did they say that. They're allowed to criticise the controls of a game when someone asks for opinions on that game. Opinions from both sides are important when deciding whether to buy something or not."
Braid,Never said it was.
Braid,It's widely agreed the controls and combat are super clunky.
Braid,"Opinions are opinions my dude, both games had amazing writing but I felt more connected to Cyberpunk."
Braid,Guess the opinions are divided. I didn't like rdr2's writing very much. What was so great about it then?
Braid,I agree about the level of detail. For sure it's impressive in that aspect. It's just soooo fucking slooow man. I almost didn't finish that game considering how tedious it was. I'm sorry.
Braid,Ok
Braid,"Tedious as f... imo. I almost didn't finish it, but the story got me through. Gameplay was the worst!"
Braid,"Weird, I was raised by fast paced shooters and such and absolutely adored rdr2 despite its slower nature."
Braid,"Want to cook some food? 10 minute animation per piece cooked. Want to loot something? 10 minute animation of you picking the body up. Want to skin an animal? 45 minute animation. Oh, and btw, you need hundreds of pelts if you want to do side content. It is the most ridiculous shit.

Everyone kept telling me I needed to get to chapter 2 to really get a feel for the game. I made it past chapter 2 and I still hate the game. Only now I'm past my refund window and hate it even more now.

Every mission is you riding with some member of your crew on horseback for 45 minutes while you get gigantic exposition dumps. RDR2 is the game you get when you distill the WORST parts of the GTA franchise down into a cowboy game.

This was the first game that was universally praised, in a genre I love, that I hated to it's core. It has me questioning whether or not i should even bother buying the last of us on PC."
Braid,Where are details on the huge update? Can’t seem to find any but very interested
Braid,Still playing cyberpunk on a console like ps5 is like playing in a ghost town. If OP has a decent rig he should definitely hit cyberpunk in September.
Braid,"Wasn't this supposed to come out this month? I am very excited about the DLC, but I'll believe the release date once I've downloaded it."
Braid,"Will they completely drop their sad excuse for an armor system, their sad excuse for a weapon system, and their sad excuse for a perk system? Oh wait… that’s like every system in the damn game. Would be silly to ask for that.

Edit: holy shit it looks like they are!"
Braid,"I thought it was very visually impressive and well acted. Also the soundtrack fucking slaps. I love the soundtrack. It also usually managed to capture the intended vibe very well. But it wasn't very thought-provoking. And some of the side content just completely misses the mark. 

Cyberpunk is a lot less polished and pleasant. But some of the sidequests could have carried entire high-quality indiegames."
Braid,"Trailing missions, long ass point a to point b travel, goofy ah shooting, extremely linear missions, breaking the games economy with that stage coach robbery mission. Can’t deny the flaws."
Braid,Did not know a simple question was a clearly catty insincere comment....
Braid,"Lol what a pathetically insecure reply. RDR2 has absolutely zero depth when it comes to gameplay, mission structure, level design, or npc interactions. It’s all shallow set dressing for a pretty decent story that would’ve worked better as a TV series. As an actual videogame, it’s average at best."
Braid,"> I've given your clearly catty, insincere comment enough effort and time, maybe just become more interesting in the future and open up with a compelling point next time.

You’re right - how dare he ask a simple question about your favourite game?! The audacity of /u/ihave0idea0 knows no limits! 

Personally I find RDR2 wholly unappealing to me, mostly because what I’ve seen of the combat mechanics seems quite repetitive and more importantly not skill-based.  
But I also don’t like the Elder Scrolls series or Cyberpunk for the same reason, so this thread just isn’t for me."
Braid,"Yeah, been through that. And online doesn't do it for me"
Braid,I actually have that. Might give it a try
Braid,Oh I’ll wait then damn okay thanks.
Braid,Thank you very much.
Braid,"It’s definitely more character driven than plot driven. It might take a while for the story to get going, but when it does, it’s really some of the best dramatic writing I’ve ever seen in anything. It’s worth sticking with for sure."
Braid,"… that’s what a story is, a journey of characters through an arc. The plot of 99% of stories is the same basic shit."
Braid,"Fair, I can’t seem to get into Witcher 3, despite being a huge fan of the lore and gameplay.

It just… feels so huge and cumbersome"
Braid,Yeah the story feels very disjointed. You do like 5 completely unrelated main story missions and then eventually come across another mission that advances the story. How’s that a great story? I get that people like those unrelated main missions since they like long games and are willing to tolerate a somewhat disjointed story if it means a longer game. But you can’t tell me that’s a good story. A good story must have a good flow.
Braid,Rdr2 is easily top 5 of last gen
Braid,"Yeah it's not even gameplay.
Just high quality movie"
Braid,Tried that but didn't get any answer. Other modding subreddits had no idea either. I guess I will try asking there again. Thank you very much.
Braid,"Actually had a coupon on epic store, so wouldn't want it to go to waste. I have some other the list but would live to know if epic store version can be modded. The RDR2 subreddit seems kinda dead with most of the posts with no replies so I think I might not get one there either."
Braid,Best bot
Braid,">This is a stupid fucking reply

Exactly my thoughts lol.

I absolutely loved RDR2 but I can totally see how it can be boring for some people. In fact, I've seen plenty of comments on various subs saying exactly that, so I think it's important thing to highlight for OP."
Braid,"It was cool at first but then I just got tired of it quick. I also work 50hrs a week with like 1 hour commute one way so I just don’t have time for slow games anymore. 
That being said getting off a horse just to pick something up every time is just an awful game play design."
Braid,What a debby downer you are. Pessimistic much? Lol
Braid,Valid
Braid,"[Check it](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/147domj/everything_new_with_phantom_liberty_and_patch_17/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)

I’m pretty excited"
Braid,It says September 26th on steam. Even if you don't get the DLC you still get access to the massive overhaul btw.
Braid,I think the side content is amazing. Maybe some things could be better but it is very good
Braid,"Yeah I get that but thought provoking is not what I expect from Rockstar, or any game outside of select RPGs.

It’s more like a great execution of a tried and true formula. If I wanted a thought provoking Western, I’d reread Blood Meridian, not play an open world game."
Braid,There’s nothing thought provoking about Cyperpunk either
Braid,They’re not flaws…  They’re features!
Braid,Yeah rockstar hasn't improved it's gameplay since GTA San Andreas. It's a shame because visually and story wise the games are brilliant
Braid,"It's not a simple question, it's probably the most highly praised game of the last decade, pretending that you know nothing about it whatsoever and have decided to randomly come to me to learn more about it is naive and stupid at best."
Braid,"And this is the kind of dumbass mentality that went behind asking 'hurr, what kind of depth rdr2 got?'"
Braid,"The OP asked which game should he play, not your emotional personal take that doesn’t help at all and literally NO ONE cares about"
Braid,I hear you. Just the most similar gameplay I could think of. Basically the same game at a different time period with different technology.
Braid,"Story wise, propably. Gameplay, definetly not."
Braid,I dont see why not you wouldnt be able too. Modding alters your local files on your system so i feel like whichever store front you bought it from wouldnt matter. All the games ive ever modded were on steam but i never had to actually interact with steam to do it so i feel like the same processes would have worked even if i bought them from epic.
Braid,"Fair enough, that horse thing is true"
Braid,"Everyone I know loves this game. So I never criticize it around them, because I would feel like a debbie downer. It was just exciting to finally see someone else hate it."
Braid,Everything he said is valid and he’s entitled to his opinion. That isn’t pessimism
Braid,"The shredder of panda guy I’m replying to blocked  me, then reported me to Reddit for some kinda wellness check?? People are so weird.. wtf"
Braid,"Thank you. 

Man I am hype now."
Braid,I'm happy for you. That I didn't feel the same doesn't mean I want to take that away from you
Braid,"I don't think thought provoking was something they were not trying to do. The story of the main characters in what is essentially a cult was compelling but just not for that long. 

Also looking at cyberpunk again. I think there are plenty of moments there that could be labeled thought provoking. 

Maybe I just wanted the wrong things from the game."
Braid,"No? What about Joshua's quest line? Rivers quest line? The quests with the mayor and his wife? V's story, the different endings. Even the quest with the vending machine ends up asking some interesting questions."
Braid,Let’s hope for gta 6 I personally didn’t like rdr2 as much as other people did for personal reasons but I still thought it was a fantastic game
Braid,"Damn, you even double-downed on it.

People ARE allowed to not know everything about RDR2, man.

You clearly spend a lot of time thinking about your favourite video games - that’s fine, but you should realise that other people may have other interests and may actually not know much about it, if at all.

As I said I personally find the gameplay uninteresting (not sure how you can think it has a lot of depth, tbh) - and a game without good gameplay is just a bad game to me. Therefore I have little interest in Rockstar games in general, because their gameplay is usually super casual-oriented.

As for the rest of you description of the depth of the game, you used a bunch of buzz-words but didn’t actually explaining anything to the guy.

Good graphics, good story, world building, character development and voice acting are great, but if that’s all there is to it, I’d rather watch a movie or read a book tbh. Gameplay is where games are at for me, and a lot of people in general."
Braid,"Did you mean to reply to someone else?

How am I the emotional one for replying to someone having a complete meltdown at the mère idea that someone didn’t know the alleged qualities of RDR2?

I explained why I thought that neither games thought of by OP were particularly good in my opinion. That’s very relevant to the discussion.

What’s the point of your needlessly aggressive comment that no one asked for and no one cares about, to use your own words?"
Braid,Exactly. However I think my emotional investment was larger in rdr2. But time period doesn't really matter.
Braid,"Thanks for the reply. Just wanted to make sure. Actually, I heard and experienced issues with modding, especially with Bethesda games in Epic Games Store. And in general have heard people saying that Epic store is pretty bad if someone wants to play with mods. Modding for me is one of the main and most fun things (especially in games like Skyrim) so sometimes no excess to mods can be a huge deal breaker for me."
Braid,"""10 minute animation. 45 minute animation"". Yeah sure  that's real valid isn't it lol. Someone being overly negative and blowing something out of proportion is considered to be pessimistic to me. I never said he was wrong and couldn't have an opinion. I just called him a debby downer. I'm entitled to my opinion as well right?"
Braid,"Hey, what didn’t you like about the side content? I guess hunting is kinda barebones"
Braid,"Rivers quest was so boring. Go here, fetch this. Fetch that. Search the nephews room for clues. Snooze fest. It was nothing I haven’t seen before a million times. Most of the side quests were boring as hell. There were some cool moments, but thought provoking? Nah."
Braid,"Don't care, didn't read; get more interesting and stop leaning on sarcasm as a crutch for your lack of personality."
Braid,Continue with your non contributions. Op asked which game and here you are just wasting thread space
Braid,If you want to rant about how terrible RDR2 is make your own post
Braid,"Your making comments on someone’s character over a game, if anything you’re a Debby downer"
Braid,"Some of the sidequests were kinda stupid and unsatisfying. The one that stuck in my mind the most was the one where you encounter that woman who takes advantage of two guys with disabilities and the ark of the story is that the guys don't want to be with her because she's an absolutely horrible, abusive human being. Then when you find them they realise that they're still gonna go with her. 

Like what's the point? I had no input, the ark of the characters was to learn to put up with an abuser and it took like 20 minutes. 

&#x200B;

Not to say that I encountered no good sidequests. The one where you help a woman learn to live in the forest was lovely. But the game to me was littered with moments that ended in an unsatisfying anticlimax."
Braid,"Very interesting. What did you think of >!
Jackies funeral? !<"
Braid,"That comes from the guy that screeched and had a complete meltdown when someone else dared ask which kind of depth RDR2 had, because how dare he not know your favourite video game.

There is 0 irony in my last comment, btw! Not that I would expect you to understand irony…

Lmfao, reddit basement-dweller moment."
Braid,"What’s YOUR contribution, lad? What’s your purpose? Why are you commenting?

As I said above, I explained why I thought neither of the games were particularly good in my opinion. That’s highly relèvent on a sub where people ask whether they should buy specific games.

My comment is on topic. Yours aren’t and are just useless attacks with 0 contribution on the actual subject. Are you perhaps an alt of the other guy? That’s the o my way this would make sense, tbh. You’re weird"
Braid,"Ranting? For a whole 2 lines? Do you even know what a rant is? Open a dictionary ffs

The guy above had a meltdown when someone asked a simple question, I pointed out to him that no everyone necessarily liked every game or knew everything about every game.

That’s highly relevant to the conversation.

Once again, what is YOUR contribution here, apart from attacking me for no reason?"
Braid,You're making comments about my character over a reddit post. A bit hypocritical.
Braid,"Well, I didn't realize they had disabilities. Maybe I'm just stupid. I'm guessing your talking about the one where you had to keep punching and kicking those guys to prove which one was stronger? 

I saw it as funny, and I never saw them go back to her, I don't think I ever saw them after their final mission.  


Maybe I just didn't find them or I'm stupid. Oh well, I enjoyed those missions, and yeah that one with charlotte (woman in forest) was great."
Braid,Getting his bike was the best part
Braid,"No, you were in fact, weird because no one cares what you don’t like. I was genuinely interested in seeing how much people loved one game over the other but here you are."
Braid,I already gave my contribution
Braid,"My contribution was that I love both games but I feel like RDR two gets the one here because not only is it one of the greatest games of all time, but the story is pretty impactful"
Braid,My context might seem illiterate because I am using voice to text
Braid,"I think we're talking about another quest.  I googled it, it's called ""the smell of grease paint""."
Braid,"Intruiging. I absolutely love that quest for how real it feels. 
>! How it takes the time to mourn and speak to the people that this affected. Presenting a death so realistically gave so much validity to the rest of the world. It made me remember times I've lost people. 
Death in video games is never presented like this. !<"
Braid,"That sounds like a you issue, tbh

- Some people love one game more than the other

- some people prefer the other one

- some people like neither of them

These are all valid opinions on the exact same subject. I’m in the third camp, for reasons that I explained. I would therefore recommend OP to buy neither of these games if the reasons I gave resonate with him.

It’s hilarious that you don’t see that my comment is very much on topic for this thread - logic isn’t your forte, huh"
Braid,"Clearly not in this chain of comment, which is why I’m asking you what you’re even doing here."
Braid,"Fair enough! That’s understandable.

My contribution was that I didn’t like either of them for the reason stated above (gameplay isn’t interesting or skill-based enough, and that’s what matters most in games in my opinion), and therefore wouldn’t recommend either of them.

Don’t you see how my opinion is just as valid as yours? Again, why are you commenting here?"
Untitled Goose Game,"It’s about 2 or 3 hours to beat the main story, and there are a bunch of extra objectives after you beat the story. It’s a game unlike any other I’ve played, so at the very least, it’s a unique experience"
Untitled Goose Game,"It’s fun. I’d recommend waiting until it goes down a little in a sale, since it is _really_ short, but like, it’s definitely not bad for it’s price if you really want it now as well."
Untitled Goose Game,"It's a silly game but I think it's worth it. It's pretty easy to beat, and short though. If you're looking for a relaxing funny game to pass some time, I'd say get it."
Untitled Goose Game,I have a friend in Nintendo Switch with 100 hours playtime in  Untitled Goose Game
Untitled Goose Game,"Its a few hours to beat the story, with a good number of post-story objectives afterwards.

What was the big sell for me was watching my kids play it.  They've clocked at least 30 hours on the game, often just restarting again and again to taunt the farmer.

Its also $15.  In a simple ""Dollar Per Entertainment Hour"" , I would rank it as ""Well Worth It."""
Untitled Goose Game,HONK
Untitled Goose Game,Not worth the money imo
Untitled Goose Game,"Slightly unpopular but I’m not really a fan, gameplay feels kind of clunky and it suffers from a lack of tutorials at the beginning, if I have to google to solve the “puzzles” the game doesn’t really help you start off"
Untitled Goose Game,"I think so yes, it's a cute and relaxing game."
Untitled Goose Game,"I would wait for a sale, 20$ is too much for just 3-5 hours of gameplay"
Untitled Goose Game,I wouldn’t pay more than $10 for it.
Untitled Goose Game,"It takes about 4 hours to beat and doesn't have that much replay value.

That said, it is one of very few games which have made me laugh out loud multiple times while playing.  
It is much better when played with friends IMO, laughing at what each other does and working out the problems together.

I would recommend it if you have friends to play with, I would say wait for a sale if not. If you've seen a youtuber play it then you've probably seen about half of the game. There's not really anything more to it than what you probably saw."
Untitled Goose Game,"Its a small and silly game, it doesn't take much time to complete it but the time you get out of it is absolutely delightful. I recommend it a 100%, I loved every second of it."
Untitled Goose Game,"If you wanna pay 20$ for a switch game, I would totally recommend Celeste. Well, they're both very different games, but that's what i would recommend."
Untitled Goose Game,"It was pretty short, practically zero replayability imo, but it was a bit of fun. Not sure if it was totally worth it, but there's probably worse ways to spend $20"
Untitled Goose Game,Yes! Its fun. HONK
Untitled Goose Game,Yes.
Untitled Goose Game,It's a small game but yes you should. It's fun and hilarious to play.
Untitled Goose Game,I like to play that game when im in a bad mood. Its fun to bully/annoy town people and its pretty cute too.
Untitled Goose Game,yes
Untitled Goose Game,Yes
Untitled Goose Game,Iam waiting for it for ps4
Untitled Goose Game,"Yes!  Yes!  Fucking Yes!  Do It!

Toss that fucking rake in the lake!!!

YEEEEEEET!"
Untitled Goose Game,gets boring after 15 minutes lmao
Untitled Goose Game,"I think it's a great game even at full price. It's 2-4 hrs, maybe 6 if you have trouble and don't look up spoilers. It's a really unique game and one you cM show off to people. Everyone I know who has played it loves it."
Untitled Goose Game,The game is great and fun to play but the main story objectives dont take very long. But the extra objectives take longer. It doesnt have a lot of replay value though.
Untitled Goose Game,"The game is fun, unique and it made me laugh out loud more than once. But it does feel too short, like you completed the first world, not the whole game. And once I beat it, I didn't really feel the urge to go back to it. All in all, I'd say it's worth it. I got it for 5 dollars on the epic games store though."
Untitled Goose Game,WATCH JACKSEPTICEYES VIDEO IN IT!!! HJÖNK HJÖNK AM GOOSE!
Untitled Goose Game,Tbh have never heard of this game! Let me know how it is. If you decide to buy it.
Untitled Goose Game,hella yea
Untitled Goose Game,It’s only a few hours of gameplay but the best you’ll ever see. It’s hilarious and definitely worth the money
Untitled Goose Game,HJÖNK HJÖNK
Untitled Goose Game,"What!?!? You never play untitled goose game before??? Pffft. I'm not supposed to give my opinion, but give it a try, and then you can can tell me if you like it or not"
Untitled Goose Game,"Definitely, it’s one of the best game I’ve played in a few years. (The other ones being FTL and Life is Strange)."
Untitled Goose Game,"Its a good game, its one of those stupidly fun games that makes you laugh"
Untitled Goose Game,"HONK

That means ""yes, it's a fun game that can be played many times"" in goose."
Untitled Goose Game,"To me, it looks like a sorta puzzle/stealth game, it's not a style of game i'm super interested in"
Untitled Goose Game,Not worth it. Watch a play-through for same result.
Untitled Goose Game,*rake in the lake*
Untitled Goose Game,it's $20. it shouldn't even be a question.
Untitled Goose Game,"Do games on switch fall in price? Ive not noticed that much, if atall?"
Untitled Goose Game,How the story’s only 3 hours
Untitled Goose Game,I’ll say they did a fantastic job with their marketing but I wouldn’t personally buy it.
Untitled Goose Game,"Yep, it's basically just a meme game atm. It costs too much, is very, very short, and if you've just watched someone play it a bit or watched Dunkey's meme video on it . . .you've basically already seen what the game has to offer. You can play around and do silly stuff in it on your own, but I'd say most people could just watch a few meme compilations of it and save the money and get the same experience"
Untitled Goose Game,"It explains how to do all the actions at the start of the game, though.  
And the game tells you _what to do,_ you just have to find out _how to do it._ And its usually a simple matter of messing around, and trial and error, to find out how to complete them."
Untitled Goose Game,I share this exact opinion
Untitled Goose Game,Celeste is a hidden gem r/tomorrow
Untitled Goose Game,"That’s based on perspective. Right now for me, 20 dollars is all I got for a new game for maybe 3-6 months. So this 20 dollars I gotta spend carefully and I really don’t wanna pirate an Indie game like this, hurts devs a shit ton more than it hurts bigger companies.

20 bucks for 6 hours of game play just doesn’t seem worth it even if it’s top notch. I got 200+ hours outta 15 bucks on Terraria or 500+ hours on 20 dollars for Minecraft. Or 35+ hours and still going on SUPERHOT for 20 dollars. Basically my point is I don’t know if 20 dollars is worth 6 hours of gameplay. Maybe if this gameplay is best I’ll ever get and I get a shareable/resellable physical copy could be worth it."
Untitled Goose Game,We don't all have $20 to burn
Untitled Goose Game,"I just meant if it goes on sale or something, which it has, and likely will again at some point. I don’t anticipate that Untitled Goose Game will depreciate in value more permanently in the near future though.

To answer your question though, Switch games do depreciate in value, at least physical releases anyways. It’s just that most games associated closest with the system are first or second party titles, and Nintendo is really stingy about letting their games fall in value. Games from other companies tend to though, albeit, more slowly than on other systems, likely on account that the Switch has only been out for a couple of years, and that the Switch version of a multi-platform release is usually the most profitable one ( even if not necessarily the best-performing )."
Untitled Goose Game,"Just the digital games from the Nintendo store, physical copies rarely change."
Untitled Goose Game,If you wish list an item you'll get an email about a sale.
Untitled Goose Game,"Then you haven't paid attention to what happens to mario + rabbids. It can be 60 bucks one day, and the next day it's 20 bucks."
Untitled Goose Game,Bullying Griffin McElroy probably.
Untitled Goose Game,I’m guessing just goofing around
Untitled Goose Game,15 bucks for 2 hours.
Untitled Goose Game,"On the other hand, press y to honk."
Untitled Goose Game,"Plus, just think ""How would an Asshole solve this?""  and do that."
Untitled Goose Game,I think that for the first puzzle or so it’s helpful to guide the player so they realize what they can do and how the AI reacts to certain actions. Trial and error isn’t very fun
Untitled Goose Game,Buy Hollow Knight or Dead Cells of $20 is all you've got and you want it to stretch.
Untitled Goose Game,Missed opportunity for “goosing around”
Untitled Goose Game,Oof. That’s worse than I thought.
Untitled Goose Game,Fifteen bucks for closer to 3 and a half hours
Untitled Goose Game,Can't argue with this
Untitled Goose Game,Dammit
Omori,"About game mechanics: From what you will have seen from its Steam page, Omori has a turn based combat system. Turn based combat is not my cup of tea in general, but the turn based combat in Omori is unique, fun and done well. When it comes to combat, you can encounter some enemies who have emotions. They can be happy, sad or angry. Each emotion has its pros and cons in fights. Also, each emotion is weaker/stronger to another emotion. 
Apart from emotion mechanics, the game has another mechanic called ""Teamwork"". The main characters (Omori, Aubrey, Kel and Hero) show some speech bubbles during fights, which allow you to do some actions: help another character (heal, increase defense, et.c.) or make them happy/angry/sad or do a second attack on the enemies or a powerful attack with all 4 characters if you have a lot of Teamwork points. 

Outside of fights, Omori follows the usual RPG mechanics. Talk to NPCs, do sidequests, explore and find (weird) things. This game certainly encourages exploring and thankfully the maps are not big so it doesn't get tiring. Apart from the story bosses, you can also find and fight optional bosses throughout the game.

About the story: The story (and the horror) is good, but it needs time to unravel. Without going to spoiler territory, the story isn't certainly a YouTube creepypasta. Speaking of spoilers, avoid story spoilers as much as you can. You will enjoy the story better this way.

 Price: In my opinion the price is fair, especially with how much effort has gone to the game. The music, the (pixel) graphics are very good and have an aesthetic vibe. Also according to ""How Long to Beat It"", Omori is quite a long game and it has 3 endings. To finish it once it needs about 20 hours, and if you try to go completionist it will take about 60 hours. So if you decide to buy it you will get your money's worth.

Even if it's not a genre you usually play, you should give Omori a chance. Especially now that it is on discount for the Steam summer sale."
Omori,"play it, that is i have to say to you"
Omori,It’s fun with just the right mix of creepy. Buy it.
Omori,"Omori was the biggest surprise of any game I've played in the last year. Not just because of the 'psychological horror' stuff you mentioned, but the *sheer amount of content*. I figured this would be a little adventure game with some jump scares or something, but holy shit was I wrong.

This is a massive adventure which I can only describe as Legend of Zelda meets Undertale. The gameplay is a lot of fun, the settings are incredibly varied and interesting, and there sheer amount of areas, items, and things to do are just incredible. The characters are super memorable and the things they do even more so. Not only that, but there is a ton of replay value due to the various choices you can make and multiple endings you can achieve. The best part is how almost everything you see relates to the central themes of the game, which I'm not going to talk about AT ALL because you have to see it for yourself. The story is absolutely gripping and should be experienced as blindly as possible. Just jump in and see what happens. It will definitely surprise you."
Omori,No.
Omori,Yes 👏🏾
Omori,It's a bad game?
Omori,No.
Omori,I... Think he's traumatized
World of Horror,"Pretty sure Until Dawn, Little Hope, Man of Medan, Resident Evil 7 are all on PS+. Until Dawn would probably be my highest 
recommendation of that group followed by RE7. There’s also Visage which isn’t on PS+ but scary af. I’ve also heard really great things about Madison, and Martha is Dead but I haven’t tried either of them yet."

World of Horror,"Welcome to the game 2, Blair Witch, layers of fear, and Visage are some of my favorites"
World of Horror,Until Dawn on PS4
World of Horror,Resident Evil or the Evil Within. RE is traditional storm the base type zombie horror and Evil Within messes with your head and gives you a tough storyline.

World of Horror,I already saw someone say it but visage was my too scary game ever
World of Horror,"Amnesia is scary af but less of ""game play"" than the two you mentioned, turned into a lot of bland walking for me. Any recent Resident Evil is a fantastic horror shooter. As is Dead Space, top 3 scariest games imo. Honorable mention to Soma, same vein as Amnesia but incredible psychological horror storytelling"
World of Horror,"Subnautica

World of Horror,Second RE7. They shifted the whole series and wow did they do amazing. Some of the animations etc look photo real and first person makes it way more terrifying.
Event[0],RDR2 is an absolute triumph. It MUST be played.
Event[0],"I would generally recommend RDR2, which is one of the best games ever made.

Presentation is absolutely stunning across the board. Graphics, SFX, music, voice acting, all are absolutely stellar.

Gameplay-wise is also phenomenal. Essentially, to summarise, it plays as a 3rd-person shooter, with some RPG and simulation elements - it really shines in making you *feel* like the character you're playing as, that is, a cowboy in the late 19th/early 20th century, with all the gambling, outlawing, hunting, etc.

The content available is frankly some of the best value in any videogame. This is the most well-realised open-world game ever, in my estimation - an immersive world that feels natural and alive, that exists independently of you but reacts to your decisions. The story is fully fleshed out, dramatic, personal and intimate, but also self-aware enough to shine all the wild west tropes through. You have further an entire online mode that I haven't even touched yet.

When considering the preferences you laid out, I'm even more convinced you'll enjoy it. I'd recommend it over cyberpunk to anyone, but even more to someone with your preferences."
Event[0],"RDR2 is probably the better made game but I also loved Cyberpunk, it’s story, and it felt very creative and new. I liked someone else’s idea of doing RDR2 and buy Cyberpunk when DLC comes out so you can transition straight to DLC"
Event[0],"Love both, but I’d start with RDR2 buddy. And just know, it’ll be awhile before you start Cyberpunk once you get immersed into that work and Aruthur"
Event[0],U can miss cyberpunk. U cant pass on RDR2! Easy as that
Event[0],"Rdr2 without a doubt. The most beautiful open world, lots of chill out time, lots of random and very well written scripted quests, a sense of history with a bit of the absurd, and a tragic crime family story. It will give you a thrill, make you feel like a badass, and then leave you in tears."
Event[0],"I’m sure there will be a Complete Edition for Cyberpunk/Phantom Liberty, so wait on that. Cyberpunk was great; loved the story, Night City and the RPG elements. Granted I played on PS5 when that version was released. 

Red Dead Redemption II is one of the greatest games ever made. Five years later and it’s still worth full price. The quantity and quality of content is impressive."
Event[0],RDR2
Event[0],"As someone that was super hyped cyberpunk and hit it day 1, as faulty and buggy as it was at the time on my ps4, I enjoyed it, and now 100 times better with the next gen update and all on my ps5, that being said, RDR2 was one of the best games of the last generation, and it plays great on next gen consoles… definitely recommend RDR2, it’s not an rpg but getting lost in that world and along with the things you discover in it are very rpg like to me, definitely recommend RDR2"
Event[0],"RDR2.

Cyberpunk is cool, but it will be much cooler in a few months with the update/remake

I also would only get cyberpunk if you have at least a PS5/next gen/pc"
Event[0],Red dead redemption until cyberpunk dlc is released
Event[0],"No question, RDR2 all the way!"
Event[0],"I feel like RDR2 is a much better overall game, but is more divisive than you would be lead to believe. It's a slow burn story game, so if you're cool with that, it's way better.

Cyberpunk is exactly as you expect it to look and feel."
Event[0],"Cyberpunk base game is also been a lot of improvements when the DLC releases so get cyberpunk then with the DLC, for now its time for RDR2 Boah!!"
Event[0],RDR2
Event[0],RDR2 without a doubt
Event[0],"Red dead, even though I mostly play rpgs. Even though it’s fairly polished now I just find Cyberpunk to be boring. Idk I hope someday I can engage with it but it’s not now."
Event[0],"RDR2

Cyberpunk is also a very good game, and I do recommend you play it eventually

But with the DLC just around the corner (only three months away in fact) you should wait until it releases before getting it"
Event[0],"Wait for the DLC and play RDR2 while you wait. I personally liked Cyberpunk more, but RDR2 is amazing aswell."
Event[0],"Rdr2 and I liked both of them, but RDR2 is on another level"
Event[0],Rdr2
Event[0],"RDR2 is the most polished game I have ever played. The environments are highly-interactive and the world with it’s animals and people respond to you and each other in a very believable way. It’s story is an engaging epic action-drama grounded in reality. It’s extremely immersive.

CP2077 had very rough beginnings and, when I last played it late last year, that roughness still shows through on what otherwise feels like quite a nice game. Everyone knows about the bugs, so there’s no point mentioning them more here.  The physical environments and sound design are very well set up. But the NPCs populating the world will behave in ways that might break your immersion. When a gun is fired, they will all crouch in the same animation and despawn as soon as you aren’t looking. Police will spawn in on top of you when you commit a crime and don’t put up any chase when you flee. Feels disappointing in a world constructed around the notion of constant police-gang struggle. Supposedly this is slated to be reworked in the future.
The world has some interactivity more on par with games like dishonored 2. Dialogue feels particularly strong and the story is, in my experience, engaging. 
One strange thing is the character customisation. One premise of the world building is ‘fashion over function’. How you look is supposedly as important as how you act on the world of 2077. But this is totally at odds with the actual game mechanics. You will be heavily encouraged to wear clothes for their stats, not their appearance, and that will lead to some pretty weird costume combos. It doesn’t matter much because the game is entirely first person perspective, but that begs the (controversial?) question of why have a player model at all."
Event[0],Yes red dead redemption is much better on many levels right off the bat.
Event[0],Rdr2
Event[0],"Rdr2 100%. In my opinion it’s the best/most realistic video game ever made. The only downside is it’s ruined every game I’ve played after it. Either the graphics look terrible, the story is dumb, gaming mechanics aren’t as good etc.."
Event[0],"Hands down, RDR2. While I enjoyed Cyberpunk for what it is, I don't think that's a close call by almost any metric."
Event[0],"Red Dead Redemption 2 by far; I 100% Cyberpunk 2077, I did not 100% Red Dead.  Cyberpunk doesn't not have a lot of depth, unfortunately, its presentation is good and certainly has gotten better since launch but literally the only time I would even talk about it in the same breath as RDR2 is a question like yours, in terms of quality and depth and content, it doesn't hold a candle to RDR2.

There is of course a difference in setting to consider, but just keep in mind that while the 'cyberpunk' aesthetic is certainly present in Cyberpunk 2077, I'd argue it doesn't even do it as well as games like Shadowrun for SNES or Shadowrun for Genesis.  That may seem harsh, but again I did everything you could do in this game, it really doesn't have much going for it."
Event[0],RDR2
Event[0],"I would wait for the the dlc for Cyberpunk as it seems it will be some kind of mega side quest and will bring improvements to the base game as well, rdr2 is hit or miss I guess depending on people, it's a slow paced game but amazing visuals, story and immersion but with that said I finished cyberpunk and still will come back for the dlc, the game has a pretty big replayability if you like trying different approach to combat"
Event[0],"If you don't mind a slow burn for massive payoff then go for RDR2. You'll want to wait to play CP2077 until Phantom Liberty releases as they're doing an overhaul of the base game too.

Edit: Liberty not Pain"
Event[0],RDR2
Event[0],"No, it's not Next-Gen Optimized, but still RDR2 all day every day"
Event[0],"RDR2 is the superior game in my opinion. Cyberpunk is pretty bland in comparison. However, Cyberpunk has better performance in that, it can run at 60 fps on next- gen consoles (whereas RDR2 is locked at 30 fps) and is better optimized on PC, though still expect bugs. Also, RDR2 can be overwhelming with its size and detail, Cyberpunk is much smaller in scale."
Event[0],RDR 2 if you like a beautiful masterpiece
Event[0],"I just started RD2 on PC about a week ago and it’s absolutely sensational.

I do plan on getting CP after the new DLC comes out tho, and after I finish the main story in RD2!"
Event[0],You like computers or cowboys?
Event[0],"Seems like they’re going to add lots of fixes to the new gen consoles version of cyberpunk along with the expansion, so I think you should play RDR2 until a much better version of cyberpunk is out."
Event[0],RDR2.
Event[0],Red Dead Redemption 2
Event[0],"Wait for the Dlc of Cyberpunk, the game will get a massive overhaul with it"
Event[0],"RDR2 is the most polished game I have ever played. The environments are highly-interactive and the world with it’s animals and people respond to you and each other in a very believable way. It’s story is an engaging epic action-drama grounded in reality. It’s extremely immersive.

CP2077 had very rough beginnings and, when I last played it late last year, that roughness still shows through on what otherwise feels like quite a nice game. Everyone knows about the bugs, so there’s no point mentioning them more here.  The physical environments and sound design are very well set up. But the NPCs populating the world will behave in ways that might break your immersion. When a gun is fired, they will all crouch in the same animation and despawn as soon as you aren’t looking. Police will spawn in on top of you when you commit a crime and don’t put up any chase when you flee. Feels disappointing in a world constructed around the notion of constant police-gang struggle. Supposedly this is slated to be reworked in the future.
The world has some interactivity more on par with games like dishonored 2. Dialogue feels particularly strong and the story is, in my experience, engaging. 
One strange thing is the character customisation. One premise of the world building is ‘fashion over function’. How you look is supposedly as important as how you act on the world of 2077. But this is totally at odds with the actual game mechanics. You will be heavily encouraged to wear clothes for their stats, not their appearance, and that will lead to some pretty weird costume combos. It doesn’t matter much because the game is entirely first person perspective, but that begs the (controversial?) question of why have a player model at all."

Event[0],Red Dead 2
Event[0],RDR2 duh. CP2077 world and setting is unlike anything I've seen before so that's why I liked it but the story and gameplay was just ok to me.
Event[0],"RD2 

Wait for cyberpunks expansion and then get it. It’s a good game on its own. Think Skyrim but in a cyberpunk setting. Yes is failed on some major systems they were supposed to have. Supposedly they are reworking a ton which will drop with the new expansion in September"
Event[0],Red Dead. Definitely Red Dead.
Event[0],RDR 2 hands down!
Event[0],rdr2 for sure!
Event[0],Rdr2
Event[0],"I might get some hate, but i enjoyed cyberpunk way more than i did rdr2. Maybe rdr2 was too tedious for me, or i didnt like the setting so much. Not sure, still a masterpiece though. 
Still id get cp2077"
Event[0],Red Dead Redemption 2
Event[0],RDR2. By a mile!
Event[0],"There has recently (as in, this weekend) been an article about the Cyberpunk DLC. Along side it is an overall of almost every system. The state its in now, Cyberpunk is *fine.* The open world feels so dead and empty, with nothing ever changing. You can stand and watch a NPC for 5 hours, and they will not move from there spot. The gunplay is fantastic, and the story is good, although that's of course subjective) I think part of that will be changing, along with the many other little tweaks they will be making, along side adding the DLC. So I would hold off. 

&#x200B;

RDR2, in contrast is amazing. The story, combat, graphics are wonderful and I don't have much bad to say about the game. My only complaint is the pacing of the story. It drags on a little to much, but at the same time, that's kind of the point? So It seems a weird complaint. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, TL;DR- Buy RDR2, Hold of on Cyberpunk until the DLC is released"
Event[0],Red dead 2. That game is forever in my heart
Event[0],"If you like RPG games, go for cyberpunk. But if you want an experience go for RDR2. Many people say that rdr2 doesn’t have a good story, but I believe that it is amazing. But I think everyone will agree that rdr2 has the best protagonist of all time, Arthur Morgan."
Event[0],[deleted]
Event[0],"It took me almost 70h to complete the main story in RDR2 that is without any side missions or free roaming.

Done the cyberpunk main story a lot of side quests and done some free roaming all under 50h"
Event[0],Both are great but I'd wait for Cyberpunk fixes and qol that come with the expansion so RDR2 first
Event[0],"RDR2 is probably the better made game but I also loved Cyberpunk, it’s story, and it felt very creative and new. I liked someone else’s idea of doing RDR2 and buy Cyberpunk when DLC comes out so you can transition straight to DLC"
Event[0],"I completed cyberpunk 3x with lowered graphics and shit fps. (Roll on phantom liberty with a 3080)

I didnt finish RDR2s first? Second? Act.

Dont get me wrong, I think RDR2 is an amazing game, probably the better one, but these are the facts lol."
Event[0],Rdr2.  Then In September you can get CP when it gets somewhat overhauled by developers
Event[0],Why is that even a question? RDR2 should be the default answer to this.
Event[0],Get both honestly. They are both masterpieces of games. I personally enjoy Cyberpunk a lot more but they are both fantastic in terms of story and gameplay.
Event[0],Cp 2077
Event[0],"I'd go with RDR2 first and, depending on how much free time you have, by the time you're done with it there'll probably be some version of Cyberpunk with Phantom Liberty included. Either way you'll have a great time with both, enjoy!"
Event[0],"I admit that rdr2 is the better made game,  I just got bored by it.  Cyberpunk was way more fun and engaging to me. I played on a pretty good pc, and didn't really have any expectations going into the game,  so I wasn't soured by anything.

Rockstar games kinda just bore me tbh. After playing the ps2 gta games to death,  any Rockstar game after just feels like it plays the exact same."
Event[0],I love Cyberpunk and never had bug issues. You should 100% get red dead as it’s probably the best game ever created.
Event[0],Red Dead Redemption 2 is already a complete game. Cyberpunk still needs polishing and should be even more solid after the expansion comes out in September. RDR2 will hold you until then.
Event[0],"if u have a series console, ps5, or high end pc, get cyberpunk for 30$ plus the expansion for another 30$. if u don't have that, then id say RDR2"
Event[0],"Have both and played both.  
RDR2 is super immersive and so finely tuned - but it is an open world Rockstar game so it's going to be a bit overwhelming, at least it was to me.  
Cyberpunk is also open world but a bit more linear.  It has that Skyrim like maneuverability where things can get wonky but it allows the player more freedom. 

I'd say go for cyberpunk and just play it now so you have an understanding of the game and story before the dlc comes out."
Event[0],"I have both.

Cyberpunk is more of RPG style than RDR2. There's skill points and such to distribute. RDR2 increases stats for you based on what you do.

Cyberpunk's AI have health bars, red dead's doesn't. It's more immersive for that reason.

RDR2 is much slower pace, but has a lot more to explore. The scenery can be breath-taking and sometimes hard to fathom how good it looks. 

Cyberpunk has a lot of nothing, but it still looks pretty cool. Nice graphics.

So far, I like cyberpunk's story but it can seem a bit all over the place.

RDR2 has been easier to follow."
Event[0],"If you just want a decent story with an immersive world and nice graphics, RDR2 is fine for that. It has pretty terrible gameplay, and it's a brain-dead easy game that treats players like they have 60 IQ. If you just want to turn off your brain for 60-hours and play through a decent story, then it fits the bill. Especially if you like the wild west and spaghetti western movies, then you will probably like RDR2. 

Cyberpunk has way better art direction than RDR2, but the game is severely lacking in terms of a lot of its open world systems. It has nowhere near as immersive of an open world as RDR2. The setting and visuals are a lot cooler, but the actual execution isn't there. The combat is not very good, but it's at least better than RDR2 in this area. It also has RPG systems and build variety which RDR2 doesn't have. Overall I'd say just wait until the DLC drops, because apparently they have reworked a lot of aspects of the game. CP2077 really does have a lot of potential, so if the DLC lives up to the hype, then it could be a game changer."
Event[0],I just tried cyberpunk a couple weeks ago off a freinds familyshare and its still super buggy to the point where i wound up getting fed up with the bugs and uninstalling. I would have felt very cheated if it was a game i payed for. So i would go with RDR2
Event[0],"Everyone says RDR2 is the best game ever, but the janky controls are super frustrating and honestly it’s pretty slow at times. I don’t need to watch long animations every time I pick something up or do anything. It’s more cowboy sim than game. 

Tried it 3 times and never make it past 10 hrs or so."
Event[0],[deleted]
Event[0],Both
Event[0],Mount a blade bannerlord has great rpg mechanics you can literally be anything in that world
Event[0],I would only choose Cyberpunk solely because it has next gen support. RDR2 is a fantastic game but lacks that kind of support which makes me personally not touch it ever since I beat it back in 2018.
Event[0],"RDR2. It’s a much more immersive game and story. Cyberpunk is a great game too, but I don’t find the story as good at all. The pros about cyberpunk are extreme weapon customization and playstyle customization with perk trees. When I play RDR2 I feel like I’m in the story, and when I play Cyberpunk I feel like I’m in a gigantic beautiful sandbox game."
Event[0],Cyberpunk
Event[0],"RDR2 is much more story rich and interactive compared to cyberpunk. It only takes around 30 hours to complete the main mission, spoiler alert ( when doing the last mission after doing so you get back to prior of starting the last mission to finish anything else to basically you don't fully finish it). It has nice features, ray tracing, and a nice environment, but RDR2 beats it in every other way. That's from my opinion as i have both and played both for 100 hours plus on each."
Event[0],"Cyberpunk has better writing and combat. Rdr2's world is more detailed, alive and polished. 
I prefer cyberpunk.
Most people seem to prefer rdr2."
Event[0],"RDR2. Ive played both and Cyberpunk really lacks in a lot of areas and i didn’t get much enjoyment from it after completing the main story line. RDR2 however is a game that ive replayed numerous times and spent upwards of 400 hours combined playing, most of it in free roam. Havent even touched the online yet."
Event[0],"Cyberpunk's DLC will remain as a DLC, it seems to be set in a new city, but at this point, nothing can be done about the game's dullness and how unfun it is to play. I played it for 25 hours(right until the 3-race side mission were unlocked), and it's just boring, the plot is mediocre, the fighting, the gameplay are subpar, the only redeeming thing was how beautiful everything looked, and that's it"
Event[0],I would be cautious with RDR2 on PC. I had to get a refund on it due to the game constantly crashing; the issues had to do specifically with the Rockstar games launcher which you are required to use.
Event[0],"Rdr2 is a bit of an ancient game in terms of design. Missions force you to do things one way and if you don’t listen the game fails you. It’s also an aggressively easy game that just feels stiff and clunky mechanics wise. It’s got great voice acting, but I found the world and story pretty dull. Cyberpunk is a far more enjoyable game that gives you choices on how to handle each mission with much better combat and a much more interesting world to explore and a far more interesting story."
Event[0],"This is a hard one, gotta do both haha"
Event[0],neither buy rain world 😈😈
Event[0],RDR2 no contest
Event[0],"Depends, if you're on console I would skip RDR2, it still runs at 30FPS, rockstar doesn't care about next gen update."
Event[0],"Neither, buy doom eternal"
Event[0],I dont like rdr2 at all and like project red games
Event[0],Cyberpunk. Red dead 2 is overrated imo
Event[0],They’re both great go with what interests you more.
Event[0],I've played both and I have some stronger critiques on RD2 than most but would still pick it over CP.
Event[0],"Both games are amazing, i loved Cyberpunk it's story characters, scenery. currently playing RDR2 its really good, both games are great. I'd buy both if i were u"
Event[0],Robots and guns or cowboys and guns
Event[0],"I’d go for Cyberpunk personally. The game is really good as long as you take your time and do the side quests. There are a ton of really compelling stories that get told. I’d wait to play until Phantom Liberty releases though. The gameplay is already good, but it’s rumored they’re going to be shipping big improvements to key systems like the AI and the police systems (and possibly more) with the DLC."
Event[0],I recommend getting both
Event[0],"Both are incredible story games, depends on what you want. If you care about story and characters, go red dead, if you care about combat and replay ability go cyberpunk"
Event[0],"Rdr2, 100000%"
Event[0],Cyberpunk if you want action. Red dead if you don't mind watching a movie in game format.
Event[0],Rdr2 cyberpunk has a lot of problems
Event[0],RDR2
Event[0],Red dead partner!
Event[0],Red Dead is the better game hands down.
Event[0],RDR2
Event[0],Do you want to be a cowboy? If so…follow your heart
Event[0],Cyberpunk has a big DLC coming soon.
Event[0],"With the Phantom Liberty expansion, which overhaul all of cyberpunk. It will great to buy...


But RDR2 is a moderm masterpiece so it gets my vote"
Event[0],"Cyberpunk is more action and adrenaline, Red Dead Redemption 2 is more laid back and slow-paced.  


Cyberpunk has been getting updates continually since release and is awesomely upgraded by this point...I never finished RDR2, but I finished Cyberpunk and am waiting at the edge of my seat for Phantom Liberty, which is going to be a *huge* DLC and should be later this year.  


Cyberpunk.  My two cents."
Event[0],"RDR2, it's much more detailed and alive rather than cyberprank, tho I enjoyed cyberprank (played from friend's console) its just not within the same level of RDR2 also the balancing of story telling and action on RDR2 is peak unlike in cyberpunk you're always just sitting and listening"
Event[0],I don’t usually post on reddit but i just want to make sure that you get RDR2
Event[0],"Both are great, but I think Cyberpunk is the more engaging game. Red Dead suffers from the antiquated Rockstar game design. Almost no freedom during missions, you’re just railroaded through each section and must play it as the developers intend."
Event[0],Red dead 2 is my pick. Cyberpunk was fun but i can’t just sit back and enjoy the world like i can with RDr2
Event[0],"In my opinion, Red Dead Redemption 2 was an incredible experience, especially in the beginning and middle game. However, I found myself getting bored after reaching around 60% completion, as there weren't many new things to explore once I had acquired the best weapon. 

On the other hand, Cyberpunk had superior writing and enjoyable gameplay, but it did suffer from some noticeable bugs."
Event[0],"RDR2 and anyone who says diff is crazy ive completed both games and theres just nothing that compares to RDR2 everything about it is so amazing but for me my fav thing about the game was the story telling. the best storytelling ive ever experienced in a game hands down. it could of been a oscar winning film. i literally cryed during a few scenarios in the game,"
Event[0],Lol EASY choice. RDR2.
Event[0],Are you on pc ? If you don’t wanna keep the games forever. I can tell you how to get them for like 2$ both on steam
Event[0],"I vote rdr, as well. BUT, if you haven't played Witcher 3, that's another great one. Plus, it often heavily discounted."
Event[0],RDR2 and its not even close
Event[0],"Red dead 2. There isn’t a game that has immersed me more than this game, I play butt nekkid and pretend I’m a O’Driscol. 10 Cowboys out of 10"
Event[0],"I’ve played both and loved both, but I fully believe that RDR2 is truly the best game ever, go with that first!"
Event[0],"Rdr2 is very pretty and has some interesting things in it but from a gameplay perspective it's unbelievably barren. You don't even get to aim your gun in this game really and all the missions are basically ""walk here, listen to dialogue, kill guys"".

Cyberpunk at least has some depth to combat. It's a passable first person shooter. Not a great one mind you, but it works. The missions here are also just ""walk here, listen to dialogue, kill guys"".

Personally the dialogue in both these games puts me to sleep and that's like 70% of both. But I guess I would say the Rdr2 dialogue at least feels finished, whereas the cyberpunk dialogue very frequently feels like a placeholder."
Event[0],RDR 2 is a no brainer in this case
Event[0],"Cyberpunk over RDR2. While RDR2 is a great game, i found it slow, and alot of the “immersive” mechanics being pretty surface level and just boring. Unpopular take, but Cyberpunk is more fun."
Event[0],I’d wait till the new expansion for CP2077 comes out. It’s supposed to bring a whole bunch of QOL changes to the base game.
Event[0],RDR2
Event[0],No
Event[0],"RDR2 was fun, but I was more hyped for Cyberpunk 2077. Ended up not caring for RDR2 so much after burning myself out on it, but Cyberpunk absolutely failed me in almost every department. RDR2 is the way to go."
Event[0],"Wait for the cyberpunk dlc to drop before you buy since they are redoing A LOT of the mechanics. I believe it’s September 26 so you have a lot of time to finish red dead. Plus the summer sale is soonish I think so you might be able to get the game and dlc for cheap depending on what price they set. 

I’ve played both and even though it’s been a while since I played cyberpunk and I just finished red dead 3 days ago both are excellent games in their own right but I’d probably play red dead before cyberpunk."
Event[0],**\*\*\* me scrolling through the comments to find the crazy psychopath that chooses cyberpunk over rdr2 \*\*\***
Event[0],Cyberpunk is fun but it doesn’t come close to RDR2.
Event[0],"It depends on what type of games you like, red dead is more story based and polished, but cyberpunk is more ""fuck around and break the game"", but in a good way

Cyberpunk has leveling and a skill tree, and rdr doesn't, so I think you'd like it more

Also red dead was built with miracles or something because it runs like a dream"
Event[0],[removed]
Event[0],Both games are really good but RDR2 is my favourite game all time so pick RDR2
Event[0],"Both are great, but RDR2 is looong but with lots of content"
Event[0],Rdr2
Event[0],Cyberpunk is more fun. RDR2 gets crazy tedious
Event[0],"Red Dead 2 is worth its weight in gold. The story is perfectly told, with some of the best voice acting I've ever heard in a video game. The world is vast, and you never feel like you're completely out of things to do. Bored of missions? Hunt some animals for upgrades to both your player or your camp. Tired of hunting? Put your criminal mind to robbing a store or train. Want to help the law? Check the local sheriff's office for a bounty. The list of activities goes on and on...


So to answer your question, take a break from the cybernetics and neon signs of Night City and go on a breathtaking journey through late 1800's America with Dutch Van der Linde and the gang!"
Event[0],"Go with red dead and play cyberpunk after the last dlc comes out. There will probably some sale for a definitive edition down the line.

Both games are definitely worth to be played."
Event[0],Do you prefer cowboys or cyborgs
Event[0],Finished Rdr2 3 times already and would pay 200$to forget everything and start the game again without remembering anything. Cyberpunk I enjoyed the story but the game was full of bugs and lost the interest of playing it again even if it is fixed or not
Event[0],"I played red dead 2 after it had been out for like 4 years not expecting much. I didn't even buy it, I played my brothers copy, that's the only reason I tried it. It turned out to be my favorite game ever. I'm not particularly interested in the wild west. It felt like watching a movie in the best way possible. It's the only game I can think of where I was sad because I knew it was ending soon. I can't recommend it enough.

I was excited for cyberpunk for years. I was incredibly disappointed when I finally was able to play it, I put about 20 hours in it and feel no urge to continue playing it. Even after they've patched it."
Event[0],"All you need to do is listen to the song ""Video games"" by Tenacious D. You're welcome."
Event[0],RDR2. Cyberpunk's getting totally reworked head to toe alongside new DLC in September and *that's* when you should buy it.
Event[0],RDR2
Event[0],rdr2
Event[0],RDR2!
Event[0],Hmph. Rdr2 is a masterpiece. Cyberpunk quite literally is bad. Phantom liberty sounds very promising on paper but we’ll have to see. So did this game pre release and I’d give it a 5/10.
Event[0],Is this post by OP a joke?
Event[0],RDR2
Event[0],"Rdr2 has a much stronger plot and cast. And the world is gorgeous.

Cyberpunk is also fantastic and a lot of fun, BUT it’s a lot more you having to role play the character"
Event[0],"Loved both, but like everyone has already said, start with RDR2. CP2077 is a fantastic game, but it will get better once the Phantom Liberty update comes out."
Event[0],Rdr2 all day. By far my fav game all time.. online sux d tho.
Event[0],I couldn't get into RDR2 personally. I was enjoying the story and it's the most beautiful game ever made but I thought the gameplay and controls were so rudimentary I stopped at Chapter 3. Meanwhile I really liked Cyberpunk especially the story and although its gameplay isn't groundbreaking it didn't stop me from finishing the game.
Event[0],"Red dead, no doubt."
Event[0],RDR2 is one of the best games humanity has ever witnessed
Event[0],"Most people are saying RD2, but my vote is for Cyberpunk. Bugs aren't as bad now, and the story is great. Along with a bunch of different builds. You can be a ninja with a katana, a run and gun madman, or a tech savvy hacker. The atmosphere is great and helps tie everything together, and the characters you meet really make it amazing. Just like all of CDPR's games, they really go all out with side quests and side story characters. Plus, Phantom Liberty releases in September, so if it's on sale, I would go for it. Cyberpunk is by far one of my favorites, and honestly, RD2 doesn't even get close to my top games.
That being said, both Cyberpunk and RD2 are both amazing games. I just lean more towards Cyberpunk."
Event[0],"I say pick up Cyberpunk, it might be worthwhile to play the game now, with the original story, before playing Phantom Liberty. As Phantom Liberty is very likely going to come with some new endings, and possibly some other changes outside the ones we already know.

Plus I just think its a good game, well worth the money nowadays after 1.5. Mods make it even more fun to play around with. Just an entertaining experience.

On top of that Cyberpunk is truly an RPG, it lets you choose your skills, pick different perks, use different weapons. You truly build your character the way you want. Its very similar to thinks likeSkyrim in that way. Where as Red Dead 2 is just the same character no matter what, there is no leveling system or anything. Its really more of an action adventure title than a true RPG. 

So if you want to get immersed into an RPG and its setting, in similar fashion to things like Skyrim, I recommend 2077."
Event[0],RDR2 with no hesitation and do not read spoilers.
Event[0],"Hey unpopular opinion time. I played both.

RDR2 is certainly a marvel. The story is amazing, graphics are second to none, the protagonist is probably the most well flushed out I've ever experienced in a game, and overall the game really is a must play.

....but it's a bit of a drag yeah? It's very slow paced, and I found myself just wanting to play other games from time to time. This isn't really a negative point, and is definitely subjective, but man it can DRAG. 



Cyberpunk (post patches) is a wild ride. The story is a blast, and really kicks. The set pieces are way above what I expected in an open world game. The side quests, as expected from CDPR are just as good, if not better than the main story in many cases. Definitely a case of art direction trumping graphical fidelity. While it doesn't look bad by any stretch... Walking though Chinatown in the middle of the night is a sight to behold. Vibrant neon lighting, crowded streets, some guy getting mugged in an alley, the constant cacophony of people shouting and talking... I haven't felt that level of immersion in a game... Maybe ever.

Yeah it's a bit of a mess. But way better than the sum of its parts. Unfortunately I listened to the online griping, and missed out for longer than necessary, but take from someone who was hesitant, it blew me away.

At the end of the day Cyberpunk is just ***fun***. The shooting is chunky and effective, the driving is arcady but feels good, the plot and characters are fucking bonkers, and there really are just so many ways to play the game.

I played it the first time as a learning curve. A little hacking, a little shotgun, a little melee. It was pure chaos and really felt like I was a newbie in night city trying to climb to the top.

Second time thru and I'm playing full stealth. Feels like a totally different game. I walk in an alley, activate my speed implant, turn invisible, and walk through putting a bullet in everyone's head. Come out the other side, and watch the bodies drop before the cameras ever had a chance to catch me. Suddenly I felt like an elite level assassin that was born and bred in this world.


You can't go wrong either way, but I tip towards CP"
Event[0],"cyberpunk, rdr2 is a linear game in an open world setting with the most boring chapter 1 in existence, also everything you do (pointless animation) is so slow and infuriating that you can fall asleep"
Event[0],I think rdr2 has more replayability if that matter to you as far as stretching your dollar. I dont find myself excitingly opening cyberpunk. I felt like 1 playthrough was enough to get a big grasp of the game.
Event[0],"Rdr2 is a masterpiece. It’s slow paced but if you adapt your speed to it, rather than trying to force it to your speed, it’s fantastic! It is the most alive environment of any game I’ve played. Can interact with just about everything too. And npc’s actually seem like they are more than objects moving around the screen."
Event[0],RDR2 is one of the greatest games ever made.
Event[0],"I have both. The answer is both. Just get both, play them both for less than two-hours each, and refund the one you don’t want."
Event[0],"Unquestionably RDR2 is the better, more fully realized game. 

I think the best question to answer from a prospective standpoint, however, is what is your preferred gaming experience? Do you like 'slow' as a concept? Do you enjoy being diverted from whatever you initially planned doing? If a game world is both fun and immersive, are you happy with killing an hour or two wandering around it and not focusing on story progression? If yes to all of the above, You will love RDR2. If you are very task oriented and want everything to be a quick hit, then RDR2 isn't going to be your cup of tea regardless of its (excellent) level of quality.

That's generally what people mean when they say this game is divisive. The less patient get frustrated with its deliberateness."
Event[0],Wait until the Cyberpunk expansion comes out at a discount. It will probably be in its best state at that point.
Event[0],"Red Dead 2 all the way. It took me like 3 attempts of replaying the beginning before I finally got hooked on the game and I wish it didn’t cause I’ve been missing out! 

It’s such a beautiful game. The guns are dope, (just experiment, you can’t lose unless you don’t like the gun which you can just store away) and the world is vast but alive

Like you’ll suddenly get ambushed or some fools will try to rob you; or woodcutters are felling trees, or a criminal is complaining on the back of a horse tied up"
Event[0],I played both RDR2 on s a great experience but a little slower pace. Cyberpunk was broke and I fell off before I completed it
Event[0],"Both are on sale pretty often but I would do RDR2 first without question. There are certain games you absolutely have to at least play. Don’t have to finish it if it don’t click but it’s an absolute must play. Cyberpunk is a great story with not the best gameplay, plus very raunchy. It’s gotten much better over the years however."
Event[0],Red dead 2 is leagues better imo
Event[0],Rdr2 is probably the best story in a game I have ever played. Full stop. It is genuinely one of the most amazing game stories there is. I would recommend it over cyberpunk based on that alone
Event[0],Red Dead 1st by far
Event[0],"Imo they are both very enjoyable from a story and gameplay angle. Some of it comes to taste (do you want a Wild West game or futuristic urban environment?). In my opinion you can’t go wrong but there is a reason Red Dead 2 is considered one of the greatest single player games of all time. 


Also, if this matters, cyberpunk is a 30-50 hour game if you complete the story and do a lot of side quests. Red dead 2 is more of a 50+ hour kind of game."
Event[0],RDR2
Event[0],I would say red dead now and cyberpunk later
Event[0],"Cause I don't play video games no more
Never play video games
But Red Dead Redemption 2, that is not a game
It's an incredible journey through old American history
Fighting for your life and fighting for your family
Try to live your days with honor and integrity
That's not a game, that's an adult thing
That's not a game at all
That's like fuckin' Shakespeare
- Jack Black"
Event[0],"Objectively RDR2 is the better game in almost every way, and it’s also cheaper right now. But man I can’t help but absolutely adore cyberpunk, even more than red dead. My brain says get red dead but my heart says get cyberpunk"
Event[0],"Cyberpunk is pretty cool, but RDR2 is a goddamn masterpiece."
Event[0],"If you like first person action RPG and sci -fi allot like I do Cyberpunk carried the magic. After the millionth plot twist I gave up on Rdr2, cyberpunk is short sweet and tragic."
Event[0],I would say get red dead. It honestly looks like the better game out of the two and you can always get a refund if you really don't like it.
Event[0],"Red dead 2, 100%"
Event[0],Could not put RDR2 down finished in under a month. Cyberpunk took me at least 4.
Event[0],99.9% of time my answer to this sub is just r/piratedgames
Event[0],rdr2 all the way
Event[0],Red Dead Redemption 2 !
Event[0],Rdr 2
Event[0],Both are amazing and should be played but get rdr2 first and wait till the new dlc to get cyberpunk.
Event[0],"RDR2 is to date the best single game I’ve ever played by far.

It’s a masterpiece."
Event[0],RDR2. Without a doubt.
Event[0],RDR2
Event[0],Do you want rootin tootin cowboy shootin or stressy messy cyborg depressy?
Event[0],"I love both, but cyberpunk is good and RDR2 is next level amazing."
Event[0],"In between missions, RDR2 is quite therapeutic to play."
Event[0],"Late to the party, but would like to share my thoughts:

CP2077 has some fantastic writing and beautiful graphics. That being said, it’s a very shallow game in every other department. Given the world-building, it has amazing potential. If they had just given the game another couple years to incubate, it easily could’ve been one of the greatest action-adventure RPGs of its time. 

RDR2 is, on the other hand, *also* a game that has fantastic writing and beautiful graphics. It is, however, the type of game that *did* get the time it needed to fully flesh out all the other aspects of its gameplay. The result is a highly immersive experience with a lot of replayability and content that can last you hundreds of hours."
Event[0],"It's not even really a fair comparison. 

RDR2 is a ridiculous rich and developed world with unbelievable detail (sometimes to much) and a story that is extremely engaging. It also has some of the best NPC reactions/interactions and is probably one of the top 3 hunting games in the last decade all rolled into one.

Cyberpunk is a mostly dead world with poor interactivity with npcs, a convoluted story that barely makes sense, and is almost entirely empty. I know I mentioned dead and empty twice but it needed repeating. The game had so much potential it didn't live up to its ridiculous. The games AI is almost as bad as basic vanilla skyrim back in the day. Luckily most of the bugs seem to have been dealt with but the game is still not worth buying in my opinion"
Event[0],I've played both. They're both pretty good. Rdr2 is the best of the 2.
Event[0],def red dead!
Event[0],I have never met someone who didnt like rdr2 but cyberpunk seems to be hit or miss i have friends who love it but i have had no enjoyment playing it at all
Event[0],"Cyberpunk is one of my all-time favourites, but Red Dead II is objectively the GOAT"
Event[0],RDR 2 and don't think twice. Cyberpunk is good but RDR2 is a masterpiece and goated.
Event[0],"I haven't played Cyberpunk yet, but RDR2 is a must play. I held off on playing RDR2 for a long time, due to people saying its slow paced. That was a mistake. I didn't feel slow to me, because the story is so good. If it was a movie, it would get an Oscar."
Event[0],Rdr2 first and then cyberpunk
Event[0],RDR2 no contest
Event[0],RDR2 is at minimum a top 10 all time must play game
Event[0],Red dead is wayyyy better than cyber.
Event[0],"10/10 ""wild west"" (kind of) open world with a 10/10 story or a, well, cyberpunk open world with a 9,5/10 story


your call"
Event[0],"Rdr2 is amazing. Cyberpunk is great and one of the better open world games I've played ever. I've played a lot of games and I adore this game. Wasn't perfect obviously with the console bugs but it's still great. If you're on pc then get it,next gen consoles then yeah. Previous gen then definitely no. 

After playing both, I can say both are great and damn good games. RDR2 is a masterpiece and Cyberpunk could one day end up being remembered as one. If not for the bugs and launch issues then kt would've been perfect imo"

Event[0],"Cyberpunk is one of the more fun games I've played in years.  Red dead redemption 2 is the single greatest game I've ever played. Play both, but start with red dead."
Event[0],How much is rdr2? I just bought it for $70? 😭😭😭😭
Event[0],Anyone who is a gamer must play RDR2
Event[0],Cyberpunk. That's just me though. This is really a question you need to ask yourself.
Event[0],"Well I would say both, but I would suggest leaving cyberpunk aside until Phantom Liberty comes out and you can experience it at its highest. So for now, I recommend Red Dead. It's very fun, finished it recently, couldn't put my controller down, one week of my holiday gone, spent 110 hours on the game. Just don't overwhelm yourself and don't rush too much with the story, just enjoy the game's atmosphere and its randomness and progress in the story in whatever way feels best to you.

If you worry about completionism, I recommend making a manual save for everytime you start a new chapter."
Event[0],Cyberpunk has finally gotten out of the shadow of its launch and is finally the game it was promised to be. But RDR 2 would be Rockstar’s masterpiece if the first game and GTA V didn’t already exist. Definitely check both games out but give Red Dead Redemption 2 a try first.
Event[0],I liked Cyberpunk a lot but RDR2 is the way to go
Event[0],Cyberpunk only because it going to get a overhaul that makes the game worth playing but red dead 2 is hella fun as well so wouldn't blame you if you got that over it since cyberpunk started off bad and kept people off it.
Event[0],RDR2. It has an amazing story.
Event[0],I haven't played Cyberpunk but RDR2 is such a masterpiece so that's my vote :)
Event[0],Red Dead Redemption is a masterpiece. Cyberpunk in its current state is fine but nowhere near RDR2 level.
Event[0],RDR2
Event[0],"I played both, and 110% would pick RDR2 over cyberpunk. I think I’ve replayed it 4 times now. Played through Cyberpunk once and haven’t felt much like going back. Just a richer story in RDR2."
Event[0],"i know everyone and their mom has already said it in this comment section, but i’m gonna add my voice to the choir anyways: rdr2 first, without a doubt."
Event[0],RDR2 is great. would never spend money on cyberjunk
Event[0],Rdr2 is slow as fuck cyberpunk is fast paced so i would go for cyberpunk (haven't been a fan of slow paced walking and riding Sims no matter how good the story is if they can't give it to me in a faster manner or keep me retained i ain't bout that)
Event[0],RDR 2
Event[0],"Wow, someone needs to rep cyberpunk here.  I loved it.  Best game of last 5 years for me.

Rdr2 was boring for me.  Scenery was pretty and all but I just found it repetitive.  Ride horse, shoot, do boring camp stuff, etc.  I dunno I like doing that stuff in real life.  

Cyberpunk is just super fun.  The soundtrack bangs.. you get swords implanted in your arms... the lore is super interesting.. lots of meaningful choices.  It's the only game I've ever replayed 

CP got a bad rap at launch.  I get it.  But on PS5 today it rocks"
Event[0],"Cyberpunk will have a GOTY edition either with Phantom Liberty’s release or shortly thereafter. Acquiring RDR2 right now makes more sense, at least to me."
Event[0],Buy rdr2 and when cyberpunk gets a complete edition buy that one later on
Event[0],Both are incredible. I would not recommend getting Cyberpunk on a PS4 as it just stops working for me after like an hour of play time. RDR2 is a considerably better game but both are worth it
Event[0],"Play RDR, then go to the second one - you won't regret it."
Event[0],"I'm playing Cyberpunk rn and while id say it is a very good game and looks incredible, it is still nowhere near as polished as RDR2, combat, movement, interactions, npcs, customization and most of the things that make an open world/exploration game good are better in RDR2 in my opinion. But id still recommend you to get Cyberpunk later, it is a great game."
Event[0],"Red dead 2, Cyberpunk isn't bad now, but RDR2 still has a good case for being the best game of all time."
Event[0],I would get RDR2 first. Its long game with a much better story imo. Plus cyberpunk is getting that expansion in a few months that'll be overhauling some gameplay mechanics.
Event[0],Cyberpunk.
Event[0],"Red dead’s storymode is god tier, online can be amazing, Cyberpunk is very good, Perosnally I’d say red dead if you’ll play the online, cyberpunk if ur not gonna play the online"
Event[0],"I say it depends on your system. I have a PS4 slim and cyberpunk is unplayable after the last large update. Gonna have to get a ps5 to actually play it. Could be my save corrupted somehow, but the game freezes after 20 minutes almost religiously."
Event[0],RDR2 is one the best video games ever made. Definitely go for that first.
Event[0],RDR2 any day of the week.
Event[0],"Play RDR2 first and then buy Cyberpunk when the new expansion drops. I love both games, but it sounds like CP2077: Phantom Liberty will be the definitive edition"
Event[0],"I would recommend both, but you need to play RDR2 if you haven't first"
Event[0],Red dead redemption 2 a million times over cyberpunk
Event[0],"RDR2, absolutely."
Event[0],"I think cyberpunk and the expansion are on sale right now. But I’d go for rdr2 first considering it will be more instant gratification then having to wait till December for the expansion on cyberpunk, which will have a ton of new content meant to make the experience way better."
Event[0],"Cyberpunk is poorly written, rdr2 is a masterclass"
Event[0],RDR2 by a mile
Event[0],"I played both games this year. I haven't finished Cyberpunk yet but it's pretty fun, I love everything about it except for some game breaking bugs and funny braindead AI. Both games are great but RDR2 is a triump; storytelling, characters, sound design, voice acting and impressive life-like world with a lot of details and hidden gems in it although gameplay is your standard Rockstar game, it's still an immersive game."
Event[0],"I would recommend that you never buy cyberpunk and if Red dead is your thing, go for it. (It’s not my thing. But seriously, don’t buy cyberpunk.)"
Event[0],Definitely Red Dead Redemption 2. Best game i have ever played since 2006
Event[0],"huge cyberpunk fan here, i'd probably buy it when phantom liberty comes out since they're overhauling everything. RDR2 however was a masterpiece when it came out. definitely grab it, especially if on sale"
Event[0],RDR2 will make you question if any game you ever played was good at all.
Event[0],"Fair warning. I also say RDR2, BUT you need to go into it realizing it IS intentionally slower paced. Take your time with it, really invest in the characters and just hang out in the world, exploring and such. However, that said, I absolutely LOVE RDR2. It’s my favorite of all time."
Event[0],Rdr2
Event[0],"Both are really good 

I really enjoyed RDR2 a lot but Cyberpunk has something that really made me love it. 

I don't know if it's the setting or the overall dystopian world but it's a really great experience now

Plus Phantom Liberty is coming in september I believe so it might be worth a try"
Event[0],"Both are on par and considered masterpieces of their own, CP story is more complex and fast paced while RDR2 is more of a slow burn kind of story. I think that CP is the superior game but I think you should buy both."
Event[0],"Imo RDR2 is superior in essentially every aspect, I would definitely try it out."
Event[0],Get both
Event[0],"Definitely RDR2, seriously it contains the best protagonist you’ll ever play."
Event[0],"Red dead is a must - cyberpunk is a should, so play RDR 2 first, then when the DLC is out pick up cyberpunk"
Event[0],RDR2. I played both but for me RDR2 is just better.
Event[0],"RDR2 barring it’s online is easily one of the best games ever made in my opinion. Same goes for RDR1, which can be played in either order. On top of that there’s undead nightmare as an added plus"
Event[0],"I love both. But if I had to choose, it would be RDR2"
Event[0],"Honestly both are really great games, you should pick based on what type of world you would like to dive into. Dystopian future, vs movie western."
Event[0],Rdr2 killed my parents. We’re happily married now.
Event[0],"RDR2 for sure!!!! I'm playing it again right now. Easily in my top 10 greatest games of all time. And with the amount of games I've played over 30+ years, that is really saying something."
Event[0],Honestly they are both amazing In their own rights. RDR2 is considered one of the best games of all time tho so it’s an easy pick
Event[0],"Obvious answer is rdr 2 first, but let me say this. No open world game will ever be the same after rdr2. Its miles ahead any game ive played to this day, technically and story wise."
Event[0],"Both games are amazing. You can't go wrong with either - great storyline, great side quests, you can just dig yourself in for hours and hours. I'd highly recommend both. But if I had to pick one, I'd say RDR2. It left a bigger impression on me after finishing it."
Event[0],"RDR2 is probably the better game from a technical standpoint, but I found the controls kind of kludgy to be honest.  I beat it once and have never felt the desire to replay it.

Cyberpunk on the other hand is the kind of game I can beat then immediately want to start a new character.  Yeah, it's undoubtably not as polished, but I just had more fun with it.  (Again, a big part of this probably just comes back to the controls, which were a lot smoother in Cyberpunk.)

Honestly...  You should just  get them BOTH!"
Event[0],Rdr2 is easily the greatest console game ever made
Event[0],"They’re very different games which is something to bare in mind. However, RDR2 is a much more polished product. I’d play that first and then pick up 2077/Phantom Liberty because they have basically said that the entire game is getting overhauled and polished with the next update/DLC in September. Both games will grip you emotionally as they’re very well written"
Event[0],I played through cyberpunk twice. I stopped playing RDR2 when I got bored of riding my horsey.
Event[0],Cyberpunk. Honestly RDR2 kind of bored me
Event[0],And I will play it. Thanks for the reply.
Event[0],Yeah what else is there to say? Although Cyberpunk is very enjoyable
Event[0],I would say portal is a triumph.
Event[0],"Sure, I guess then RDR2 it is. Thanks for the reply."
Event[0],I won't pass on either but I guess first I will go through RDR2. Thanks for the reply.
Event[0],I didn't feel the same. What is so unmissable about red dead for you?
Event[0],To be honest it really depends. Personally I felt Red dead was a little to realistic for me and Cyber punk was more actiony.
Event[0],">It will give you a thrill, make you feel like a badass, and then leave you in tears.

beautifully said."
Event[0],Yes.
Event[0],Same here it's hard to get into other games since I've played rdr2 I keep going back to it.
Event[0],"Yeah, I guess waiting for the new update and dlc is the best option as new things will be added along with overhauls. Thanks for the reply."
Event[0],What kind of depth does rdr2 have?
Event[0],"Yeah. I just saw the dlc as pre-order along with Cyberpunk, but I think it will not be a great idea to buy it as they are adding and overhauling some features of the game in the next update probably. I guess waiting atleast till the update will be the right choice. Thanks for the reply."
Event[0],I’ve just started the game is it best to wait for the DLC then and when does it drop ?
Event[0],Phantom Pain is Metal Gear Solid. Cyberpunk 2077's expansion is called Phantom Liberty.
Event[0],Do you know if ultimate version of RDR2 is worth it?
Event[0],Any other game similar to rdr2 in gameplay? I love the sort of chill vibes with the option of action.
Event[0],Careful it's CP2077
Event[0],"Just a minor note that the outfit issue was fixed with a transmog function, so now you can play dress up and not just worry about stats.  But if you want to see your own outfit you have to drive a motorcycle."
Event[0],Should I finish cyberpunk before the dlc?
Event[0],"Yeah same here, RDR2 was amazing but I was way more immersed in Cyberpunk's world than RDR2's one 

Though both are really great games and should be played imo"
Event[0],"Sorry to bother, but I would also like to ask which edition of RDR2 should I get. I will tell beforehand that I don't think I will be playing online version of the game."
Event[0],I think most people agree that RDR2’s story is great and the strongest part of the game besides the visuals.
Event[0],"Bruh. Who has the audacity to say RDR2 doesn’t have a good story?

It’s been widely, widely lauded as having one of the best stories in recent years"
Event[0],"Thanks. I think story is subjective so might really like RDR2 too as I am not a huge fan of futuristic world. Though I am not a huge fan of Cowboys either (mediaeval fan here), though I might like it if I play it. Thanks for replying, I might get RDR2 now and wait for the update and expansion of Cyberpunk."
Event[0],"I don't know about the story, but the best video game character is BT-7274. Period."
Event[0],"This is how I feel. Cyberpunk was faster paced and I got more immediate gratification. I actually still haven’t gotten very far in RDR2 just because it has been slower-paced, but that being said, it is an exceptionally well-designed game"
Event[0],"You’ve just described my exact experience. I really enjoyed RDR2 but we had just had our first baby when the it released - I just didn’t have the time and it fell by the wayside as a result, so I never finished it. Cyberpunk I managed to complete several times over on PS4 Pro and one more on PS5. Every single play through I’ve played completely differently to the last. It’s been immense. The sheer variety on offer with the story and the play styles means totally different experiences each time. While Red Dead is a beautiful and epic experience - it’s a fairly unilateral one. The only real variety coming from how many side missions or how much peripheral content you want to pursue. My wife played Cyberpunk more than I did - her sessions were vastly different to mine. I haven’t seen anything quite like it since the likes of Elder Scrolls."
Event[0],“HANK! DON’T ABBREVIATE CYBERPUNK LIKE THAT! HAAAAANK!”
Event[0],Not really. Where is the single player content?
Event[0],"Same is experience. RDR2 more polished and you interact with more things, and NPC has better reactions. But cyberpunk is just more fun to play.

My biggest issue with rockstar games is that on rails and very linear. That’s being said they still quality games and will buying the next Rockstar game when it comes out."
Event[0],You can always turn off aim assist for a better challenge in RDR2
Event[0],What do you mean by terrible gameplay in RDR2?
Event[0],"Yeah, just saw the amount of things they are adding in the update and expansion. Some of it is overhaul of current systems so I guess waiting for the update and the dlc is the best thing for now. Anyways, I would like to ask one more thing, should I buy RDR2 on Epic store or Steam because as far as I have heard, Epic store has a really bad mod support for games. And I guess there some fine mods for RDR2 so would like to get my hands on them. Thanks."
Event[0],"> game i *paid* for. So

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*"
Event[0],"I played the game about a year ago and only experienced like 5 bugs, none of them even being close to game breaking"
Event[0],I bought and played a month or so ago and experienced almost 0 bugs. I think one quest messed up and that was it. After the most recent patch it seems pretty good. Also looks amazing with the ray tracing.
Event[0],">the janky controls are super frustrating and honestly it’s pretty slow at times. I don’t need to watch long animations every time I pick something up or do anything. It’s more cowboy sim than game.  
>  
>Tried it 3 times and never make it past 10 hrs or so.

Not every game is made for you."
Event[0],you think cyberpunk is a fail because of first week youtube videos and headlines. mostly everyone that plays the game says it is on track to becoming a no man's sky type revive
Event[0],Cyberpunk absolutely does not have better writing…
Event[0],no reason to skip one of the greatest games of this generation
Event[0],"How is it overrated, there’s no game that has that level of detail, i can understand not enjoying the slow paced gameplay, but you can’t deny that no game has pushed the boundaries of open world like red dead in terms of immersion."
Event[0],sure buddy go play ludo
Event[0],You're getting hate but it's true. RD2 felt more like an interactive movie than a game.
Event[0],"For reference, I have played both and love both, I even lean towards rdr2, but I am recommending based on OP's interests, unlike most of you"

Event[0],I’ll be honest I thought RDR2 was a tedious piece of trash and nothing like the first game. Cyberpunk   Is more fun and you’ll want to play it more.
Event[0],"Cyberpunk is getting a big expansion in September, along with a huge update that overhauls the whole game pretty much. Definitely hit RDR first and then grab cyberpunk after the update sometime."
Event[0],Great story.  Great gameplay.  Great experience overall.
Event[0],"I think it has some serious flaws but most of those flaws are in line with the vision of the game rather than being oversights. Like all the animations and forced walk sections, or the controls not being very arcadey with no jump button. The main flaw that defies this rule is the absurdly on-the-rails quests, which are typical for Rockstar.

All of that being said, it was in many ways a masterwork. Unparalleled attention to detail. Felt great to explore and discover. Could sink absurd hours into it or just pick up and play, and either way is fun. I find myself coming back to it all the time and finding things I missed.

It was imo the first Open World to feature both breadth and depth in world design without being riddled with bugs. You can tell the crunch went into perfecting the details rather than throwing the game together.

Gameplay and story not revolutionary but consistently solid."
Event[0],It’s an absolute masterpiece.
Event[0],"I've played and beaten both, and I love both games. That being said RDR2 is a fucking masterpiece. I don't know any game I'd pick over rdr2 in a one on one."
Event[0],"It's probably the deepest and most fully realized open world ever crafted, filled with rich and compelling characters, emergent choices, and awesome things to discover. It's held up by many experts as one of the iconic examples of video games as art. But go off, chief. Contrarianism is all the rage."
Event[0],"It would be easier to list what components of RDR2 *do not* have depth:

Enemies - it's all pew pew guys across the board.

Mounts - it's all horses across the board.

As for narrative, gameplay, world building, world interaction, customization, side missions, character developments, npc interactions, etc. etc. etc., I could go on but I've given your clearly catty, insincere comment enough effort and time, maybe just become more interesting in the future and open up with a compelling point next time."
Event[0],September 26.
Event[0],Haha very true that was a Freudian slip!
Event[0],"If you can get it cheap then maybe but I don't think it's worth it, personally."
Event[0],Rdr1 is the only one I can think of
Event[0],GTA
Event[0],Death Stranding I suppose both tedious games but are top 3 for me
Event[0],Oh that’s good to know. And thanks for the correction
Event[0],No they plan to overhaul the ai and make other changes. (Better Skill tree for example)
Event[0],"In which case, the cheapest version. The ultimate edition just has online content iirc"
Event[0],"Is the story really good or are the characters just carrying everything? Playing rn and the story is kind of meh. Rockstar games never really had a great main story, but that is not necessary with all the fun.

Not saying I'm right, just how I am feeling right now."
Event[0],[deleted]
Event[0],"Many actually. And even as a huge fan myself, I understand that the pacing of that story is all over the place and many of my friends drop it after initial 2-3 snowy hours and I keep on trying to convince them."
Event[0],"When I was contemplating rdr2 I felt like you. I also was unsure about the horse riding mechanic, as I was used to GTA and using vehicles. And I was unsure I would enjoy the 1899 setting. But let me tell you, get this game! It’s so good. You will end up being fascinated with the world, including the horse riding."
Event[0],"I've tried to get into RDR2 multiple times, I really appreciate the quality and complexity of the game, but I just can't, because I find the entire cowboy setting to be boring and uninteresting."
Event[0],"The game was so good and complete at release, it didn’t need it."
Event[0],"There's a reason why they made auto aim the default in RDR2, because the combat is so clunky that it needs it"
Event[0],It’s a very boring gameplay that’s for sure.
Event[0],Mainly because the mission design and combat are so bad
Event[0],"I play on PS5, so I wouldn't know much about epic store vs steam. Maybe try asking on the Red Dead sub, they will probably give better answers than I could"
Event[0],You can mod pretty much everygame on steam just as well if not better than epic. Some games even have steam cumunity mods through the steam store such as l4d2. Really the only reason id choose epic over steam for anything is if epic is giving a game away for free and even them there are some cases where id still just rather buy it from steam.
Event[0],Good bot
Event[0],The freind i borrowed it from said the same thing so i guess it varied from person to person. My experience was a mess. Nothing game breaking in the sense that i couldn't progress but a lot of religing becouse i got stuck in terminals and uis. Also had this one where jackie always had his gun out no matter what animtion he was doing or where he was. Even had it on that mission where we coukdnt bring our guns. Nothing could have been done to fix that one just had to accept that that was jakie now for that playthrough
Event[0],"Im with this guy, never had any game breaking bugs in this game from day 1. Playing PC with a good gpu over on my end tho. If youve got a 30 series gpu or newer cyberpunk runs literally fine"
Event[0],Yeah thats one thing i can personally attest to it looks really good. Also it supports dlss 3 fram generation so it runs really smooth a 4000 series card.
Event[0],"This is a stupid fucking reply

Nowhere did they say that. They're allowed to criticise the controls of a game when someone asks for opinions on that game. Opinions from both sides are important when deciding whether to buy something or not."
Event[0],Never said it was.
Event[0],It's widely agreed the controls and combat are super clunky.
Event[0],"Opinions are opinions my dude, both games had amazing writing but I felt more connected to Cyberpunk."
Event[0],Guess the opinions are divided. I didn't like rdr2's writing very much. What was so great about it then?
Event[0],I agree about the level of detail. For sure it's impressive in that aspect. It's just soooo fucking slooow man. I almost didn't finish that game considering how tedious it was. I'm sorry.
Event[0],Ok
Event[0],"Tedious as f... imo. I almost didn't finish it, but the story got me through. Gameplay was the worst!"
Event[0],"Weird, I was raised by fast paced shooters and such and absolutely adored rdr2 despite its slower nature."
Event[0],"Want to cook some food? 10 minute animation per piece cooked. Want to loot something? 10 minute animation of you picking the body up. Want to skin an animal? 45 minute animation. Oh, and btw, you need hundreds of pelts if you want to do side content. It is the most ridiculous shit.

Everyone kept telling me I needed to get to chapter 2 to really get a feel for the game. I made it past chapter 2 and I still hate the game. Only now I'm past my refund window and hate it even more now.

Every mission is you riding with some member of your crew on horseback for 45 minutes while you get gigantic exposition dumps. RDR2 is the game you get when you distill the WORST parts of the GTA franchise down into a cowboy game.

This was the first game that was universally praised, in a genre I love, that I hated to it's core. It has me questioning whether or not i should even bother buying the last of us on PC."
Event[0],Where are details on the huge update? Can’t seem to find any but very interested
Event[0],Still playing cyberpunk on a console like ps5 is like playing in a ghost town. If OP has a decent rig he should definitely hit cyberpunk in September.
Event[0],"Wasn't this supposed to come out this month? I am very excited about the DLC, but I'll believe the release date once I've downloaded it."
Event[0],"Will they completely drop their sad excuse for an armor system, their sad excuse for a weapon system, and their sad excuse for a perk system? Oh wait… that’s like every system in the damn game. Would be silly to ask for that.

Edit: holy shit it looks like they are!"
Event[0],"I thought it was very visually impressive and well acted. Also the soundtrack fucking slaps. I love the soundtrack. It also usually managed to capture the intended vibe very well. But it wasn't very thought-provoking. And some of the side content just completely misses the mark. 

Cyberpunk is a lot less polished and pleasant. But some of the sidequests could have carried entire high-quality indiegames."
Event[0],"Trailing missions, long ass point a to point b travel, goofy ah shooting, extremely linear missions, breaking the games economy with that stage coach robbery mission. Can’t deny the flaws."
Event[0],Did not know a simple question was a clearly catty insincere comment....
Event[0],"Lol what a pathetically insecure reply. RDR2 has absolutely zero depth when it comes to gameplay, mission structure, level design, or npc interactions. It’s all shallow set dressing for a pretty decent story that would’ve worked better as a TV series. As an actual videogame, it’s average at best."
Event[0],"> I've given your clearly catty, insincere comment enough effort and time, maybe just become more interesting in the future and open up with a compelling point next time.

You’re right - how dare he ask a simple question about your favourite game?! The audacity of /u/ihave0idea0 knows no limits! 

Personally I find RDR2 wholly unappealing to me, mostly because what I’ve seen of the combat mechanics seems quite repetitive and more importantly not skill-based.  
But I also don’t like the Elder Scrolls series or Cyberpunk for the same reason, so this thread just isn’t for me."
Event[0],"Yeah, been through that. And online doesn't do it for me"
Event[0],I actually have that. Might give it a try
Event[0],Oh I’ll wait then damn okay thanks.
Event[0],Thank you very much.
Event[0],"It’s definitely more character driven than plot driven. It might take a while for the story to get going, but when it does, it’s really some of the best dramatic writing I’ve ever seen in anything. It’s worth sticking with for sure."
Event[0],"… that’s what a story is, a journey of characters through an arc. The plot of 99% of stories is the same basic shit."
Event[0],"Fair, I can’t seem to get into Witcher 3, despite being a huge fan of the lore and gameplay.

It just… feels so huge and cumbersome"
Event[0],Yeah the story feels very disjointed. You do like 5 completely unrelated main story missions and then eventually come across another mission that advances the story. How’s that a great story? I get that people like those unrelated main missions since they like long games and are willing to tolerate a somewhat disjointed story if it means a longer game. But you can’t tell me that’s a good story. A good story must have a good flow.
Event[0],Rdr2 is easily top 5 of last gen
Event[0],"Yeah it's not even gameplay.
Just high quality movie"
Event[0],Tried that but didn't get any answer. Other modding subreddits had no idea either. I guess I will try asking there again. Thank you very much.
Event[0],"Actually had a coupon on epic store, so wouldn't want it to go to waste. I have some other the list but would live to know if epic store version can be modded. The RDR2 subreddit seems kinda dead with most of the posts with no replies so I think I might not get one there either."
Event[0],Best bot
Event[0],">This is a stupid fucking reply

Exactly my thoughts lol.

I absolutely loved RDR2 but I can totally see how it can be boring for some people. In fact, I've seen plenty of comments on various subs saying exactly that, so I think it's important thing to highlight for OP."
Event[0],"It was cool at first but then I just got tired of it quick. I also work 50hrs a week with like 1 hour commute one way so I just don’t have time for slow games anymore. 
That being said getting off a horse just to pick something up every time is just an awful game play design."
Event[0],What a debby downer you are. Pessimistic much? Lol
Event[0],Valid
Event[0],"[Check it](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/147domj/everything_new_with_phantom_liberty_and_patch_17/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)

I’m pretty excited"
Event[0],It says September 26th on steam. Even if you don't get the DLC you still get access to the massive overhaul btw.
Event[0],I think the side content is amazing. Maybe some things could be better but it is very good
Event[0],"Yeah I get that but thought provoking is not what I expect from Rockstar, or any game outside of select RPGs.

It’s more like a great execution of a tried and true formula. If I wanted a thought provoking Western, I’d reread Blood Meridian, not play an open world game."
Event[0],There’s nothing thought provoking about Cyperpunk either
Event[0],They’re not flaws…  They’re features!
Event[0],Yeah rockstar hasn't improved it's gameplay since GTA San Andreas. It's a shame because visually and story wise the games are brilliant
Event[0],"It's not a simple question, it's probably the most highly praised game of the last decade, pretending that you know nothing about it whatsoever and have decided to randomly come to me to learn more about it is naive and stupid at best."
Event[0],"And this is the kind of dumbass mentality that went behind asking 'hurr, what kind of depth rdr2 got?'"
Event[0],"The OP asked which game should he play, not your emotional personal take that doesn’t help at all and literally NO ONE cares about"
Event[0],I hear you. Just the most similar gameplay I could think of. Basically the same game at a different time period with different technology.
Event[0],"Story wise, propably. Gameplay, definetly not."
Event[0],I dont see why not you wouldnt be able too. Modding alters your local files on your system so i feel like whichever store front you bought it from wouldnt matter. All the games ive ever modded were on steam but i never had to actually interact with steam to do it so i feel like the same processes would have worked even if i bought them from epic.
Event[0],"Fair enough, that horse thing is true"
Event[0],"Everyone I know loves this game. So I never criticize it around them, because I would feel like a debbie downer. It was just exciting to finally see someone else hate it."
Event[0],Everything he said is valid and he’s entitled to his opinion. That isn’t pessimism
Event[0],"The shredder of panda guy I’m replying to blocked  me, then reported me to Reddit for some kinda wellness check?? People are so weird.. wtf"
Event[0],"Thank you. 

Man I am hype now."
Event[0],I'm happy for you. That I didn't feel the same doesn't mean I want to take that away from you
Event[0],"I don't think thought provoking was something they were not trying to do. The story of the main characters in what is essentially a cult was compelling but just not for that long. 

Also looking at cyberpunk again. I think there are plenty of moments there that could be labeled thought provoking. 

Maybe I just wanted the wrong things from the game."
Event[0],"No? What about Joshua's quest line? Rivers quest line? The quests with the mayor and his wife? V's story, the different endings. Even the quest with the vending machine ends up asking some interesting questions."
Event[0],Let’s hope for gta 6 I personally didn’t like rdr2 as much as other people did for personal reasons but I still thought it was a fantastic game
Event[0],"Damn, you even double-downed on it.

People ARE allowed to not know everything about RDR2, man.

You clearly spend a lot of time thinking about your favourite video games - that’s fine, but you should realise that other people may have other interests and may actually not know much about it, if at all.

As I said I personally find the gameplay uninteresting (not sure how you can think it has a lot of depth, tbh) - and a game without good gameplay is just a bad game to me. Therefore I have little interest in Rockstar games in general, because their gameplay is usually super casual-oriented.

As for the rest of you description of the depth of the game, you used a bunch of buzz-words but didn’t actually explaining anything to the guy.

Good graphics, good story, world building, character development and voice acting are great, but if that’s all there is to it, I’d rather watch a movie or read a book tbh. Gameplay is where games are at for me, and a lot of people in general."
Event[0],"Did you mean to reply to someone else?

How am I the emotional one for replying to someone having a complete meltdown at the mère idea that someone didn’t know the alleged qualities of RDR2?

I explained why I thought that neither games thought of by OP were particularly good in my opinion. That’s very relevant to the discussion.

What’s the point of your needlessly aggressive comment that no one asked for and no one cares about, to use your own words?"
Event[0],Exactly. However I think my emotional investment was larger in rdr2. But time period doesn't really matter.
Event[0],"Thanks for the reply. Just wanted to make sure. Actually, I heard and experienced issues with modding, especially with Bethesda games in Epic Games Store. And in general have heard people saying that Epic store is pretty bad if someone wants to play with mods. Modding for me is one of the main and most fun things (especially in games like Skyrim) so sometimes no excess to mods can be a huge deal breaker for me."
Event[0],"""10 minute animation. 45 minute animation"". Yeah sure  that's real valid isn't it lol. Someone being overly negative and blowing something out of proportion is considered to be pessimistic to me. I never said he was wrong and couldn't have an opinion. I just called him a debby downer. I'm entitled to my opinion as well right?"
Event[0],"Hey, what didn’t you like about the side content? I guess hunting is kinda barebones"
Event[0],"Rivers quest was so boring. Go here, fetch this. Fetch that. Search the nephews room for clues. Snooze fest. It was nothing I haven’t seen before a million times. Most of the side quests were boring as hell. There were some cool moments, but thought provoking? Nah."
Event[0],"Don't care, didn't read; get more interesting and stop leaning on sarcasm as a crutch for your lack of personality."
Event[0],Continue with your non contributions. Op asked which game and here you are just wasting thread space
Event[0],If you want to rant about how terrible RDR2 is make your own post
Event[0],"Your making comments on someone’s character over a game, if anything you’re a Debby downer"
Event[0],"Some of the sidequests were kinda stupid and unsatisfying. The one that stuck in my mind the most was the one where you encounter that woman who takes advantage of two guys with disabilities and the ark of the story is that the guys don't want to be with her because she's an absolutely horrible, abusive human being. Then when you find them they realise that they're still gonna go with her. 

Like what's the point? I had no input, the ark of the characters was to learn to put up with an abuser and it took like 20 minutes. 

&#x200B;

Not to say that I encountered no good sidequests. The one where you help a woman learn to live in the forest was lovely. But the game to me was littered with moments that ended in an unsatisfying anticlimax."
Event[0],"Very interesting. What did you think of >!
Jackies funeral? !<"
Event[0],"That comes from the guy that screeched and had a complete meltdown when someone else dared ask which kind of depth RDR2 had, because how dare he not know your favourite video game.

There is 0 irony in my last comment, btw! Not that I would expect you to understand irony…

Lmfao, reddit basement-dweller moment."
Event[0],"What’s YOUR contribution, lad? What’s your purpose? Why are you commenting?

As I said above, I explained why I thought neither of the games were particularly good in my opinion. That’s highly relèvent on a sub where people ask whether they should buy specific games.

My comment is on topic. Yours aren’t and are just useless attacks with 0 contribution on the actual subject. Are you perhaps an alt of the other guy? That’s the o my way this would make sense, tbh. You’re weird"
Event[0],"Ranting? For a whole 2 lines? Do you even know what a rant is? Open a dictionary ffs

The guy above had a meltdown when someone asked a simple question, I pointed out to him that no everyone necessarily liked every game or knew everything about every game.

That’s highly relevant to the conversation.

Once again, what is YOUR contribution here, apart from attacking me for no reason?"
Event[0],You're making comments about my character over a reddit post. A bit hypocritical.
Event[0],"Well, I didn't realize they had disabilities. Maybe I'm just stupid. I'm guessing your talking about the one where you had to keep punching and kicking those guys to prove which one was stronger? 

I saw it as funny, and I never saw them go back to her, I don't think I ever saw them after their final mission.  


Maybe I just didn't find them or I'm stupid. Oh well, I enjoyed those missions, and yeah that one with charlotte (woman in forest) was great."
Event[0],Getting his bike was the best part
Event[0],"No, you were in fact, weird because no one cares what you don’t like. I was genuinely interested in seeing how much people loved one game over the other but here you are."
Event[0],I already gave my contribution
Event[0],"My contribution was that I love both games but I feel like RDR two gets the one here because not only is it one of the greatest games of all time, but the story is pretty impactful"
Event[0],My context might seem illiterate because I am using voice to text
Event[0],"I think we're talking about another quest.  I googled it, it's called ""the smell of grease paint""."
Event[0],"Intruiging. I absolutely love that quest for how real it feels. 
>! How it takes the time to mourn and speak to the people that this affected. Presenting a death so realistically gave so much validity to the rest of the world. It made me remember times I've lost people. 
Death in video games is never presented like this. !<"
Event[0],"That sounds like a you issue, tbh

- Some people love one game more than the other

- some people prefer the other one

- some people like neither of them

These are all valid opinions on the exact same subject. I’m in the third camp, for reasons that I explained. I would therefore recommend OP to buy neither of these games if the reasons I gave resonate with him.

It’s hilarious that you don’t see that my comment is very much on topic for this thread - logic isn’t your forte, huh"
Event[0],"Clearly not in this chain of comment, which is why I’m asking you what you’re even doing here."
Event[0],"Fair enough! That’s understandable.

My contribution was that I didn’t like either of them for the reason stated above (gameplay isn’t interesting or skill-based enough, and that’s what matters most in games in my opinion), and therefore wouldn’t recommend either of them.

Don’t you see how my opinion is just as valid as yours? Again, why are you commenting here?"
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"There's not a sequel, but there is dlc. Idk about it being a cool down game, I get pretty tilted playing it. Lots of playtime possibility. I would wait for a sale, though, and see if you can pick up afterbirth too"
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"The game is great, probably the best of it's genre, but absolutely not a chill game"
The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,Thanks
Unpacking,RDR2 is an absolute triumph. It MUST be played.
Unpacking,"I would generally recommend RDR2, which is one of the best games ever made.

Presentation is absolutely stunning across the board. Graphics, SFX, music, voice acting, all are absolutely stellar.

Gameplay-wise is also phenomenal. Essentially, to summarise, it plays as a 3rd-person shooter, with some RPG and simulation elements - it really shines in making you *feel* like the character you're playing as, that is, a cowboy in the late 19th/early 20th century, with all the gambling, outlawing, hunting, etc.

The content available is frankly some of the best value in any videogame. This is the most well-realised open-world game ever, in my estimation - an immersive world that feels natural and alive, that exists independently of you but reacts to your decisions. The story is fully fleshed out, dramatic, personal and intimate, but also self-aware enough to shine all the wild west tropes through. You have further an entire online mode that I haven't even touched yet.

When considering the preferences you laid out, I'm even more convinced you'll enjoy it. I'd recommend it over cyberpunk to anyone, but even more to someone with your preferences."
Unpacking,"RDR2 is probably the better made game but I also loved Cyberpunk, it’s story, and it felt very creative and new. I liked someone else’s idea of doing RDR2 and buy Cyberpunk when DLC comes out so you can transition straight to DLC"
Unpacking,"Love both, but I’d start with RDR2 buddy. And just know, it’ll be awhile before you start Cyberpunk once you get immersed into that work and Aruthur"
Unpacking,U can miss cyberpunk. U cant pass on RDR2! Easy as that
Unpacking,"Rdr2 without a doubt. The most beautiful open world, lots of chill out time, lots of random and very well written scripted quests, a sense of history with a bit of the absurd, and a tragic crime family story. It will give you a thrill, make you feel like a badass, and then leave you in tears."
Unpacking,"I’m sure there will be a Complete Edition for Cyberpunk/Phantom Liberty, so wait on that. Cyberpunk was great; loved the story, Night City and the RPG elements. Granted I played on PS5 when that version was released. 

Red Dead Redemption II is one of the greatest games ever made. Five years later and it’s still worth full price. The quantity and quality of content is impressive."
Unpacking,RDR2
Unpacking,"As someone that was super hyped cyberpunk and hit it day 1, as faulty and buggy as it was at the time on my ps4, I enjoyed it, and now 100 times better with the next gen update and all on my ps5, that being said, RDR2 was one of the best games of the last generation, and it plays great on next gen consoles… definitely recommend RDR2, it’s not an rpg but getting lost in that world and along with the things you discover in it are very rpg like to me, definitely recommend RDR2"
Unpacking,"RDR2.

Cyberpunk is cool, but it will be much cooler in a few months with the update/remake

I also would only get cyberpunk if you have at least a PS5/next gen/pc"
Unpacking,Red dead redemption until cyberpunk dlc is released
Unpacking,"No question, RDR2 all the way!"
Unpacking,"I feel like RDR2 is a much better overall game, but is more divisive than you would be lead to believe. It's a slow burn story game, so if you're cool with that, it's way better.

Cyberpunk is exactly as you expect it to look and feel."
Unpacking,"Cyberpunk base game is also been a lot of improvements when the DLC releases so get cyberpunk then with the DLC, for now its time for RDR2 Boah!!"
Unpacking,RDR2
Unpacking,RDR2 without a doubt
Unpacking,"Red dead, even though I mostly play rpgs. Even though it’s fairly polished now I just find Cyberpunk to be boring. Idk I hope someday I can engage with it but it’s not now."
Unpacking,"RDR2

Cyberpunk is also a very good game, and I do recommend you play it eventually

But with the DLC just around the corner (only three months away in fact) you should wait until it releases before getting it"
Unpacking,"Wait for the DLC and play RDR2 while you wait. I personally liked Cyberpunk more, but RDR2 is amazing aswell."
Unpacking,"Rdr2 and I liked both of them, but RDR2 is on another level"
Unpacking,Rdr2
Unpacking,"RDR2 is the most polished game I have ever played. The environments are highly-interactive and the world with it’s animals and people respond to you and each other in a very believable way. It’s story is an engaging epic action-drama grounded in reality. It’s extremely immersive.

CP2077 had very rough beginnings and, when I last played it late last year, that roughness still shows through on what otherwise feels like quite a nice game. Everyone knows about the bugs, so there’s no point mentioning them more here.  The physical environments and sound design are very well set up. But the NPCs populating the world will behave in ways that might break your immersion. When a gun is fired, they will all crouch in the same animation and despawn as soon as you aren’t looking. Police will spawn in on top of you when you commit a crime and don’t put up any chase when you flee. Feels disappointing in a world constructed around the notion of constant police-gang struggle. Supposedly this is slated to be reworked in the future.
The world has some interactivity more on par with games like dishonored 2. Dialogue feels particularly strong and the story is, in my experience, engaging. 
One strange thing is the character customisation. One premise of the world building is ‘fashion over function’. How you look is supposedly as important as how you act on the world of 2077. But this is totally at odds with the actual game mechanics. You will be heavily encouraged to wear clothes for their stats, not their appearance, and that will lead to some pretty weird costume combos. It doesn’t matter much because the game is entirely first person perspective, but that begs the (controversial?) question of why have a player model at all."
Unpacking,Yes red dead redemption is much better on many levels right off the bat.
Unpacking,Rdr2
Unpacking,"Rdr2 100%. In my opinion it’s the best/most realistic video game ever made. The only downside is it’s ruined every game I’ve played after it. Either the graphics look terrible, the story is dumb, gaming mechanics aren’t as good etc.."
Unpacking,"Hands down, RDR2. While I enjoyed Cyberpunk for what it is, I don't think that's a close call by almost any metric."
Unpacking,"Red Dead Redemption 2 by far; I 100% Cyberpunk 2077, I did not 100% Red Dead.  Cyberpunk doesn't not have a lot of depth, unfortunately, its presentation is good and certainly has gotten better since launch but literally the only time I would even talk about it in the same breath as RDR2 is a question like yours, in terms of quality and depth and content, it doesn't hold a candle to RDR2.

There is of course a difference in setting to consider, but just keep in mind that while the 'cyberpunk' aesthetic is certainly present in Cyberpunk 2077, I'd argue it doesn't even do it as well as games like Shadowrun for SNES or Shadowrun for Genesis.  That may seem harsh, but again I did everything you could do in this game, it really doesn't have much going for it."
Unpacking,RDR2
Unpacking,"I would wait for the the dlc for Cyberpunk as it seems it will be some kind of mega side quest and will bring improvements to the base game as well, rdr2 is hit or miss I guess depending on people, it's a slow paced game but amazing visuals, story and immersion but with that said I finished cyberpunk and still will come back for the dlc, the game has a pretty big replayability if you like trying different approach to combat"
Unpacking,"If you don't mind a slow burn for massive payoff then go for RDR2. You'll want to wait to play CP2077 until Phantom Liberty releases as they're doing an overhaul of the base game too.

Edit: Liberty not Pain"
Unpacking,RDR2
Unpacking,"No, it's not Next-Gen Optimized, but still RDR2 all day every day"
Unpacking,"RDR2 is the superior game in my opinion. Cyberpunk is pretty bland in comparison. However, Cyberpunk has better performance in that, it can run at 60 fps on next- gen consoles (whereas RDR2 is locked at 30 fps) and is better optimized on PC, though still expect bugs. Also, RDR2 can be overwhelming with its size and detail, Cyberpunk is much smaller in scale."
Unpacking,RDR 2 if you like a beautiful masterpiece
Unpacking,"I just started RD2 on PC about a week ago and it’s absolutely sensational.

I do plan on getting CP after the new DLC comes out tho, and after I finish the main story in RD2!"
Unpacking,You like computers or cowboys?
Unpacking,"Seems like they’re going to add lots of fixes to the new gen consoles version of cyberpunk along with the expansion, so I think you should play RDR2 until a much better version of cyberpunk is out."
Unpacking,RDR2.
Unpacking,Red Dead Redemption 2
Unpacking,"Wait for the Dlc of Cyberpunk, the game will get a massive overhaul with it"

Unpacking,RDR2 duh. CP2077 world and setting is unlike anything I've seen before so that's why I liked it but the story and gameplay was just ok to me.
Unpacking,"RD2 

Wait for cyberpunks expansion and then get it. It’s a good game on its own. Think Skyrim but in a cyberpunk setting. Yes is failed on some major systems they were supposed to have. Supposedly they are reworking a ton which will drop with the new expansion in September"
Unpacking,Red Dead. Definitely Red Dead.
Unpacking,RDR 2 hands down!
Unpacking,rdr2 for sure!
Unpacking,Rdr2
Unpacking,"I might get some hate, but i enjoyed cyberpunk way more than i did rdr2. Maybe rdr2 was too tedious for me, or i didnt like the setting so much. Not sure, still a masterpiece though. 
Still id get cp2077"
Unpacking,Red Dead Redemption 2
Unpacking,RDR2. By a mile!
Unpacking,"There has recently (as in, this weekend) been an article about the Cyberpunk DLC. Along side it is an overall of almost every system. The state its in now, Cyberpunk is *fine.* The open world feels so dead and empty, with nothing ever changing. You can stand and watch a NPC for 5 hours, and they will not move from there spot. The gunplay is fantastic, and the story is good, although that's of course subjective) I think part of that will be changing, along with the many other little tweaks they will be making, along side adding the DLC. So I would hold off. 

&#x200B;

RDR2, in contrast is amazing. The story, combat, graphics are wonderful and I don't have much bad to say about the game. My only complaint is the pacing of the story. It drags on a little to much, but at the same time, that's kind of the point? So It seems a weird complaint. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, TL;DR- Buy RDR2, Hold of on Cyberpunk until the DLC is released"
Unpacking,Red dead 2. That game is forever in my heart
Unpacking,"If you like RPG games, go for cyberpunk. But if you want an experience go for RDR2. Many people say that rdr2 doesn’t have a good story, but I believe that it is amazing. But I think everyone will agree that rdr2 has the best protagonist of all time, Arthur Morgan."
Unpacking,[deleted]
Unpacking,"It took me almost 70h to complete the main story in RDR2 that is without any side missions or free roaming.

Done the cyberpunk main story a lot of side quests and done some free roaming all under 50h"
Unpacking,Both are great but I'd wait for Cyberpunk fixes and qol that come with the expansion so RDR2 first
Unpacking,"RDR2 is probably the better made game but I also loved Cyberpunk, it’s story, and it felt very creative and new. I liked someone else’s idea of doing RDR2 and buy Cyberpunk when DLC comes out so you can transition straight to DLC"
Unpacking,"I completed cyberpunk 3x with lowered graphics and shit fps. (Roll on phantom liberty with a 3080)

I didnt finish RDR2s first? Second? Act.

Dont get me wrong, I think RDR2 is an amazing game, probably the better one, but these are the facts lol."
Unpacking,Rdr2.  Then In September you can get CP when it gets somewhat overhauled by developers
Unpacking,Why is that even a question? RDR2 should be the default answer to this.
Unpacking,Get both honestly. They are both masterpieces of games. I personally enjoy Cyberpunk a lot more but they are both fantastic in terms of story and gameplay.
Unpacking,Cp 2077
Unpacking,"I'd go with RDR2 first and, depending on how much free time you have, by the time you're done with it there'll probably be some version of Cyberpunk with Phantom Liberty included. Either way you'll have a great time with both, enjoy!"
Unpacking,"I admit that rdr2 is the better made game,  I just got bored by it.  Cyberpunk was way more fun and engaging to me. I played on a pretty good pc, and didn't really have any expectations going into the game,  so I wasn't soured by anything.

Rockstar games kinda just bore me tbh. After playing the ps2 gta games to death,  any Rockstar game after just feels like it plays the exact same."
Unpacking,I love Cyberpunk and never had bug issues. You should 100% get red dead as it’s probably the best game ever created.
Unpacking,Red Dead Redemption 2 is already a complete game. Cyberpunk still needs polishing and should be even more solid after the expansion comes out in September. RDR2 will hold you until then.
Unpacking,"if u have a series console, ps5, or high end pc, get cyberpunk for 30$ plus the expansion for another 30$. if u don't have that, then id say RDR2"
Unpacking,"Have both and played both.  
RDR2 is super immersive and so finely tuned - but it is an open world Rockstar game so it's going to be a bit overwhelming, at least it was to me.  
Cyberpunk is also open world but a bit more linear.  It has that Skyrim like maneuverability where things can get wonky but it allows the player more freedom. 

I'd say go for cyberpunk and just play it now so you have an understanding of the game and story before the dlc comes out."
Unpacking,"I have both.

Cyberpunk is more of RPG style than RDR2. There's skill points and such to distribute. RDR2 increases stats for you based on what you do.

Cyberpunk's AI have health bars, red dead's doesn't. It's more immersive for that reason.

RDR2 is much slower pace, but has a lot more to explore. The scenery can be breath-taking and sometimes hard to fathom how good it looks. 

Cyberpunk has a lot of nothing, but it still looks pretty cool. Nice graphics.

So far, I like cyberpunk's story but it can seem a bit all over the place.

RDR2 has been easier to follow."
Unpacking,"If you just want a decent story with an immersive world and nice graphics, RDR2 is fine for that. It has pretty terrible gameplay, and it's a brain-dead easy game that treats players like they have 60 IQ. If you just want to turn off your brain for 60-hours and play through a decent story, then it fits the bill. Especially if you like the wild west and spaghetti western movies, then you will probably like RDR2. 

Cyberpunk has way better art direction than RDR2, but the game is severely lacking in terms of a lot of its open world systems. It has nowhere near as immersive of an open world as RDR2. The setting and visuals are a lot cooler, but the actual execution isn't there. The combat is not very good, but it's at least better than RDR2 in this area. It also has RPG systems and build variety which RDR2 doesn't have. Overall I'd say just wait until the DLC drops, because apparently they have reworked a lot of aspects of the game. CP2077 really does have a lot of potential, so if the DLC lives up to the hype, then it could be a game changer."
Unpacking,I just tried cyberpunk a couple weeks ago off a freinds familyshare and its still super buggy to the point where i wound up getting fed up with the bugs and uninstalling. I would have felt very cheated if it was a game i payed for. So i would go with RDR2
Unpacking,"Everyone says RDR2 is the best game ever, but the janky controls are super frustrating and honestly it’s pretty slow at times. I don’t need to watch long animations every time I pick something up or do anything. It’s more cowboy sim than game. 

Tried it 3 times and never make it past 10 hrs or so."
Unpacking,[deleted]
Unpacking,Both
Unpacking,Mount a blade bannerlord has great rpg mechanics you can literally be anything in that world
Unpacking,I would only choose Cyberpunk solely because it has next gen support. RDR2 is a fantastic game but lacks that kind of support which makes me personally not touch it ever since I beat it back in 2018.
Unpacking,"RDR2. It’s a much more immersive game and story. Cyberpunk is a great game too, but I don’t find the story as good at all. The pros about cyberpunk are extreme weapon customization and playstyle customization with perk trees. When I play RDR2 I feel like I’m in the story, and when I play Cyberpunk I feel like I’m in a gigantic beautiful sandbox game."
Unpacking,Cyberpunk
Unpacking,"RDR2 is much more story rich and interactive compared to cyberpunk. It only takes around 30 hours to complete the main mission, spoiler alert ( when doing the last mission after doing so you get back to prior of starting the last mission to finish anything else to basically you don't fully finish it). It has nice features, ray tracing, and a nice environment, but RDR2 beats it in every other way. That's from my opinion as i have both and played both for 100 hours plus on each."
Unpacking,"Cyberpunk has better writing and combat. Rdr2's world is more detailed, alive and polished. 
I prefer cyberpunk.
Most people seem to prefer rdr2."
Unpacking,"RDR2. Ive played both and Cyberpunk really lacks in a lot of areas and i didn’t get much enjoyment from it after completing the main story line. RDR2 however is a game that ive replayed numerous times and spent upwards of 400 hours combined playing, most of it in free roam. Havent even touched the online yet."
Unpacking,"Cyberpunk's DLC will remain as a DLC, it seems to be set in a new city, but at this point, nothing can be done about the game's dullness and how unfun it is to play. I played it for 25 hours(right until the 3-race side mission were unlocked), and it's just boring, the plot is mediocre, the fighting, the gameplay are subpar, the only redeeming thing was how beautiful everything looked, and that's it"
Unpacking,I would be cautious with RDR2 on PC. I had to get a refund on it due to the game constantly crashing; the issues had to do specifically with the Rockstar games launcher which you are required to use.
Unpacking,"Rdr2 is a bit of an ancient game in terms of design. Missions force you to do things one way and if you don’t listen the game fails you. It’s also an aggressively easy game that just feels stiff and clunky mechanics wise. It’s got great voice acting, but I found the world and story pretty dull. Cyberpunk is a far more enjoyable game that gives you choices on how to handle each mission with much better combat and a much more interesting world to explore and a far more interesting story."
Unpacking,"This is a hard one, gotta do both haha"
Unpacking,neither buy rain world 😈😈
Unpacking,RDR2 no contest
Unpacking,"Depends, if you're on console I would skip RDR2, it still runs at 30FPS, rockstar doesn't care about next gen update."
Unpacking,"Neither, buy doom eternal"
Unpacking,I dont like rdr2 at all and like project red games
Unpacking,Cyberpunk. Red dead 2 is overrated imo
Unpacking,They’re both great go with what interests you more.
Unpacking,I've played both and I have some stronger critiques on RD2 than most but would still pick it over CP.
Unpacking,"Both games are amazing, i loved Cyberpunk it's story characters, scenery. currently playing RDR2 its really good, both games are great. I'd buy both if i were u"
Unpacking,Robots and guns or cowboys and guns
Unpacking,"I’d go for Cyberpunk personally. The game is really good as long as you take your time and do the side quests. There are a ton of really compelling stories that get told. I’d wait to play until Phantom Liberty releases though. The gameplay is already good, but it’s rumored they’re going to be shipping big improvements to key systems like the AI and the police systems (and possibly more) with the DLC."
Unpacking,I recommend getting both
Unpacking,"Both are incredible story games, depends on what you want. If you care about story and characters, go red dead, if you care about combat and replay ability go cyberpunk"
Unpacking,"Rdr2, 100000%"
Unpacking,Cyberpunk if you want action. Red dead if you don't mind watching a movie in game format.
Unpacking,Rdr2 cyberpunk has a lot of problems
Unpacking,RDR2
Unpacking,Red dead partner!
Unpacking,Red Dead is the better game hands down.
Unpacking,RDR2
Unpacking,Do you want to be a cowboy? If so…follow your heart
Unpacking,Cyberpunk has a big DLC coming soon.
Unpacking,"With the Phantom Liberty expansion, which overhaul all of cyberpunk. It will great to buy...


But RDR2 is a moderm masterpiece so it gets my vote"
Unpacking,"Cyberpunk is more action and adrenaline, Red Dead Redemption 2 is more laid back and slow-paced.  


Cyberpunk has been getting updates continually since release and is awesomely upgraded by this point...I never finished RDR2, but I finished Cyberpunk and am waiting at the edge of my seat for Phantom Liberty, which is going to be a *huge* DLC and should be later this year.  


Cyberpunk.  My two cents."
Unpacking,"RDR2, it's much more detailed and alive rather than cyberprank, tho I enjoyed cyberprank (played from friend's console) its just not within the same level of RDR2 also the balancing of story telling and action on RDR2 is peak unlike in cyberpunk you're always just sitting and listening"
Unpacking,I don’t usually post on reddit but i just want to make sure that you get RDR2
Unpacking,"Both are great, but I think Cyberpunk is the more engaging game. Red Dead suffers from the antiquated Rockstar game design. Almost no freedom during missions, you’re just railroaded through each section and must play it as the developers intend."
Unpacking,Red dead 2 is my pick. Cyberpunk was fun but i can’t just sit back and enjoy the world like i can with RDr2
Unpacking,"In my opinion, Red Dead Redemption 2 was an incredible experience, especially in the beginning and middle game. However, I found myself getting bored after reaching around 60% completion, as there weren't many new things to explore once I had acquired the best weapon. 

On the other hand, Cyberpunk had superior writing and enjoyable gameplay, but it did suffer from some noticeable bugs."
Unpacking,"RDR2 and anyone who says diff is crazy ive completed both games and theres just nothing that compares to RDR2 everything about it is so amazing but for me my fav thing about the game was the story telling. the best storytelling ive ever experienced in a game hands down. it could of been a oscar winning film. i literally cryed during a few scenarios in the game,"
Unpacking,Lol EASY choice. RDR2.
Unpacking,Are you on pc ? If you don’t wanna keep the games forever. I can tell you how to get them for like 2$ both on steam
Unpacking,"I vote rdr, as well. BUT, if you haven't played Witcher 3, that's another great one. Plus, it often heavily discounted."
Unpacking,RDR2 and its not even close
Unpacking,"Red dead 2. There isn’t a game that has immersed me more than this game, I play butt nekkid and pretend I’m a O’Driscol. 10 Cowboys out of 10"
Unpacking,"I’ve played both and loved both, but I fully believe that RDR2 is truly the best game ever, go with that first!"
Unpacking,"Rdr2 is very pretty and has some interesting things in it but from a gameplay perspective it's unbelievably barren. You don't even get to aim your gun in this game really and all the missions are basically ""walk here, listen to dialogue, kill guys"".

Cyberpunk at least has some depth to combat. It's a passable first person shooter. Not a great one mind you, but it works. The missions here are also just ""walk here, listen to dialogue, kill guys"".

Personally the dialogue in both these games puts me to sleep and that's like 70% of both. But I guess I would say the Rdr2 dialogue at least feels finished, whereas the cyberpunk dialogue very frequently feels like a placeholder."
Unpacking,RDR 2 is a no brainer in this case
Unpacking,"Cyberpunk over RDR2. While RDR2 is a great game, i found it slow, and alot of the “immersive” mechanics being pretty surface level and just boring. Unpopular take, but Cyberpunk is more fun."
Unpacking,I’d wait till the new expansion for CP2077 comes out. It’s supposed to bring a whole bunch of QOL changes to the base game.
Unpacking,RDR2
Unpacking,No
Unpacking,"RDR2 was fun, but I was more hyped for Cyberpunk 2077. Ended up not caring for RDR2 so much after burning myself out on it, but Cyberpunk absolutely failed me in almost every department. RDR2 is the way to go."
Unpacking,"Wait for the cyberpunk dlc to drop before you buy since they are redoing A LOT of the mechanics. I believe it’s September 26 so you have a lot of time to finish red dead. Plus the summer sale is soonish I think so you might be able to get the game and dlc for cheap depending on what price they set. 

I’ve played both and even though it’s been a while since I played cyberpunk and I just finished red dead 3 days ago both are excellent games in their own right but I’d probably play red dead before cyberpunk."
Unpacking,**\*\*\* me scrolling through the comments to find the crazy psychopath that chooses cyberpunk over rdr2 \*\*\***
Unpacking,Cyberpunk is fun but it doesn’t come close to RDR2.
Unpacking,"It depends on what type of games you like, red dead is more story based and polished, but cyberpunk is more ""fuck around and break the game"", but in a good way

Cyberpunk has leveling and a skill tree, and rdr doesn't, so I think you'd like it more

Also red dead was built with miracles or something because it runs like a dream"
Unpacking,[removed]
Unpacking,Both games are really good but RDR2 is my favourite game all time so pick RDR2
Unpacking,"Both are great, but RDR2 is looong but with lots of content"
Unpacking,Rdr2
Unpacking,Cyberpunk is more fun. RDR2 gets crazy tedious
Unpacking,"Red Dead 2 is worth its weight in gold. The story is perfectly told, with some of the best voice acting I've ever heard in a video game. The world is vast, and you never feel like you're completely out of things to do. Bored of missions? Hunt some animals for upgrades to both your player or your camp. Tired of hunting? Put your criminal mind to robbing a store or train. Want to help the law? Check the local sheriff's office for a bounty. The list of activities goes on and on...


So to answer your question, take a break from the cybernetics and neon signs of Night City and go on a breathtaking journey through late 1800's America with Dutch Van der Linde and the gang!"
Unpacking,"Go with red dead and play cyberpunk after the last dlc comes out. There will probably some sale for a definitive edition down the line.

Both games are definitely worth to be played."
Unpacking,Do you prefer cowboys or cyborgs
Unpacking,Finished Rdr2 3 times already and would pay 200$to forget everything and start the game again without remembering anything. Cyberpunk I enjoyed the story but the game was full of bugs and lost the interest of playing it again even if it is fixed or not
Unpacking,"I played red dead 2 after it had been out for like 4 years not expecting much. I didn't even buy it, I played my brothers copy, that's the only reason I tried it. It turned out to be my favorite game ever. I'm not particularly interested in the wild west. It felt like watching a movie in the best way possible. It's the only game I can think of where I was sad because I knew it was ending soon. I can't recommend it enough.

I was excited for cyberpunk for years. I was incredibly disappointed when I finally was able to play it, I put about 20 hours in it and feel no urge to continue playing it. Even after they've patched it."
Unpacking,"All you need to do is listen to the song ""Video games"" by Tenacious D. You're welcome."
Unpacking,RDR2. Cyberpunk's getting totally reworked head to toe alongside new DLC in September and *that's* when you should buy it.
Unpacking,RDR2
Unpacking,rdr2
Unpacking,RDR2!
Unpacking,Hmph. Rdr2 is a masterpiece. Cyberpunk quite literally is bad. Phantom liberty sounds very promising on paper but we’ll have to see. So did this game pre release and I’d give it a 5/10.
Unpacking,Is this post by OP a joke?
Unpacking,RDR2
Unpacking,"Rdr2 has a much stronger plot and cast. And the world is gorgeous.

Cyberpunk is also fantastic and a lot of fun, BUT it’s a lot more you having to role play the character"
Unpacking,"Loved both, but like everyone has already said, start with RDR2. CP2077 is a fantastic game, but it will get better once the Phantom Liberty update comes out."
Unpacking,Rdr2 all day. By far my fav game all time.. online sux d tho.
Unpacking,I couldn't get into RDR2 personally. I was enjoying the story and it's the most beautiful game ever made but I thought the gameplay and controls were so rudimentary I stopped at Chapter 3. Meanwhile I really liked Cyberpunk especially the story and although its gameplay isn't groundbreaking it didn't stop me from finishing the game.
Unpacking,"Red dead, no doubt."
Unpacking,RDR2 is one of the best games humanity has ever witnessed
Unpacking,"Most people are saying RD2, but my vote is for Cyberpunk. Bugs aren't as bad now, and the story is great. Along with a bunch of different builds. You can be a ninja with a katana, a run and gun madman, or a tech savvy hacker. The atmosphere is great and helps tie everything together, and the characters you meet really make it amazing. Just like all of CDPR's games, they really go all out with side quests and side story characters. Plus, Phantom Liberty releases in September, so if it's on sale, I would go for it. Cyberpunk is by far one of my favorites, and honestly, RD2 doesn't even get close to my top games.
That being said, both Cyberpunk and RD2 are both amazing games. I just lean more towards Cyberpunk."
Unpacking,"I say pick up Cyberpunk, it might be worthwhile to play the game now, with the original story, before playing Phantom Liberty. As Phantom Liberty is very likely going to come with some new endings, and possibly some other changes outside the ones we already know.

Plus I just think its a good game, well worth the money nowadays after 1.5. Mods make it even more fun to play around with. Just an entertaining experience.

On top of that Cyberpunk is truly an RPG, it lets you choose your skills, pick different perks, use different weapons. You truly build your character the way you want. Its very similar to thinks likeSkyrim in that way. Where as Red Dead 2 is just the same character no matter what, there is no leveling system or anything. Its really more of an action adventure title than a true RPG. 

So if you want to get immersed into an RPG and its setting, in similar fashion to things like Skyrim, I recommend 2077."
Unpacking,RDR2 with no hesitation and do not read spoilers.
Unpacking,"Hey unpopular opinion time. I played both.

RDR2 is certainly a marvel. The story is amazing, graphics are second to none, the protagonist is probably the most well flushed out I've ever experienced in a game, and overall the game really is a must play.

....but it's a bit of a drag yeah? It's very slow paced, and I found myself just wanting to play other games from time to time. This isn't really a negative point, and is definitely subjective, but man it can DRAG. 



Cyberpunk (post patches) is a wild ride. The story is a blast, and really kicks. The set pieces are way above what I expected in an open world game. The side quests, as expected from CDPR are just as good, if not better than the main story in many cases. Definitely a case of art direction trumping graphical fidelity. While it doesn't look bad by any stretch... Walking though Chinatown in the middle of the night is a sight to behold. Vibrant neon lighting, crowded streets, some guy getting mugged in an alley, the constant cacophony of people shouting and talking... I haven't felt that level of immersion in a game... Maybe ever.

Yeah it's a bit of a mess. But way better than the sum of its parts. Unfortunately I listened to the online griping, and missed out for longer than necessary, but take from someone who was hesitant, it blew me away.

At the end of the day Cyberpunk is just ***fun***. The shooting is chunky and effective, the driving is arcady but feels good, the plot and characters are fucking bonkers, and there really are just so many ways to play the game.

I played it the first time as a learning curve. A little hacking, a little shotgun, a little melee. It was pure chaos and really felt like I was a newbie in night city trying to climb to the top.

Second time thru and I'm playing full stealth. Feels like a totally different game. I walk in an alley, activate my speed implant, turn invisible, and walk through putting a bullet in everyone's head. Come out the other side, and watch the bodies drop before the cameras ever had a chance to catch me. Suddenly I felt like an elite level assassin that was born and bred in this world.


You can't go wrong either way, but I tip towards CP"
Unpacking,"cyberpunk, rdr2 is a linear game in an open world setting with the most boring chapter 1 in existence, also everything you do (pointless animation) is so slow and infuriating that you can fall asleep"
Unpacking,I think rdr2 has more replayability if that matter to you as far as stretching your dollar. I dont find myself excitingly opening cyberpunk. I felt like 1 playthrough was enough to get a big grasp of the game.
Unpacking,"Rdr2 is a masterpiece. It’s slow paced but if you adapt your speed to it, rather than trying to force it to your speed, it’s fantastic! It is the most alive environment of any game I’ve played. Can interact with just about everything too. And npc’s actually seem like they are more than objects moving around the screen."
Unpacking,RDR2 is one of the greatest games ever made.
Unpacking,"I have both. The answer is both. Just get both, play them both for less than two-hours each, and refund the one you don’t want."
Unpacking,"Unquestionably RDR2 is the better, more fully realized game. 

I think the best question to answer from a prospective standpoint, however, is what is your preferred gaming experience? Do you like 'slow' as a concept? Do you enjoy being diverted from whatever you initially planned doing? If a game world is both fun and immersive, are you happy with killing an hour or two wandering around it and not focusing on story progression? If yes to all of the above, You will love RDR2. If you are very task oriented and want everything to be a quick hit, then RDR2 isn't going to be your cup of tea regardless of its (excellent) level of quality.

That's generally what people mean when they say this game is divisive. The less patient get frustrated with its deliberateness."
Unpacking,Wait until the Cyberpunk expansion comes out at a discount. It will probably be in its best state at that point.
Unpacking,"Red Dead 2 all the way. It took me like 3 attempts of replaying the beginning before I finally got hooked on the game and I wish it didn’t cause I’ve been missing out! 

It’s such a beautiful game. The guns are dope, (just experiment, you can’t lose unless you don’t like the gun which you can just store away) and the world is vast but alive

Like you’ll suddenly get ambushed or some fools will try to rob you; or woodcutters are felling trees, or a criminal is complaining on the back of a horse tied up"
Unpacking,I played both RDR2 on s a great experience but a little slower pace. Cyberpunk was broke and I fell off before I completed it
Unpacking,"Both are on sale pretty often but I would do RDR2 first without question. There are certain games you absolutely have to at least play. Don’t have to finish it if it don’t click but it’s an absolute must play. Cyberpunk is a great story with not the best gameplay, plus very raunchy. It’s gotten much better over the years however."
Unpacking,Red dead 2 is leagues better imo
Unpacking,Rdr2 is probably the best story in a game I have ever played. Full stop. It is genuinely one of the most amazing game stories there is. I would recommend it over cyberpunk based on that alone
Unpacking,Red Dead 1st by far
Unpacking,"Imo they are both very enjoyable from a story and gameplay angle. Some of it comes to taste (do you want a Wild West game or futuristic urban environment?). In my opinion you can’t go wrong but there is a reason Red Dead 2 is considered one of the greatest single player games of all time. 


Also, if this matters, cyberpunk is a 30-50 hour game if you complete the story and do a lot of side quests. Red dead 2 is more of a 50+ hour kind of game."
Unpacking,RDR2
Unpacking,I would say red dead now and cyberpunk later
Unpacking,"Cause I don't play video games no more
Never play video games
But Red Dead Redemption 2, that is not a game
It's an incredible journey through old American history
Fighting for your life and fighting for your family
Try to live your days with honor and integrity
That's not a game, that's an adult thing
That's not a game at all
That's like fuckin' Shakespeare
- Jack Black"
Unpacking,"Objectively RDR2 is the better game in almost every way, and it’s also cheaper right now. But man I can’t help but absolutely adore cyberpunk, even more than red dead. My brain says get red dead but my heart says get cyberpunk"
Unpacking,"Cyberpunk is pretty cool, but RDR2 is a goddamn masterpiece."
Unpacking,"If you like first person action RPG and sci -fi allot like I do Cyberpunk carried the magic. After the millionth plot twist I gave up on Rdr2, cyberpunk is short sweet and tragic."
Unpacking,I would say get red dead. It honestly looks like the better game out of the two and you can always get a refund if you really don't like it.
Unpacking,"Red dead 2, 100%"
Unpacking,Could not put RDR2 down finished in under a month. Cyberpunk took me at least 4.
Unpacking,99.9% of time my answer to this sub is just r/piratedgames
Unpacking,rdr2 all the way
Unpacking,Red Dead Redemption 2 !
Unpacking,Rdr 2
Unpacking,Both are amazing and should be played but get rdr2 first and wait till the new dlc to get cyberpunk.
Unpacking,"RDR2 is to date the best single game I’ve ever played by far.

It’s a masterpiece."
Unpacking,RDR2. Without a doubt.
Unpacking,RDR2
Unpacking,Do you want rootin tootin cowboy shootin or stressy messy cyborg depressy?
Unpacking,"I love both, but cyberpunk is good and RDR2 is next level amazing."
Unpacking,"In between missions, RDR2 is quite therapeutic to play."
Unpacking,"Late to the party, but would like to share my thoughts:

CP2077 has some fantastic writing and beautiful graphics. That being said, it’s a very shallow game in every other department. Given the world-building, it has amazing potential. If they had just given the game another couple years to incubate, it easily could’ve been one of the greatest action-adventure RPGs of its time. 

RDR2 is, on the other hand, *also* a game that has fantastic writing and beautiful graphics. It is, however, the type of game that *did* get the time it needed to fully flesh out all the other aspects of its gameplay. The result is a highly immersive experience with a lot of replayability and content that can last you hundreds of hours."
Unpacking,"It's not even really a fair comparison. 

RDR2 is a ridiculous rich and developed world with unbelievable detail (sometimes to much) and a story that is extremely engaging. It also has some of the best NPC reactions/interactions and is probably one of the top 3 hunting games in the last decade all rolled into one.

Cyberpunk is a mostly dead world with poor interactivity with npcs, a convoluted story that barely makes sense, and is almost entirely empty. I know I mentioned dead and empty twice but it needed repeating. The game had so much potential it didn't live up to its ridiculous. The games AI is almost as bad as basic vanilla skyrim back in the day. Luckily most of the bugs seem to have been dealt with but the game is still not worth buying in my opinion"
Unpacking,I've played both. They're both pretty good. Rdr2 is the best of the 2.
Unpacking,def red dead!
Unpacking,I have never met someone who didnt like rdr2 but cyberpunk seems to be hit or miss i have friends who love it but i have had no enjoyment playing it at all
Unpacking,"Cyberpunk is one of my all-time favourites, but Red Dead II is objectively the GOAT"
Unpacking,RDR 2 and don't think twice. Cyberpunk is good but RDR2 is a masterpiece and goated.
Unpacking,"I haven't played Cyberpunk yet, but RDR2 is a must play. I held off on playing RDR2 for a long time, due to people saying its slow paced. That was a mistake. I didn't feel slow to me, because the story is so good. If it was a movie, it would get an Oscar."
Unpacking,Rdr2 first and then cyberpunk
Unpacking,RDR2 no contest
Unpacking,RDR2 is at minimum a top 10 all time must play game
Unpacking,Red dead is wayyyy better than cyber.
Unpacking,"10/10 ""wild west"" (kind of) open world with a 10/10 story or a, well, cyberpunk open world with a 9,5/10 story


your call"
Unpacking,"Rdr2 is amazing. Cyberpunk is great and one of the better open world games I've played ever. I've played a lot of games and I adore this game. Wasn't perfect obviously with the console bugs but it's still great. If you're on pc then get it,next gen consoles then yeah. Previous gen then definitely no. 

After playing both, I can say both are great and damn good games. RDR2 is a masterpiece and Cyberpunk could one day end up being remembered as one. If not for the bugs and launch issues then kt would've been perfect imo"

Unpacking,"Cyberpunk is one of the more fun games I've played in years.  Red dead redemption 2 is the single greatest game I've ever played. Play both, but start with red dead."
Unpacking,How much is rdr2? I just bought it for $70? 😭😭😭😭
Unpacking,Anyone who is a gamer must play RDR2
Unpacking,Cyberpunk. That's just me though. This is really a question you need to ask yourself.
Unpacking,"Well I would say both, but I would suggest leaving cyberpunk aside until Phantom Liberty comes out and you can experience it at its highest. So for now, I recommend Red Dead. It's very fun, finished it recently, couldn't put my controller down, one week of my holiday gone, spent 110 hours on the game. Just don't overwhelm yourself and don't rush too much with the story, just enjoy the game's atmosphere and its randomness and progress in the story in whatever way feels best to you.

If you worry about completionism, I recommend making a manual save for everytime you start a new chapter."
Unpacking,Cyberpunk has finally gotten out of the shadow of its launch and is finally the game it was promised to be. But RDR 2 would be Rockstar’s masterpiece if the first game and GTA V didn’t already exist. Definitely check both games out but give Red Dead Redemption 2 a try first.
Unpacking,I liked Cyberpunk a lot but RDR2 is the way to go
Unpacking,Cyberpunk only because it going to get a overhaul that makes the game worth playing but red dead 2 is hella fun as well so wouldn't blame you if you got that over it since cyberpunk started off bad and kept people off it.
Unpacking,RDR2. It has an amazing story.
Unpacking,I haven't played Cyberpunk but RDR2 is such a masterpiece so that's my vote :)
Unpacking,Red Dead Redemption is a masterpiece. Cyberpunk in its current state is fine but nowhere near RDR2 level.
Unpacking,RDR2
Unpacking,"I played both, and 110% would pick RDR2 over cyberpunk. I think I’ve replayed it 4 times now. Played through Cyberpunk once and haven’t felt much like going back. Just a richer story in RDR2."
Unpacking,"i know everyone and their mom has already said it in this comment section, but i’m gonna add my voice to the choir anyways: rdr2 first, without a doubt."
Unpacking,RDR2 is great. would never spend money on cyberjunk
Unpacking,Rdr2 is slow as fuck cyberpunk is fast paced so i would go for cyberpunk (haven't been a fan of slow paced walking and riding Sims no matter how good the story is if they can't give it to me in a faster manner or keep me retained i ain't bout that)
Unpacking,RDR 2
Unpacking,"Wow, someone needs to rep cyberpunk here.  I loved it.  Best game of last 5 years for me.

Rdr2 was boring for me.  Scenery was pretty and all but I just found it repetitive.  Ride horse, shoot, do boring camp stuff, etc.  I dunno I like doing that stuff in real life.  

Cyberpunk is just super fun.  The soundtrack bangs.. you get swords implanted in your arms... the lore is super interesting.. lots of meaningful choices.  It's the only game I've ever replayed 

CP got a bad rap at launch.  I get it.  But on PS5 today it rocks"
Unpacking,"Cyberpunk will have a GOTY edition either with Phantom Liberty’s release or shortly thereafter. Acquiring RDR2 right now makes more sense, at least to me."
Unpacking,Buy rdr2 and when cyberpunk gets a complete edition buy that one later on
Unpacking,Both are incredible. I would not recommend getting Cyberpunk on a PS4 as it just stops working for me after like an hour of play time. RDR2 is a considerably better game but both are worth it
Unpacking,"Play RDR, then go to the second one - you won't regret it."
Unpacking,"I'm playing Cyberpunk rn and while id say it is a very good game and looks incredible, it is still nowhere near as polished as RDR2, combat, movement, interactions, npcs, customization and most of the things that make an open world/exploration game good are better in RDR2 in my opinion. But id still recommend you to get Cyberpunk later, it is a great game."
Unpacking,"Red dead 2, Cyberpunk isn't bad now, but RDR2 still has a good case for being the best game of all time."
Unpacking,I would get RDR2 first. Its long game with a much better story imo. Plus cyberpunk is getting that expansion in a few months that'll be overhauling some gameplay mechanics.
Unpacking,Cyberpunk.
Unpacking,"Red dead’s storymode is god tier, online can be amazing, Cyberpunk is very good, Perosnally I’d say red dead if you’ll play the online, cyberpunk if ur not gonna play the online"
Unpacking,"I say it depends on your system. I have a PS4 slim and cyberpunk is unplayable after the last large update. Gonna have to get a ps5 to actually play it. Could be my save corrupted somehow, but the game freezes after 20 minutes almost religiously."
Unpacking,RDR2 is one the best video games ever made. Definitely go for that first.
Unpacking,RDR2 any day of the week.
Unpacking,"Play RDR2 first and then buy Cyberpunk when the new expansion drops. I love both games, but it sounds like CP2077: Phantom Liberty will be the definitive edition"
Unpacking,"I would recommend both, but you need to play RDR2 if you haven't first"
Unpacking,Red dead redemption 2 a million times over cyberpunk
Unpacking,"RDR2, absolutely."
Unpacking,"I think cyberpunk and the expansion are on sale right now. But I’d go for rdr2 first considering it will be more instant gratification then having to wait till December for the expansion on cyberpunk, which will have a ton of new content meant to make the experience way better."
Unpacking,"Cyberpunk is poorly written, rdr2 is a masterclass"
Unpacking,RDR2 by a mile
Unpacking,"I played both games this year. I haven't finished Cyberpunk yet but it's pretty fun, I love everything about it except for some game breaking bugs and funny braindead AI. Both games are great but RDR2 is a triump; storytelling, characters, sound design, voice acting and impressive life-like world with a lot of details and hidden gems in it although gameplay is your standard Rockstar game, it's still an immersive game."
Unpacking,"I would recommend that you never buy cyberpunk and if Red dead is your thing, go for it. (It’s not my thing. But seriously, don’t buy cyberpunk.)"
Unpacking,Definitely Red Dead Redemption 2. Best game i have ever played since 2006
Unpacking,"huge cyberpunk fan here, i'd probably buy it when phantom liberty comes out since they're overhauling everything. RDR2 however was a masterpiece when it came out. definitely grab it, especially if on sale"
Unpacking,RDR2 will make you question if any game you ever played was good at all.
Unpacking,"Fair warning. I also say RDR2, BUT you need to go into it realizing it IS intentionally slower paced. Take your time with it, really invest in the characters and just hang out in the world, exploring and such. However, that said, I absolutely LOVE RDR2. It’s my favorite of all time."
Unpacking,Rdr2
Unpacking,"Both are really good 

I really enjoyed RDR2 a lot but Cyberpunk has something that really made me love it. 

I don't know if it's the setting or the overall dystopian world but it's a really great experience now

Plus Phantom Liberty is coming in september I believe so it might be worth a try"
Unpacking,"Both are on par and considered masterpieces of their own, CP story is more complex and fast paced while RDR2 is more of a slow burn kind of story. I think that CP is the superior game but I think you should buy both."
Unpacking,"Imo RDR2 is superior in essentially every aspect, I would definitely try it out."
Unpacking,Get both
Unpacking,"Definitely RDR2, seriously it contains the best protagonist you’ll ever play."
Unpacking,"Red dead is a must - cyberpunk is a should, so play RDR 2 first, then when the DLC is out pick up cyberpunk"
Unpacking,RDR2. I played both but for me RDR2 is just better.
Unpacking,"RDR2 barring it’s online is easily one of the best games ever made in my opinion. Same goes for RDR1, which can be played in either order. On top of that there’s undead nightmare as an added plus"
Unpacking,"I love both. But if I had to choose, it would be RDR2"
Unpacking,"Honestly both are really great games, you should pick based on what type of world you would like to dive into. Dystopian future, vs movie western."
Unpacking,Rdr2 killed my parents. We’re happily married now.
Unpacking,"RDR2 for sure!!!! I'm playing it again right now. Easily in my top 10 greatest games of all time. And with the amount of games I've played over 30+ years, that is really saying something."
Unpacking,Honestly they are both amazing In their own rights. RDR2 is considered one of the best games of all time tho so it’s an easy pick
Unpacking,"Obvious answer is rdr 2 first, but let me say this. No open world game will ever be the same after rdr2. Its miles ahead any game ive played to this day, technically and story wise."
Unpacking,"Both games are amazing. You can't go wrong with either - great storyline, great side quests, you can just dig yourself in for hours and hours. I'd highly recommend both. But if I had to pick one, I'd say RDR2. It left a bigger impression on me after finishing it."
Unpacking,"RDR2 is probably the better game from a technical standpoint, but I found the controls kind of kludgy to be honest.  I beat it once and have never felt the desire to replay it.

Cyberpunk on the other hand is the kind of game I can beat then immediately want to start a new character.  Yeah, it's undoubtably not as polished, but I just had more fun with it.  (Again, a big part of this probably just comes back to the controls, which were a lot smoother in Cyberpunk.)

Honestly...  You should just  get them BOTH!"
Unpacking,Rdr2 is easily the greatest console game ever made
Unpacking,"They’re very different games which is something to bare in mind. However, RDR2 is a much more polished product. I’d play that first and then pick up 2077/Phantom Liberty because they have basically said that the entire game is getting overhauled and polished with the next update/DLC in September. Both games will grip you emotionally as they’re very well written"
Unpacking,I played through cyberpunk twice. I stopped playing RDR2 when I got bored of riding my horsey.
Unpacking,Cyberpunk. Honestly RDR2 kind of bored me
Unpacking,And I will play it. Thanks for the reply.
Unpacking,Yeah what else is there to say? Although Cyberpunk is very enjoyable
Unpacking,I would say portal is a triumph.
Unpacking,"Sure, I guess then RDR2 it is. Thanks for the reply."
Unpacking,I won't pass on either but I guess first I will go through RDR2. Thanks for the reply.
Unpacking,I didn't feel the same. What is so unmissable about red dead for you?
Unpacking,To be honest it really depends. Personally I felt Red dead was a little to realistic for me and Cyber punk was more actiony.
Unpacking,">It will give you a thrill, make you feel like a badass, and then leave you in tears.

beautifully said."
Unpacking,Yes.
Unpacking,Same here it's hard to get into other games since I've played rdr2 I keep going back to it.
Unpacking,"Yeah, I guess waiting for the new update and dlc is the best option as new things will be added along with overhauls. Thanks for the reply."
Unpacking,What kind of depth does rdr2 have?
Unpacking,"Yeah. I just saw the dlc as pre-order along with Cyberpunk, but I think it will not be a great idea to buy it as they are adding and overhauling some features of the game in the next update probably. I guess waiting atleast till the update will be the right choice. Thanks for the reply."
Unpacking,I’ve just started the game is it best to wait for the DLC then and when does it drop ?
Unpacking,Phantom Pain is Metal Gear Solid. Cyberpunk 2077's expansion is called Phantom Liberty.
Unpacking,Do you know if ultimate version of RDR2 is worth it?
Unpacking,Any other game similar to rdr2 in gameplay? I love the sort of chill vibes with the option of action.
Unpacking,Careful it's CP2077
Unpacking,"Just a minor note that the outfit issue was fixed with a transmog function, so now you can play dress up and not just worry about stats.  But if you want to see your own outfit you have to drive a motorcycle."
Unpacking,Should I finish cyberpunk before the dlc?
Unpacking,"Yeah same here, RDR2 was amazing but I was way more immersed in Cyberpunk's world than RDR2's one 

Though both are really great games and should be played imo"
Unpacking,"Sorry to bother, but I would also like to ask which edition of RDR2 should I get. I will tell beforehand that I don't think I will be playing online version of the game."
Unpacking,I think most people agree that RDR2’s story is great and the strongest part of the game besides the visuals.
Unpacking,"Bruh. Who has the audacity to say RDR2 doesn’t have a good story?

It’s been widely, widely lauded as having one of the best stories in recent years"
Unpacking,"Thanks. I think story is subjective so might really like RDR2 too as I am not a huge fan of futuristic world. Though I am not a huge fan of Cowboys either (mediaeval fan here), though I might like it if I play it. Thanks for replying, I might get RDR2 now and wait for the update and expansion of Cyberpunk."
Unpacking,"I don't know about the story, but the best video game character is BT-7274. Period."
Unpacking,"This is how I feel. Cyberpunk was faster paced and I got more immediate gratification. I actually still haven’t gotten very far in RDR2 just because it has been slower-paced, but that being said, it is an exceptionally well-designed game"
Unpacking,"You’ve just described my exact experience. I really enjoyed RDR2 but we had just had our first baby when the it released - I just didn’t have the time and it fell by the wayside as a result, so I never finished it. Cyberpunk I managed to complete several times over on PS4 Pro and one more on PS5. Every single play through I’ve played completely differently to the last. It’s been immense. The sheer variety on offer with the story and the play styles means totally different experiences each time. While Red Dead is a beautiful and epic experience - it’s a fairly unilateral one. The only real variety coming from how many side missions or how much peripheral content you want to pursue. My wife played Cyberpunk more than I did - her sessions were vastly different to mine. I haven’t seen anything quite like it since the likes of Elder Scrolls."
Unpacking,“HANK! DON’T ABBREVIATE CYBERPUNK LIKE THAT! HAAAAANK!”
Unpacking,Not really. Where is the single player content?
Unpacking,"Same is experience. RDR2 more polished and you interact with more things, and NPC has better reactions. But cyberpunk is just more fun to play.

My biggest issue with rockstar games is that on rails and very linear. That’s being said they still quality games and will buying the next Rockstar game when it comes out."
Unpacking,You can always turn off aim assist for a better challenge in RDR2
Unpacking,What do you mean by terrible gameplay in RDR2?
Unpacking,"Yeah, just saw the amount of things they are adding in the update and expansion. Some of it is overhaul of current systems so I guess waiting for the update and the dlc is the best thing for now. Anyways, I would like to ask one more thing, should I buy RDR2 on Epic store or Steam because as far as I have heard, Epic store has a really bad mod support for games. And I guess there some fine mods for RDR2 so would like to get my hands on them. Thanks."
Unpacking,"> game i *paid* for. So

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*"
Unpacking,"I played the game about a year ago and only experienced like 5 bugs, none of them even being close to game breaking"
Unpacking,I bought and played a month or so ago and experienced almost 0 bugs. I think one quest messed up and that was it. After the most recent patch it seems pretty good. Also looks amazing with the ray tracing.
Unpacking,">the janky controls are super frustrating and honestly it’s pretty slow at times. I don’t need to watch long animations every time I pick something up or do anything. It’s more cowboy sim than game.  
>  
>Tried it 3 times and never make it past 10 hrs or so.

Not every game is made for you."
Unpacking,you think cyberpunk is a fail because of first week youtube videos and headlines. mostly everyone that plays the game says it is on track to becoming a no man's sky type revive
Unpacking,Cyberpunk absolutely does not have better writing…
Unpacking,no reason to skip one of the greatest games of this generation
Unpacking,"How is it overrated, there’s no game that has that level of detail, i can understand not enjoying the slow paced gameplay, but you can’t deny that no game has pushed the boundaries of open world like red dead in terms of immersion."
Unpacking,sure buddy go play ludo
Unpacking,You're getting hate but it's true. RD2 felt more like an interactive movie than a game.
Unpacking,"For reference, I have played both and love both, I even lean towards rdr2, but I am recommending based on OP's interests, unlike most of you"

Unpacking,I’ll be honest I thought RDR2 was a tedious piece of trash and nothing like the first game. Cyberpunk   Is more fun and you’ll want to play it more.
Unpacking,"Cyberpunk is getting a big expansion in September, along with a huge update that overhauls the whole game pretty much. Definitely hit RDR first and then grab cyberpunk after the update sometime."
Unpacking,Great story.  Great gameplay.  Great experience overall.
Unpacking,"I think it has some serious flaws but most of those flaws are in line with the vision of the game rather than being oversights. Like all the animations and forced walk sections, or the controls not being very arcadey with no jump button. The main flaw that defies this rule is the absurdly on-the-rails quests, which are typical for Rockstar.

All of that being said, it was in many ways a masterwork. Unparalleled attention to detail. Felt great to explore and discover. Could sink absurd hours into it or just pick up and play, and either way is fun. I find myself coming back to it all the time and finding things I missed.

It was imo the first Open World to feature both breadth and depth in world design without being riddled with bugs. You can tell the crunch went into perfecting the details rather than throwing the game together.

Gameplay and story not revolutionary but consistently solid."
Unpacking,It’s an absolute masterpiece.
Unpacking,"I've played and beaten both, and I love both games. That being said RDR2 is a fucking masterpiece. I don't know any game I'd pick over rdr2 in a one on one."
Unpacking,"It's probably the deepest and most fully realized open world ever crafted, filled with rich and compelling characters, emergent choices, and awesome things to discover. It's held up by many experts as one of the iconic examples of video games as art. But go off, chief. Contrarianism is all the rage."
Unpacking,"It would be easier to list what components of RDR2 *do not* have depth:

Enemies - it's all pew pew guys across the board.

Mounts - it's all horses across the board.

As for narrative, gameplay, world building, world interaction, customization, side missions, character developments, npc interactions, etc. etc. etc., I could go on but I've given your clearly catty, insincere comment enough effort and time, maybe just become more interesting in the future and open up with a compelling point next time."
Unpacking,September 26.
Unpacking,Haha very true that was a Freudian slip!
Unpacking,"If you can get it cheap then maybe but I don't think it's worth it, personally."
Unpacking,Rdr1 is the only one I can think of
Unpacking,GTA
Unpacking,Death Stranding I suppose both tedious games but are top 3 for me
Unpacking,Oh that’s good to know. And thanks for the correction
Unpacking,No they plan to overhaul the ai and make other changes. (Better Skill tree for example)
Unpacking,"In which case, the cheapest version. The ultimate edition just has online content iirc"
Unpacking,"Is the story really good or are the characters just carrying everything? Playing rn and the story is kind of meh. Rockstar games never really had a great main story, but that is not necessary with all the fun.

Not saying I'm right, just how I am feeling right now."
Unpacking,[deleted]
Unpacking,"Many actually. And even as a huge fan myself, I understand that the pacing of that story is all over the place and many of my friends drop it after initial 2-3 snowy hours and I keep on trying to convince them."
Unpacking,"When I was contemplating rdr2 I felt like you. I also was unsure about the horse riding mechanic, as I was used to GTA and using vehicles. And I was unsure I would enjoy the 1899 setting. But let me tell you, get this game! It’s so good. You will end up being fascinated with the world, including the horse riding."
Unpacking,"I've tried to get into RDR2 multiple times, I really appreciate the quality and complexity of the game, but I just can't, because I find the entire cowboy setting to be boring and uninteresting."
Unpacking,"The game was so good and complete at release, it didn’t need it."
Unpacking,"There's a reason why they made auto aim the default in RDR2, because the combat is so clunky that it needs it"
Unpacking,It’s a very boring gameplay that’s for sure.
Unpacking,Mainly because the mission design and combat are so bad
Unpacking,"I play on PS5, so I wouldn't know much about epic store vs steam. Maybe try asking on the Red Dead sub, they will probably give better answers than I could"
Unpacking,You can mod pretty much everygame on steam just as well if not better than epic. Some games even have steam cumunity mods through the steam store such as l4d2. Really the only reason id choose epic over steam for anything is if epic is giving a game away for free and even them there are some cases where id still just rather buy it from steam.
Unpacking,Good bot
Unpacking,The freind i borrowed it from said the same thing so i guess it varied from person to person. My experience was a mess. Nothing game breaking in the sense that i couldn't progress but a lot of religing becouse i got stuck in terminals and uis. Also had this one where jackie always had his gun out no matter what animtion he was doing or where he was. Even had it on that mission where we coukdnt bring our guns. Nothing could have been done to fix that one just had to accept that that was jakie now for that playthrough
Unpacking,"Im with this guy, never had any game breaking bugs in this game from day 1. Playing PC with a good gpu over on my end tho. If youve got a 30 series gpu or newer cyberpunk runs literally fine"
Unpacking,Yeah thats one thing i can personally attest to it looks really good. Also it supports dlss 3 fram generation so it runs really smooth a 4000 series card.
Unpacking,"This is a stupid fucking reply

Nowhere did they say that. They're allowed to criticise the controls of a game when someone asks for opinions on that game. Opinions from both sides are important when deciding whether to buy something or not."
Unpacking,Never said it was.
Unpacking,It's widely agreed the controls and combat are super clunky.
Unpacking,"Opinions are opinions my dude, both games had amazing writing but I felt more connected to Cyberpunk."
Unpacking,Guess the opinions are divided. I didn't like rdr2's writing very much. What was so great about it then?
Unpacking,I agree about the level of detail. For sure it's impressive in that aspect. It's just soooo fucking slooow man. I almost didn't finish that game considering how tedious it was. I'm sorry.
Unpacking,Ok
Unpacking,"Tedious as f... imo. I almost didn't finish it, but the story got me through. Gameplay was the worst!"
Unpacking,"Weird, I was raised by fast paced shooters and such and absolutely adored rdr2 despite its slower nature."
Unpacking,"Want to cook some food? 10 minute animation per piece cooked. Want to loot something? 10 minute animation of you picking the body up. Want to skin an animal? 45 minute animation. Oh, and btw, you need hundreds of pelts if you want to do side content. It is the most ridiculous shit.

Everyone kept telling me I needed to get to chapter 2 to really get a feel for the game. I made it past chapter 2 and I still hate the game. Only now I'm past my refund window and hate it even more now.

Every mission is you riding with some member of your crew on horseback for 45 minutes while you get gigantic exposition dumps. RDR2 is the game you get when you distill the WORST parts of the GTA franchise down into a cowboy game.

This was the first game that was universally praised, in a genre I love, that I hated to it's core. It has me questioning whether or not i should even bother buying the last of us on PC."
Unpacking,Where are details on the huge update? Can’t seem to find any but very interested
Unpacking,Still playing cyberpunk on a console like ps5 is like playing in a ghost town. If OP has a decent rig he should definitely hit cyberpunk in September.
Unpacking,"Wasn't this supposed to come out this month? I am very excited about the DLC, but I'll believe the release date once I've downloaded it."
Unpacking,"Will they completely drop their sad excuse for an armor system, their sad excuse for a weapon system, and their sad excuse for a perk system? Oh wait… that’s like every system in the damn game. Would be silly to ask for that.

Edit: holy shit it looks like they are!"
Unpacking,"I thought it was very visually impressive and well acted. Also the soundtrack fucking slaps. I love the soundtrack. It also usually managed to capture the intended vibe very well. But it wasn't very thought-provoking. And some of the side content just completely misses the mark. 

Cyberpunk is a lot less polished and pleasant. But some of the sidequests could have carried entire high-quality indiegames."
Unpacking,"Trailing missions, long ass point a to point b travel, goofy ah shooting, extremely linear missions, breaking the games economy with that stage coach robbery mission. Can’t deny the flaws."
Unpacking,Did not know a simple question was a clearly catty insincere comment....
Unpacking,"Lol what a pathetically insecure reply. RDR2 has absolutely zero depth when it comes to gameplay, mission structure, level design, or npc interactions. It’s all shallow set dressing for a pretty decent story that would’ve worked better as a TV series. As an actual videogame, it’s average at best."
Unpacking,"> I've given your clearly catty, insincere comment enough effort and time, maybe just become more interesting in the future and open up with a compelling point next time.

You’re right - how dare he ask a simple question about your favourite game?! The audacity of /u/ihave0idea0 knows no limits! 

Personally I find RDR2 wholly unappealing to me, mostly because what I’ve seen of the combat mechanics seems quite repetitive and more importantly not skill-based.  
But I also don’t like the Elder Scrolls series or Cyberpunk for the same reason, so this thread just isn’t for me."
Unpacking,"Yeah, been through that. And online doesn't do it for me"
Unpacking,I actually have that. Might give it a try
Unpacking,Oh I’ll wait then damn okay thanks.
Unpacking,Thank you very much.
Unpacking,"It’s definitely more character driven than plot driven. It might take a while for the story to get going, but when it does, it’s really some of the best dramatic writing I’ve ever seen in anything. It’s worth sticking with for sure."
Unpacking,"… that’s what a story is, a journey of characters through an arc. The plot of 99% of stories is the same basic shit."
Unpacking,"Fair, I can’t seem to get into Witcher 3, despite being a huge fan of the lore and gameplay.

It just… feels so huge and cumbersome"
Unpacking,Yeah the story feels very disjointed. You do like 5 completely unrelated main story missions and then eventually come across another mission that advances the story. How’s that a great story? I get that people like those unrelated main missions since they like long games and are willing to tolerate a somewhat disjointed story if it means a longer game. But you can’t tell me that’s a good story. A good story must have a good flow.
Unpacking,Rdr2 is easily top 5 of last gen
Unpacking,"Yeah it's not even gameplay.
Just high quality movie"
Unpacking,Tried that but didn't get any answer. Other modding subreddits had no idea either. I guess I will try asking there again. Thank you very much.
Unpacking,"Actually had a coupon on epic store, so wouldn't want it to go to waste. I have some other the list but would live to know if epic store version can be modded. The RDR2 subreddit seems kinda dead with most of the posts with no replies so I think I might not get one there either."
Unpacking,Best bot
Unpacking,">This is a stupid fucking reply

Exactly my thoughts lol.

I absolutely loved RDR2 but I can totally see how it can be boring for some people. In fact, I've seen plenty of comments on various subs saying exactly that, so I think it's important thing to highlight for OP."
Unpacking,"It was cool at first but then I just got tired of it quick. I also work 50hrs a week with like 1 hour commute one way so I just don’t have time for slow games anymore. 
That being said getting off a horse just to pick something up every time is just an awful game play design."
Unpacking,What a debby downer you are. Pessimistic much? Lol
Unpacking,Valid
Unpacking,"[Check it](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/147domj/everything_new_with_phantom_liberty_and_patch_17/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)

I’m pretty excited"
Unpacking,It says September 26th on steam. Even if you don't get the DLC you still get access to the massive overhaul btw.
Unpacking,I think the side content is amazing. Maybe some things could be better but it is very good
Unpacking,"Yeah I get that but thought provoking is not what I expect from Rockstar, or any game outside of select RPGs.

It’s more like a great execution of a tried and true formula. If I wanted a thought provoking Western, I’d reread Blood Meridian, not play an open world game."
Unpacking,There’s nothing thought provoking about Cyperpunk either
Unpacking,They’re not flaws…  They’re features!
Unpacking,Yeah rockstar hasn't improved it's gameplay since GTA San Andreas. It's a shame because visually and story wise the games are brilliant
Unpacking,"It's not a simple question, it's probably the most highly praised game of the last decade, pretending that you know nothing about it whatsoever and have decided to randomly come to me to learn more about it is naive and stupid at best."
Unpacking,"And this is the kind of dumbass mentality that went behind asking 'hurr, what kind of depth rdr2 got?'"
Unpacking,"The OP asked which game should he play, not your emotional personal take that doesn’t help at all and literally NO ONE cares about"
Unpacking,I hear you. Just the most similar gameplay I could think of. Basically the same game at a different time period with different technology.
Unpacking,"Story wise, propably. Gameplay, definetly not."
Unpacking,I dont see why not you wouldnt be able too. Modding alters your local files on your system so i feel like whichever store front you bought it from wouldnt matter. All the games ive ever modded were on steam but i never had to actually interact with steam to do it so i feel like the same processes would have worked even if i bought them from epic.
Unpacking,"Fair enough, that horse thing is true"
Unpacking,"Everyone I know loves this game. So I never criticize it around them, because I would feel like a debbie downer. It was just exciting to finally see someone else hate it."
Unpacking,Everything he said is valid and he’s entitled to his opinion. That isn’t pessimism
Unpacking,"The shredder of panda guy I’m replying to blocked  me, then reported me to Reddit for some kinda wellness check?? People are so weird.. wtf"
Unpacking,"Thank you. 

Man I am hype now."
Unpacking,I'm happy for you. That I didn't feel the same doesn't mean I want to take that away from you
Unpacking,"I don't think thought provoking was something they were not trying to do. The story of the main characters in what is essentially a cult was compelling but just not for that long. 

Also looking at cyberpunk again. I think there are plenty of moments there that could be labeled thought provoking. 

Maybe I just wanted the wrong things from the game."
Unpacking,"No? What about Joshua's quest line? Rivers quest line? The quests with the mayor and his wife? V's story, the different endings. Even the quest with the vending machine ends up asking some interesting questions."
Unpacking,Let’s hope for gta 6 I personally didn’t like rdr2 as much as other people did for personal reasons but I still thought it was a fantastic game
Unpacking,"Damn, you even double-downed on it.

People ARE allowed to not know everything about RDR2, man.

You clearly spend a lot of time thinking about your favourite video games - that’s fine, but you should realise that other people may have other interests and may actually not know much about it, if at all.

As I said I personally find the gameplay uninteresting (not sure how you can think it has a lot of depth, tbh) - and a game without good gameplay is just a bad game to me. Therefore I have little interest in Rockstar games in general, because their gameplay is usually super casual-oriented.

As for the rest of you description of the depth of the game, you used a bunch of buzz-words but didn’t actually explaining anything to the guy.

Good graphics, good story, world building, character development and voice acting are great, but if that’s all there is to it, I’d rather watch a movie or read a book tbh. Gameplay is where games are at for me, and a lot of people in general."
Unpacking,"Did you mean to reply to someone else?

How am I the emotional one for replying to someone having a complete meltdown at the mère idea that someone didn’t know the alleged qualities of RDR2?

I explained why I thought that neither games thought of by OP were particularly good in my opinion. That’s very relevant to the discussion.

What’s the point of your needlessly aggressive comment that no one asked for and no one cares about, to use your own words?"
Unpacking,Exactly. However I think my emotional investment was larger in rdr2. But time period doesn't really matter.
Unpacking,"Thanks for the reply. Just wanted to make sure. Actually, I heard and experienced issues with modding, especially with Bethesda games in Epic Games Store. And in general have heard people saying that Epic store is pretty bad if someone wants to play with mods. Modding for me is one of the main and most fun things (especially in games like Skyrim) so sometimes no excess to mods can be a huge deal breaker for me."
Unpacking,"""10 minute animation. 45 minute animation"". Yeah sure  that's real valid isn't it lol. Someone being overly negative and blowing something out of proportion is considered to be pessimistic to me. I never said he was wrong and couldn't have an opinion. I just called him a debby downer. I'm entitled to my opinion as well right?"
Unpacking,"Hey, what didn’t you like about the side content? I guess hunting is kinda barebones"
Unpacking,"Rivers quest was so boring. Go here, fetch this. Fetch that. Search the nephews room for clues. Snooze fest. It was nothing I haven’t seen before a million times. Most of the side quests were boring as hell. There were some cool moments, but thought provoking? Nah."
Unpacking,"Don't care, didn't read; get more interesting and stop leaning on sarcasm as a crutch for your lack of personality."
Unpacking,Continue with your non contributions. Op asked which game and here you are just wasting thread space
Unpacking,If you want to rant about how terrible RDR2 is make your own post
Unpacking,"Your making comments on someone’s character over a game, if anything you’re a Debby downer"
Unpacking,"Some of the sidequests were kinda stupid and unsatisfying. The one that stuck in my mind the most was the one where you encounter that woman who takes advantage of two guys with disabilities and the ark of the story is that the guys don't want to be with her because she's an absolutely horrible, abusive human being. Then when you find them they realise that they're still gonna go with her. 

Like what's the point? I had no input, the ark of the characters was to learn to put up with an abuser and it took like 20 minutes. 

&#x200B;

Not to say that I encountered no good sidequests. The one where you help a woman learn to live in the forest was lovely. But the game to me was littered with moments that ended in an unsatisfying anticlimax."
Unpacking,"Very interesting. What did you think of >!
Jackies funeral? !<"
Unpacking,"That comes from the guy that screeched and had a complete meltdown when someone else dared ask which kind of depth RDR2 had, because how dare he not know your favourite video game.

There is 0 irony in my last comment, btw! Not that I would expect you to understand irony…

Lmfao, reddit basement-dweller moment."
Unpacking,"What’s YOUR contribution, lad? What’s your purpose? Why are you commenting?

As I said above, I explained why I thought neither of the games were particularly good in my opinion. That’s highly relèvent on a sub where people ask whether they should buy specific games.

My comment is on topic. Yours aren’t and are just useless attacks with 0 contribution on the actual subject. Are you perhaps an alt of the other guy? That’s the o my way this would make sense, tbh. You’re weird"
Unpacking,"Ranting? For a whole 2 lines? Do you even know what a rant is? Open a dictionary ffs

The guy above had a meltdown when someone asked a simple question, I pointed out to him that no everyone necessarily liked every game or knew everything about every game.

That’s highly relevant to the conversation.

Once again, what is YOUR contribution here, apart from attacking me for no reason?"
Unpacking,You're making comments about my character over a reddit post. A bit hypocritical.
Unpacking,"Well, I didn't realize they had disabilities. Maybe I'm just stupid. I'm guessing your talking about the one where you had to keep punching and kicking those guys to prove which one was stronger? 

I saw it as funny, and I never saw them go back to her, I don't think I ever saw them after their final mission.  


Maybe I just didn't find them or I'm stupid. Oh well, I enjoyed those missions, and yeah that one with charlotte (woman in forest) was great."
Unpacking,Getting his bike was the best part
Unpacking,"No, you were in fact, weird because no one cares what you don’t like. I was genuinely interested in seeing how much people loved one game over the other but here you are."
Unpacking,I already gave my contribution
Unpacking,"My contribution was that I love both games but I feel like RDR two gets the one here because not only is it one of the greatest games of all time, but the story is pretty impactful"
Unpacking,My context might seem illiterate because I am using voice to text
Unpacking,"I think we're talking about another quest.  I googled it, it's called ""the smell of grease paint""."
Unpacking,"Intruiging. I absolutely love that quest for how real it feels. 
>! How it takes the time to mourn and speak to the people that this affected. Presenting a death so realistically gave so much validity to the rest of the world. It made me remember times I've lost people. 
Death in video games is never presented like this. !<"
Unpacking,"That sounds like a you issue, tbh

- Some people love one game more than the other

- some people prefer the other one

- some people like neither of them

These are all valid opinions on the exact same subject. I’m in the third camp, for reasons that I explained. I would therefore recommend OP to buy neither of these games if the reasons I gave resonate with him.

It’s hilarious that you don’t see that my comment is very much on topic for this thread - logic isn’t your forte, huh"
Unpacking,"Clearly not in this chain of comment, which is why I’m asking you what you’re even doing here."
Unpacking,"Fair enough! That’s understandable.

My contribution was that I didn’t like either of them for the reason stated above (gameplay isn’t interesting or skill-based enough, and that’s what matters most in games in my opinion), and therefore wouldn’t recommend either of them.

Don’t you see how my opinion is just as valid as yours? Again, why are you commenting here?"
Umurangi Generation,"I hated Generation Zero, it feels like a budget version of Fallout 76 at launch. Take all the good parts of launch Fallout 76, take it out, and you have Generation Zero. It's a large empty world where you'll spend more time walking in a straight line than doing anything else. Sometimes, rarely, you get to fight a robot."
Umurangi Generation,"I like it a lot, but the story isn't continuously told, super verbose or anything like that. It's *there*, but this game is way more about the combat and the tension of walking around hoping the big, scary robots didn't actually see you."
Umurangi Generation,"I played it for a few hours. I liked the premise and it has potential, but the game felt like an alpha build. Everything just felt very clunky and dated, like the game was made 2 gens ago. And it's not in English, it has English subtitles though. But the robots are cool. And yes, it is a walking simulator but you can ride a bicycle if I remember correctly."
Umurangi Generation,"The lads and I started a play through on it and stopped half way because it wasn't a challenge, even cranked to max difficulty, and was super repetitive.  I wouldn't recommend it.  It has a really cool 80s charm to it but, that only gets you so far.  We opted for Tiny Tina's Wonderland instead and enjoyed it."
Umurangi Generation,"Its on game pass if that helps at all, pay 10 bucks and you get it. Pretty sure new users get a month for a dollar"
Umurangi Generation,"I haven’t played it in ages and I’ve heard the whole game has changed a lot, maybe too much. There is even base building now and sad to see that the game is full of DLCs. Imo the map exploring felt like the Hunter COTW, lot of walking and sometimes having some fight with robots. Worst part was that most of houses and buildings were copy paste."
Umurangi Generation,No it’s trash
Umurangi Generation,I'm not really into game passe. I'm a bit of a game hoarder
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"I have both Slay the Spire and Steamworld Quest on Switch and haven’t had any issues with either on the platform. I think both are great games, but I personally prefer Steamworld Quest. 

Slay the Spire has very little in terms of progression, so once you get a grasp on the three characters and play through the acts a few times, I find there’s little reason to go back, so it didn’t take long for me to bounce off of it. The focal point of the enjoyment seems to be playing the three deck types repeatedly through the same dungeon, which doesn’t align with what I look for in my games, but I definitely see why it hooks others.

Steamworld Quest is certainly the easier of the two, but I’m having more fun with it. This is an old-school JRPG through and through, but each character is represented by their own small deck of cards, and the deck you play in battles are a mix of the decks from the three characters you chose for your party. It’s very cool! Unfortunately, the story is boring and pointless, so I’m finding myself speeding through text. However, the card battles are a joy and have me hooked. 

Hope this helps!"
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"I’ve heard Slay the Spire unfortunately has problems on the switch port.  Really love the game though! The PC mods for it are spectacular!

Googly eyes and playing as slime are perfect additions to an already great game!"
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"I normally really really dislike card games(and i normally dont like roguelites/likes) but Slay the Spire is a lot of fun! I would recommend picking it up, especially if it goes on sale"
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,I really enjoyed battle chasers. A straight up classic turn base rpg with at least enough replayability for two run throughs.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,I liked the dialogue :( It's a generic underdog hero story but it was charming as heck.
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,I was quickly turned off by the silly meta-humor and the story felt like it meandered along without much point or conflict. Perhaps I didn’t give it the opportunity to charm me in the same way. :)
SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech,"If it didn't grab you it didn't grab you. Everything about gaming is subjective.

I really like most ""generic"" stories though so that probably helped."
Thimbleweed Park,Bought it for my phone but didn't even finish it because i found it boring... But your choice
Thimbleweed Park,"It really depends on your tastes.   

Have you ever played a point and click adventure and liked it? Have you played classic point and click adventures like Monkey Island, Zak McKracken, Maniac Mansion and liked them? If yes, then definitely buy. If no, then maybe don't.  

Thimbleweed Park is made like a homage to classic point and clicks, and is created together with a couple of the ""legends"" of that genre (notably Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick). So it's rife with inside jokes, which you'll get if you played the aforementioned games (you can turn off ""annoying in-jokes"" in the settings in the game...)  

All in all: Yes, Thimbleweed Park is a great and fun game, but probably mostly appealing to people who like it for the nostalgia effect."
Strange Horticulture,RDR2 is an absolute triumph. It MUST be played.
Strange Horticulture,"I would generally recommend RDR2, which is one of the best games ever made.

Presentation is absolutely stunning across the board. Graphics, SFX, music, voice acting, all are absolutely stellar.

Gameplay-wise is also phenomenal. Essentially, to summarise, it plays as a 3rd-person shooter, with some RPG and simulation elements - it really shines in making you *feel* like the character you're playing as, that is, a cowboy in the late 19th/early 20th century, with all the gambling, outlawing, hunting, etc.

The content available is frankly some of the best value in any videogame. This is the most well-realised open-world game ever, in my estimation - an immersive world that feels natural and alive, that exists independently of you but reacts to your decisions. The story is fully fleshed out, dramatic, personal and intimate, but also self-aware enough to shine all the wild west tropes through. You have further an entire online mode that I haven't even touched yet.

When considering the preferences you laid out, I'm even more convinced you'll enjoy it. I'd recommend it over cyberpunk to anyone, but even more to someone with your preferences."
Strange Horticulture,"RDR2 is probably the better made game but I also loved Cyberpunk, it’s story, and it felt very creative and new. I liked someone else’s idea of doing RDR2 and buy Cyberpunk when DLC comes out so you can transition straight to DLC"
Strange Horticulture,"Love both, but I’d start with RDR2 buddy. And just know, it’ll be awhile before you start Cyberpunk once you get immersed into that work and Aruthur"
Strange Horticulture,U can miss cyberpunk. U cant pass on RDR2! Easy as that
Strange Horticulture,"Rdr2 without a doubt. The most beautiful open world, lots of chill out time, lots of random and very well written scripted quests, a sense of history with a bit of the absurd, and a tragic crime family story. It will give you a thrill, make you feel like a badass, and then leave you in tears."
Strange Horticulture,"I’m sure there will be a Complete Edition for Cyberpunk/Phantom Liberty, so wait on that. Cyberpunk was great; loved the story, Night City and the RPG elements. Granted I played on PS5 when that version was released. 

Red Dead Redemption II is one of the greatest games ever made. Five years later and it’s still worth full price. The quantity and quality of content is impressive."
Strange Horticulture,RDR2
Strange Horticulture,"As someone that was super hyped cyberpunk and hit it day 1, as faulty and buggy as it was at the time on my ps4, I enjoyed it, and now 100 times better with the next gen update and all on my ps5, that being said, RDR2 was one of the best games of the last generation, and it plays great on next gen consoles… definitely recommend RDR2, it’s not an rpg but getting lost in that world and along with the things you discover in it are very rpg like to me, definitely recommend RDR2"
Strange Horticulture,"RDR2.

Cyberpunk is cool, but it will be much cooler in a few months with the update/remake

I also would only get cyberpunk if you have at least a PS5/next gen/pc"
Strange Horticulture,Red dead redemption until cyberpunk dlc is released
Strange Horticulture,"No question, RDR2 all the way!"
Strange Horticulture,"I feel like RDR2 is a much better overall game, but is more divisive than you would be lead to believe. It's a slow burn story game, so if you're cool with that, it's way better.

Cyberpunk is exactly as you expect it to look and feel."
Strange Horticulture,"Cyberpunk base game is also been a lot of improvements when the DLC releases so get cyberpunk then with the DLC, for now its time for RDR2 Boah!!"
Strange Horticulture,RDR2
Strange Horticulture,RDR2 without a doubt
Strange Horticulture,"Red dead, even though I mostly play rpgs. Even though it’s fairly polished now I just find Cyberpunk to be boring. Idk I hope someday I can engage with it but it’s not now."
Strange Horticulture,"RDR2

Cyberpunk is also a very good game, and I do recommend you play it eventually

But with the DLC just around the corner (only three months away in fact) you should wait until it releases before getting it"
Strange Horticulture,"Wait for the DLC and play RDR2 while you wait. I personally liked Cyberpunk more, but RDR2 is amazing aswell."
Strange Horticulture,"Rdr2 and I liked both of them, but RDR2 is on another level"
Strange Horticulture,Rdr2
Strange Horticulture,"RDR2 is the most polished game I have ever played. The environments are highly-interactive and the world with it’s animals and people respond to you and each other in a very believable way. It’s story is an engaging epic action-drama grounded in reality. It’s extremely immersive.

CP2077 had very rough beginnings and, when I last played it late last year, that roughness still shows through on what otherwise feels like quite a nice game. Everyone knows about the bugs, so there’s no point mentioning them more here.  The physical environments and sound design are very well set up. But the NPCs populating the world will behave in ways that might break your immersion. When a gun is fired, they will all crouch in the same animation and despawn as soon as you aren’t looking. Police will spawn in on top of you when you commit a crime and don’t put up any chase when you flee. Feels disappointing in a world constructed around the notion of constant police-gang struggle. Supposedly this is slated to be reworked in the future.
The world has some interactivity more on par with games like dishonored 2. Dialogue feels particularly strong and the story is, in my experience, engaging. 
One strange thing is the character customisation. One premise of the world building is ‘fashion over function’. How you look is supposedly as important as how you act on the world of 2077. But this is totally at odds with the actual game mechanics. You will be heavily encouraged to wear clothes for their stats, not their appearance, and that will lead to some pretty weird costume combos. It doesn’t matter much because the game is entirely first person perspective, but that begs the (controversial?) question of why have a player model at all."
Strange Horticulture,Yes red dead redemption is much better on many levels right off the bat.
Strange Horticulture,Rdr2
Strange Horticulture,"Rdr2 100%. In my opinion it’s the best/most realistic video game ever made. The only downside is it’s ruined every game I’ve played after it. Either the graphics look terrible, the story is dumb, gaming mechanics aren’t as good etc.."
Strange Horticulture,"Hands down, RDR2. While I enjoyed Cyberpunk for what it is, I don't think that's a close call by almost any metric."
Strange Horticulture,"Red Dead Redemption 2 by far; I 100% Cyberpunk 2077, I did not 100% Red Dead.  Cyberpunk doesn't not have a lot of depth, unfortunately, its presentation is good and certainly has gotten better since launch but literally the only time I would even talk about it in the same breath as RDR2 is a question like yours, in terms of quality and depth and content, it doesn't hold a candle to RDR2.

There is of course a difference in setting to consider, but just keep in mind that while the 'cyberpunk' aesthetic is certainly present in Cyberpunk 2077, I'd argue it doesn't even do it as well as games like Shadowrun for SNES or Shadowrun for Genesis.  That may seem harsh, but again I did everything you could do in this game, it really doesn't have much going for it."
Strange Horticulture,RDR2
Strange Horticulture,"I would wait for the the dlc for Cyberpunk as it seems it will be some kind of mega side quest and will bring improvements to the base game as well, rdr2 is hit or miss I guess depending on people, it's a slow paced game but amazing visuals, story and immersion but with that said I finished cyberpunk and still will come back for the dlc, the game has a pretty big replayability if you like trying different approach to combat"
Strange Horticulture,"If you don't mind a slow burn for massive payoff then go for RDR2. You'll want to wait to play CP2077 until Phantom Liberty releases as they're doing an overhaul of the base game too.

Edit: Liberty not Pain"
Strange Horticulture,RDR2
Strange Horticulture,"No, it's not Next-Gen Optimized, but still RDR2 all day every day"
Strange Horticulture,"RDR2 is the superior game in my opinion. Cyberpunk is pretty bland in comparison. However, Cyberpunk has better performance in that, it can run at 60 fps on next- gen consoles (whereas RDR2 is locked at 30 fps) and is better optimized on PC, though still expect bugs. Also, RDR2 can be overwhelming with its size and detail, Cyberpunk is much smaller in scale."
Strange Horticulture,RDR 2 if you like a beautiful masterpiece
Strange Horticulture,"I just started RD2 on PC about a week ago and it’s absolutely sensational.

I do plan on getting CP after the new DLC comes out tho, and after I finish the main story in RD2!"
Strange Horticulture,You like computers or cowboys?
Strange Horticulture,"Seems like they’re going to add lots of fixes to the new gen consoles version of cyberpunk along with the expansion, so I think you should play RDR2 until a much better version of cyberpunk is out."
Strange Horticulture,RDR2.
Strange Horticulture,Red Dead Redemption 2
Strange Horticulture,"Wait for the Dlc of Cyberpunk, the game will get a massive overhaul with it"

Strange Horticulture,Red Dead 2
Strange Horticulture,RDR2 duh. CP2077 world and setting is unlike anything I've seen before so that's why I liked it but the story and gameplay was just ok to me.
Strange Horticulture,"RD2 

Wait for cyberpunks expansion and then get it. It’s a good game on its own. Think Skyrim but in a cyberpunk setting. Yes is failed on some major systems they were supposed to have. Supposedly they are reworking a ton which will drop with the new expansion in September"
Strange Horticulture,Red Dead. Definitely Red Dead.
Strange Horticulture,RDR 2 hands down!
Strange Horticulture,rdr2 for sure!
Strange Horticulture,Rdr2
Strange Horticulture,"I might get some hate, but i enjoyed cyberpunk way more than i did rdr2. Maybe rdr2 was too tedious for me, or i didnt like the setting so much. Not sure, still a masterpiece though. 
Still id get cp2077"
Strange Horticulture,Red Dead Redemption 2
Strange Horticulture,RDR2. By a mile!
Strange Horticulture,"There has recently (as in, this weekend) been an article about the Cyberpunk DLC. Along side it is an overall of almost every system. The state its in now, Cyberpunk is *fine.* The open world feels so dead and empty, with nothing ever changing. You can stand and watch a NPC for 5 hours, and they will not move from there spot. The gunplay is fantastic, and the story is good, although that's of course subjective) I think part of that will be changing, along with the many other little tweaks they will be making, along side adding the DLC. So I would hold off. 

&#x200B;

RDR2, in contrast is amazing. The story, combat, graphics are wonderful and I don't have much bad to say about the game. My only complaint is the pacing of the story. It drags on a little to much, but at the same time, that's kind of the point? So It seems a weird complaint. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, TL;DR- Buy RDR2, Hold of on Cyberpunk until the DLC is released"
Strange Horticulture,Red dead 2. That game is forever in my heart
Strange Horticulture,"If you like RPG games, go for cyberpunk. But if you want an experience go for RDR2. Many people say that rdr2 doesn’t have a good story, but I believe that it is amazing. But I think everyone will agree that rdr2 has the best protagonist of all time, Arthur Morgan."
Strange Horticulture,[deleted]
Strange Horticulture,"It took me almost 70h to complete the main story in RDR2 that is without any side missions or free roaming.

Done the cyberpunk main story a lot of side quests and done some free roaming all under 50h"
Strange Horticulture,Both are great but I'd wait for Cyberpunk fixes and qol that come with the expansion so RDR2 first
Strange Horticulture,"RDR2 is probably the better made game but I also loved Cyberpunk, it’s story, and it felt very creative and new. I liked someone else’s idea of doing RDR2 and buy Cyberpunk when DLC comes out so you can transition straight to DLC"
Strange Horticulture,"I completed cyberpunk 3x with lowered graphics and shit fps. (Roll on phantom liberty with a 3080)

I didnt finish RDR2s first? Second? Act.

Dont get me wrong, I think RDR2 is an amazing game, probably the better one, but these are the facts lol."
Strange Horticulture,Rdr2.  Then In September you can get CP when it gets somewhat overhauled by developers
Strange Horticulture,Why is that even a question? RDR2 should be the default answer to this.
Strange Horticulture,Get both honestly. They are both masterpieces of games. I personally enjoy Cyberpunk a lot more but they are both fantastic in terms of story and gameplay.
Strange Horticulture,Cp 2077
Strange Horticulture,"I'd go with RDR2 first and, depending on how much free time you have, by the time you're done with it there'll probably be some version of Cyberpunk with Phantom Liberty included. Either way you'll have a great time with both, enjoy!"
Strange Horticulture,"I admit that rdr2 is the better made game,  I just got bored by it.  Cyberpunk was way more fun and engaging to me. I played on a pretty good pc, and didn't really have any expectations going into the game,  so I wasn't soured by anything.

Rockstar games kinda just bore me tbh. After playing the ps2 gta games to death,  any Rockstar game after just feels like it plays the exact same."
Strange Horticulture,I love Cyberpunk and never had bug issues. You should 100% get red dead as it’s probably the best game ever created.
Strange Horticulture,Red Dead Redemption 2 is already a complete game. Cyberpunk still needs polishing and should be even more solid after the expansion comes out in September. RDR2 will hold you until then.
Strange Horticulture,"if u have a series console, ps5, or high end pc, get cyberpunk for 30$ plus the expansion for another 30$. if u don't have that, then id say RDR2"
Strange Horticulture,"Have both and played both.  
RDR2 is super immersive and so finely tuned - but it is an open world Rockstar game so it's going to be a bit overwhelming, at least it was to me.  
Cyberpunk is also open world but a bit more linear.  It has that Skyrim like maneuverability where things can get wonky but it allows the player more freedom. 

I'd say go for cyberpunk and just play it now so you have an understanding of the game and story before the dlc comes out."
Strange Horticulture,"I have both.

Cyberpunk is more of RPG style than RDR2. There's skill points and such to distribute. RDR2 increases stats for you based on what you do.

Cyberpunk's AI have health bars, red dead's doesn't. It's more immersive for that reason.

RDR2 is much slower pace, but has a lot more to explore. The scenery can be breath-taking and sometimes hard to fathom how good it looks. 

Cyberpunk has a lot of nothing, but it still looks pretty cool. Nice graphics.

So far, I like cyberpunk's story but it can seem a bit all over the place.

RDR2 has been easier to follow."
Strange Horticulture,"If you just want a decent story with an immersive world and nice graphics, RDR2 is fine for that. It has pretty terrible gameplay, and it's a brain-dead easy game that treats players like they have 60 IQ. If you just want to turn off your brain for 60-hours and play through a decent story, then it fits the bill. Especially if you like the wild west and spaghetti western movies, then you will probably like RDR2. 

Cyberpunk has way better art direction than RDR2, but the game is severely lacking in terms of a lot of its open world systems. It has nowhere near as immersive of an open world as RDR2. The setting and visuals are a lot cooler, but the actual execution isn't there. The combat is not very good, but it's at least better than RDR2 in this area. It also has RPG systems and build variety which RDR2 doesn't have. Overall I'd say just wait until the DLC drops, because apparently they have reworked a lot of aspects of the game. CP2077 really does have a lot of potential, so if the DLC lives up to the hype, then it could be a game changer."
Strange Horticulture,I just tried cyberpunk a couple weeks ago off a freinds familyshare and its still super buggy to the point where i wound up getting fed up with the bugs and uninstalling. I would have felt very cheated if it was a game i payed for. So i would go with RDR2
Strange Horticulture,"Everyone says RDR2 is the best game ever, but the janky controls are super frustrating and honestly it’s pretty slow at times. I don’t need to watch long animations every time I pick something up or do anything. It’s more cowboy sim than game. 

Tried it 3 times and never make it past 10 hrs or so."
Strange Horticulture,[deleted]
Strange Horticulture,Both
Strange Horticulture,Mount a blade bannerlord has great rpg mechanics you can literally be anything in that world
Strange Horticulture,I would only choose Cyberpunk solely because it has next gen support. RDR2 is a fantastic game but lacks that kind of support which makes me personally not touch it ever since I beat it back in 2018.
Strange Horticulture,"RDR2. It’s a much more immersive game and story. Cyberpunk is a great game too, but I don’t find the story as good at all. The pros about cyberpunk are extreme weapon customization and playstyle customization with perk trees. When I play RDR2 I feel like I’m in the story, and when I play Cyberpunk I feel like I’m in a gigantic beautiful sandbox game."
Strange Horticulture,Cyberpunk
Strange Horticulture,"RDR2 is much more story rich and interactive compared to cyberpunk. It only takes around 30 hours to complete the main mission, spoiler alert ( when doing the last mission after doing so you get back to prior of starting the last mission to finish anything else to basically you don't fully finish it). It has nice features, ray tracing, and a nice environment, but RDR2 beats it in every other way. That's from my opinion as i have both and played both for 100 hours plus on each."
Strange Horticulture,"Cyberpunk has better writing and combat. Rdr2's world is more detailed, alive and polished. 
I prefer cyberpunk.
Most people seem to prefer rdr2."
Strange Horticulture,"RDR2. Ive played both and Cyberpunk really lacks in a lot of areas and i didn’t get much enjoyment from it after completing the main story line. RDR2 however is a game that ive replayed numerous times and spent upwards of 400 hours combined playing, most of it in free roam. Havent even touched the online yet."
Strange Horticulture,"Cyberpunk's DLC will remain as a DLC, it seems to be set in a new city, but at this point, nothing can be done about the game's dullness and how unfun it is to play. I played it for 25 hours(right until the 3-race side mission were unlocked), and it's just boring, the plot is mediocre, the fighting, the gameplay are subpar, the only redeeming thing was how beautiful everything looked, and that's it"
Strange Horticulture,I would be cautious with RDR2 on PC. I had to get a refund on it due to the game constantly crashing; the issues had to do specifically with the Rockstar games launcher which you are required to use.
Strange Horticulture,"Rdr2 is a bit of an ancient game in terms of design. Missions force you to do things one way and if you don’t listen the game fails you. It’s also an aggressively easy game that just feels stiff and clunky mechanics wise. It’s got great voice acting, but I found the world and story pretty dull. Cyberpunk is a far more enjoyable game that gives you choices on how to handle each mission with much better combat and a much more interesting world to explore and a far more interesting story."
Strange Horticulture,"This is a hard one, gotta do both haha"
Strange Horticulture,neither buy rain world 😈😈
Strange Horticulture,RDR2 no contest
Strange Horticulture,"Depends, if you're on console I would skip RDR2, it still runs at 30FPS, rockstar doesn't care about next gen update."
Strange Horticulture,"Neither, buy doom eternal"
Strange Horticulture,I dont like rdr2 at all and like project red games
Strange Horticulture,Cyberpunk. Red dead 2 is overrated imo
Strange Horticulture,They’re both great go with what interests you more.
Strange Horticulture,I've played both and I have some stronger critiques on RD2 than most but would still pick it over CP.
Strange Horticulture,"Both games are amazing, i loved Cyberpunk it's story characters, scenery. currently playing RDR2 its really good, both games are great. I'd buy both if i were u"
Strange Horticulture,Robots and guns or cowboys and guns
Strange Horticulture,"I’d go for Cyberpunk personally. The game is really good as long as you take your time and do the side quests. There are a ton of really compelling stories that get told. I’d wait to play until Phantom Liberty releases though. The gameplay is already good, but it’s rumored they’re going to be shipping big improvements to key systems like the AI and the police systems (and possibly more) with the DLC."
Strange Horticulture,I recommend getting both
Strange Horticulture,"Both are incredible story games, depends on what you want. If you care about story and characters, go red dead, if you care about combat and replay ability go cyberpunk"
Strange Horticulture,"Rdr2, 100000%"
Strange Horticulture,Cyberpunk if you want action. Red dead if you don't mind watching a movie in game format.
Strange Horticulture,Rdr2 cyberpunk has a lot of problems
Strange Horticulture,RDR2
Strange Horticulture,Red dead partner!
Strange Horticulture,Red Dead is the better game hands down.
Strange Horticulture,RDR2
Strange Horticulture,Do you want to be a cowboy? If so…follow your heart
Strange Horticulture,Cyberpunk has a big DLC coming soon.
Strange Horticulture,"With the Phantom Liberty expansion, which overhaul all of cyberpunk. It will great to buy...


But RDR2 is a moderm masterpiece so it gets my vote"
Strange Horticulture,"Cyberpunk is more action and adrenaline, Red Dead Redemption 2 is more laid back and slow-paced.  


Cyberpunk has been getting updates continually since release and is awesomely upgraded by this point...I never finished RDR2, but I finished Cyberpunk and am waiting at the edge of my seat for Phantom Liberty, which is going to be a *huge* DLC and should be later this year.  


Cyberpunk.  My two cents."
Strange Horticulture,"RDR2, it's much more detailed and alive rather than cyberprank, tho I enjoyed cyberprank (played from friend's console) its just not within the same level of RDR2 also the balancing of story telling and action on RDR2 is peak unlike in cyberpunk you're always just sitting and listening"
Strange Horticulture,I don’t usually post on reddit but i just want to make sure that you get RDR2
Strange Horticulture,"Both are great, but I think Cyberpunk is the more engaging game. Red Dead suffers from the antiquated Rockstar game design. Almost no freedom during missions, you’re just railroaded through each section and must play it as the developers intend."
Strange Horticulture,Red dead 2 is my pick. Cyberpunk was fun but i can’t just sit back and enjoy the world like i can with RDr2
Strange Horticulture,"In my opinion, Red Dead Redemption 2 was an incredible experience, especially in the beginning and middle game. However, I found myself getting bored after reaching around 60% completion, as there weren't many new things to explore once I had acquired the best weapon. 

On the other hand, Cyberpunk had superior writing and enjoyable gameplay, but it did suffer from some noticeable bugs."
Strange Horticulture,"RDR2 and anyone who says diff is crazy ive completed both games and theres just nothing that compares to RDR2 everything about it is so amazing but for me my fav thing about the game was the story telling. the best storytelling ive ever experienced in a game hands down. it could of been a oscar winning film. i literally cryed during a few scenarios in the game,"
Strange Horticulture,Lol EASY choice. RDR2.
Strange Horticulture,Are you on pc ? If you don’t wanna keep the games forever. I can tell you how to get them for like 2$ both on steam
Strange Horticulture,"I vote rdr, as well. BUT, if you haven't played Witcher 3, that's another great one. Plus, it often heavily discounted."
Strange Horticulture,RDR2 and its not even close
Strange Horticulture,"Red dead 2. There isn’t a game that has immersed me more than this game, I play butt nekkid and pretend I’m a O’Driscol. 10 Cowboys out of 10"
Strange Horticulture,"I’ve played both and loved both, but I fully believe that RDR2 is truly the best game ever, go with that first!"
Strange Horticulture,"Rdr2 is very pretty and has some interesting things in it but from a gameplay perspective it's unbelievably barren. You don't even get to aim your gun in this game really and all the missions are basically ""walk here, listen to dialogue, kill guys"".

Cyberpunk at least has some depth to combat. It's a passable first person shooter. Not a great one mind you, but it works. The missions here are also just ""walk here, listen to dialogue, kill guys"".

Personally the dialogue in both these games puts me to sleep and that's like 70% of both. But I guess I would say the Rdr2 dialogue at least feels finished, whereas the cyberpunk dialogue very frequently feels like a placeholder."
Strange Horticulture,RDR 2 is a no brainer in this case
Strange Horticulture,"Cyberpunk over RDR2. While RDR2 is a great game, i found it slow, and alot of the “immersive” mechanics being pretty surface level and just boring. Unpopular take, but Cyberpunk is more fun."
Strange Horticulture,I’d wait till the new expansion for CP2077 comes out. It’s supposed to bring a whole bunch of QOL changes to the base game.
Strange Horticulture,RDR2
Strange Horticulture,No
Strange Horticulture,"RDR2 was fun, but I was more hyped for Cyberpunk 2077. Ended up not caring for RDR2 so much after burning myself out on it, but Cyberpunk absolutely failed me in almost every department. RDR2 is the way to go."
Strange Horticulture,"Wait for the cyberpunk dlc to drop before you buy since they are redoing A LOT of the mechanics. I believe it’s September 26 so you have a lot of time to finish red dead. Plus the summer sale is soonish I think so you might be able to get the game and dlc for cheap depending on what price they set. 

I’ve played both and even though it’s been a while since I played cyberpunk and I just finished red dead 3 days ago both are excellent games in their own right but I’d probably play red dead before cyberpunk."
Strange Horticulture,**\*\*\* me scrolling through the comments to find the crazy psychopath that chooses cyberpunk over rdr2 \*\*\***
Strange Horticulture,Cyberpunk is fun but it doesn’t come close to RDR2.
Strange Horticulture,"It depends on what type of games you like, red dead is more story based and polished, but cyberpunk is more ""fuck around and break the game"", but in a good way

Cyberpunk has leveling and a skill tree, and rdr doesn't, so I think you'd like it more

Also red dead was built with miracles or something because it runs like a dream"
Strange Horticulture,[removed]
Strange Horticulture,Both games are really good but RDR2 is my favourite game all time so pick RDR2
Strange Horticulture,"Both are great, but RDR2 is looong but with lots of content"
Strange Horticulture,Rdr2
Strange Horticulture,Cyberpunk is more fun. RDR2 gets crazy tedious
Strange Horticulture,"Red Dead 2 is worth its weight in gold. The story is perfectly told, with some of the best voice acting I've ever heard in a video game. The world is vast, and you never feel like you're completely out of things to do. Bored of missions? Hunt some animals for upgrades to both your player or your camp. Tired of hunting? Put your criminal mind to robbing a store or train. Want to help the law? Check the local sheriff's office for a bounty. The list of activities goes on and on...


So to answer your question, take a break from the cybernetics and neon signs of Night City and go on a breathtaking journey through late 1800's America with Dutch Van der Linde and the gang!"
Strange Horticulture,"Go with red dead and play cyberpunk after the last dlc comes out. There will probably some sale for a definitive edition down the line.

Both games are definitely worth to be played."
Strange Horticulture,Do you prefer cowboys or cyborgs
Strange Horticulture,Finished Rdr2 3 times already and would pay 200$to forget everything and start the game again without remembering anything. Cyberpunk I enjoyed the story but the game was full of bugs and lost the interest of playing it again even if it is fixed or not
Strange Horticulture,"I played red dead 2 after it had been out for like 4 years not expecting much. I didn't even buy it, I played my brothers copy, that's the only reason I tried it. It turned out to be my favorite game ever. I'm not particularly interested in the wild west. It felt like watching a movie in the best way possible. It's the only game I can think of where I was sad because I knew it was ending soon. I can't recommend it enough.

I was excited for cyberpunk for years. I was incredibly disappointed when I finally was able to play it, I put about 20 hours in it and feel no urge to continue playing it. Even after they've patched it."
Strange Horticulture,"All you need to do is listen to the song ""Video games"" by Tenacious D. You're welcome."
Strange Horticulture,RDR2. Cyberpunk's getting totally reworked head to toe alongside new DLC in September and *that's* when you should buy it.
Strange Horticulture,RDR2
Strange Horticulture,rdr2
Strange Horticulture,RDR2!
Strange Horticulture,Hmph. Rdr2 is a masterpiece. Cyberpunk quite literally is bad. Phantom liberty sounds very promising on paper but we’ll have to see. So did this game pre release and I’d give it a 5/10.
Strange Horticulture,Is this post by OP a joke?
Strange Horticulture,RDR2
Strange Horticulture,"Rdr2 has a much stronger plot and cast. And the world is gorgeous.

Cyberpunk is also fantastic and a lot of fun, BUT it’s a lot more you having to role play the character"
Strange Horticulture,"Loved both, but like everyone has already said, start with RDR2. CP2077 is a fantastic game, but it will get better once the Phantom Liberty update comes out."
Strange Horticulture,Rdr2 all day. By far my fav game all time.. online sux d tho.
Strange Horticulture,I couldn't get into RDR2 personally. I was enjoying the story and it's the most beautiful game ever made but I thought the gameplay and controls were so rudimentary I stopped at Chapter 3. Meanwhile I really liked Cyberpunk especially the story and although its gameplay isn't groundbreaking it didn't stop me from finishing the game.
Strange Horticulture,"Red dead, no doubt."
Strange Horticulture,RDR2 is one of the best games humanity has ever witnessed
Strange Horticulture,"Most people are saying RD2, but my vote is for Cyberpunk. Bugs aren't as bad now, and the story is great. Along with a bunch of different builds. You can be a ninja with a katana, a run and gun madman, or a tech savvy hacker. The atmosphere is great and helps tie everything together, and the characters you meet really make it amazing. Just like all of CDPR's games, they really go all out with side quests and side story characters. Plus, Phantom Liberty releases in September, so if it's on sale, I would go for it. Cyberpunk is by far one of my favorites, and honestly, RD2 doesn't even get close to my top games.
That being said, both Cyberpunk and RD2 are both amazing games. I just lean more towards Cyberpunk."
Strange Horticulture,"I say pick up Cyberpunk, it might be worthwhile to play the game now, with the original story, before playing Phantom Liberty. As Phantom Liberty is very likely going to come with some new endings, and possibly some other changes outside the ones we already know.

Plus I just think its a good game, well worth the money nowadays after 1.5. Mods make it even more fun to play around with. Just an entertaining experience.

On top of that Cyberpunk is truly an RPG, it lets you choose your skills, pick different perks, use different weapons. You truly build your character the way you want. Its very similar to thinks likeSkyrim in that way. Where as Red Dead 2 is just the same character no matter what, there is no leveling system or anything. Its really more of an action adventure title than a true RPG. 

So if you want to get immersed into an RPG and its setting, in similar fashion to things like Skyrim, I recommend 2077."
Strange Horticulture,RDR2 with no hesitation and do not read spoilers.
Strange Horticulture,"Hey unpopular opinion time. I played both.

RDR2 is certainly a marvel. The story is amazing, graphics are second to none, the protagonist is probably the most well flushed out I've ever experienced in a game, and overall the game really is a must play.

....but it's a bit of a drag yeah? It's very slow paced, and I found myself just wanting to play other games from time to time. This isn't really a negative point, and is definitely subjective, but man it can DRAG. 



Cyberpunk (post patches) is a wild ride. The story is a blast, and really kicks. The set pieces are way above what I expected in an open world game. The side quests, as expected from CDPR are just as good, if not better than the main story in many cases. Definitely a case of art direction trumping graphical fidelity. While it doesn't look bad by any stretch... Walking though Chinatown in the middle of the night is a sight to behold. Vibrant neon lighting, crowded streets, some guy getting mugged in an alley, the constant cacophony of people shouting and talking... I haven't felt that level of immersion in a game... Maybe ever.

Yeah it's a bit of a mess. But way better than the sum of its parts. Unfortunately I listened to the online griping, and missed out for longer than necessary, but take from someone who was hesitant, it blew me away.

At the end of the day Cyberpunk is just ***fun***. The shooting is chunky and effective, the driving is arcady but feels good, the plot and characters are fucking bonkers, and there really are just so many ways to play the game.

I played it the first time as a learning curve. A little hacking, a little shotgun, a little melee. It was pure chaos and really felt like I was a newbie in night city trying to climb to the top.

Second time thru and I'm playing full stealth. Feels like a totally different game. I walk in an alley, activate my speed implant, turn invisible, and walk through putting a bullet in everyone's head. Come out the other side, and watch the bodies drop before the cameras ever had a chance to catch me. Suddenly I felt like an elite level assassin that was born and bred in this world.


You can't go wrong either way, but I tip towards CP"
Strange Horticulture,"cyberpunk, rdr2 is a linear game in an open world setting with the most boring chapter 1 in existence, also everything you do (pointless animation) is so slow and infuriating that you can fall asleep"
Strange Horticulture,I think rdr2 has more replayability if that matter to you as far as stretching your dollar. I dont find myself excitingly opening cyberpunk. I felt like 1 playthrough was enough to get a big grasp of the game.
Strange Horticulture,"Rdr2 is a masterpiece. It’s slow paced but if you adapt your speed to it, rather than trying to force it to your speed, it’s fantastic! It is the most alive environment of any game I’ve played. Can interact with just about everything too. And npc’s actually seem like they are more than objects moving around the screen."
Strange Horticulture,RDR2 is one of the greatest games ever made.
Strange Horticulture,"I have both. The answer is both. Just get both, play them both for less than two-hours each, and refund the one you don’t want."
Strange Horticulture,"Unquestionably RDR2 is the better, more fully realized game. 

I think the best question to answer from a prospective standpoint, however, is what is your preferred gaming experience? Do you like 'slow' as a concept? Do you enjoy being diverted from whatever you initially planned doing? If a game world is both fun and immersive, are you happy with killing an hour or two wandering around it and not focusing on story progression? If yes to all of the above, You will love RDR2. If you are very task oriented and want everything to be a quick hit, then RDR2 isn't going to be your cup of tea regardless of its (excellent) level of quality.

That's generally what people mean when they say this game is divisive. The less patient get frustrated with its deliberateness."
Strange Horticulture,Wait until the Cyberpunk expansion comes out at a discount. It will probably be in its best state at that point.
Strange Horticulture,"Red Dead 2 all the way. It took me like 3 attempts of replaying the beginning before I finally got hooked on the game and I wish it didn’t cause I’ve been missing out! 

It’s such a beautiful game. The guns are dope, (just experiment, you can’t lose unless you don’t like the gun which you can just store away) and the world is vast but alive

Like you’ll suddenly get ambushed or some fools will try to rob you; or woodcutters are felling trees, or a criminal is complaining on the back of a horse tied up"
Strange Horticulture,I played both RDR2 on s a great experience but a little slower pace. Cyberpunk was broke and I fell off before I completed it
Strange Horticulture,"Both are on sale pretty often but I would do RDR2 first without question. There are certain games you absolutely have to at least play. Don’t have to finish it if it don’t click but it’s an absolute must play. Cyberpunk is a great story with not the best gameplay, plus very raunchy. It’s gotten much better over the years however."
Strange Horticulture,Red dead 2 is leagues better imo
Strange Horticulture,Rdr2 is probably the best story in a game I have ever played. Full stop. It is genuinely one of the most amazing game stories there is. I would recommend it over cyberpunk based on that alone
Strange Horticulture,Red Dead 1st by far
Strange Horticulture,"Imo they are both very enjoyable from a story and gameplay angle. Some of it comes to taste (do you want a Wild West game or futuristic urban environment?). In my opinion you can’t go wrong but there is a reason Red Dead 2 is considered one of the greatest single player games of all time. 


Also, if this matters, cyberpunk is a 30-50 hour game if you complete the story and do a lot of side quests. Red dead 2 is more of a 50+ hour kind of game."
Strange Horticulture,RDR2
Strange Horticulture,I would say red dead now and cyberpunk later
Strange Horticulture,"Cause I don't play video games no more
Never play video games
But Red Dead Redemption 2, that is not a game
It's an incredible journey through old American history
Fighting for your life and fighting for your family
Try to live your days with honor and integrity
That's not a game, that's an adult thing
That's not a game at all
That's like fuckin' Shakespeare
- Jack Black"
Strange Horticulture,"Objectively RDR2 is the better game in almost every way, and it’s also cheaper right now. But man I can’t help but absolutely adore cyberpunk, even more than red dead. My brain says get red dead but my heart says get cyberpunk"
Strange Horticulture,"Cyberpunk is pretty cool, but RDR2 is a goddamn masterpiece."
Strange Horticulture,"If you like first person action RPG and sci -fi allot like I do Cyberpunk carried the magic. After the millionth plot twist I gave up on Rdr2, cyberpunk is short sweet and tragic."
Strange Horticulture,I would say get red dead. It honestly looks like the better game out of the two and you can always get a refund if you really don't like it.
Strange Horticulture,"Red dead 2, 100%"
Strange Horticulture,Could not put RDR2 down finished in under a month. Cyberpunk took me at least 4.
Strange Horticulture,99.9% of time my answer to this sub is just r/piratedgames
Strange Horticulture,rdr2 all the way
Strange Horticulture,Red Dead Redemption 2 !
Strange Horticulture,Rdr 2
Strange Horticulture,Both are amazing and should be played but get rdr2 first and wait till the new dlc to get cyberpunk.
Strange Horticulture,"RDR2 is to date the best single game I’ve ever played by far.

It’s a masterpiece."
Strange Horticulture,RDR2. Without a doubt.
Strange Horticulture,RDR2
Strange Horticulture,Do you want rootin tootin cowboy shootin or stressy messy cyborg depressy?
Strange Horticulture,"I love both, but cyberpunk is good and RDR2 is next level amazing."
Strange Horticulture,"In between missions, RDR2 is quite therapeutic to play."
Strange Horticulture,"Late to the party, but would like to share my thoughts:

CP2077 has some fantastic writing and beautiful graphics. That being said, it’s a very shallow game in every other department. Given the world-building, it has amazing potential. If they had just given the game another couple years to incubate, it easily could’ve been one of the greatest action-adventure RPGs of its time. 

RDR2 is, on the other hand, *also* a game that has fantastic writing and beautiful graphics. It is, however, the type of game that *did* get the time it needed to fully flesh out all the other aspects of its gameplay. The result is a highly immersive experience with a lot of replayability and content that can last you hundreds of hours."
Strange Horticulture,"It's not even really a fair comparison. 

RDR2 is a ridiculous rich and developed world with unbelievable detail (sometimes to much) and a story that is extremely engaging. It also has some of the best NPC reactions/interactions and is probably one of the top 3 hunting games in the last decade all rolled into one.

Cyberpunk is a mostly dead world with poor interactivity with npcs, a convoluted story that barely makes sense, and is almost entirely empty. I know I mentioned dead and empty twice but it needed repeating. The game had so much potential it didn't live up to its ridiculous. The games AI is almost as bad as basic vanilla skyrim back in the day. Luckily most of the bugs seem to have been dealt with but the game is still not worth buying in my opinion"
Strange Horticulture,I've played both. They're both pretty good. Rdr2 is the best of the 2.
Strange Horticulture,def red dead!
Strange Horticulture,I have never met someone who didnt like rdr2 but cyberpunk seems to be hit or miss i have friends who love it but i have had no enjoyment playing it at all
Strange Horticulture,"Cyberpunk is one of my all-time favourites, but Red Dead II is objectively the GOAT"
Strange Horticulture,RDR 2 and don't think twice. Cyberpunk is good but RDR2 is a masterpiece and goated.
Strange Horticulture,"I haven't played Cyberpunk yet, but RDR2 is a must play. I held off on playing RDR2 for a long time, due to people saying its slow paced. That was a mistake. I didn't feel slow to me, because the story is so good. If it was a movie, it would get an Oscar."
Strange Horticulture,Rdr2 first and then cyberpunk
Strange Horticulture,RDR2 no contest
Strange Horticulture,RDR2 is at minimum a top 10 all time must play game
Strange Horticulture,Red dead is wayyyy better than cyber.
Strange Horticulture,"10/10 ""wild west"" (kind of) open world with a 10/10 story or a, well, cyberpunk open world with a 9,5/10 story


your call"
Strange Horticulture,"Rdr2 is amazing. Cyberpunk is great and one of the better open world games I've played ever. I've played a lot of games and I adore this game. Wasn't perfect obviously with the console bugs but it's still great. If you're on pc then get it,next gen consoles then yeah. Previous gen then definitely no. 

After playing both, I can say both are great and damn good games. RDR2 is a masterpiece and Cyberpunk could one day end up being remembered as one. If not for the bugs and launch issues then kt would've been perfect imo"
Strange Horticulture,"Rdr2 is amazing. Cyberpunk is great and one of the better open world games I've played ever. I've played a lot of games and I adore this game. Wasn't perfect obviously with the console bugs but it's still great. If you're on pc then get it,next gen consoles then yeah. Previous gen then definitely no. 

After playing both, I can say both are great and damn good games. RDR2 is a masterpiece and Cyberpunk could one day end up being remembered as one. If not for the bugs and launch issues then kt would've been perfect imo. It got some fair criticism for sure mainly on the bugs but I feel it got too much. Though full disclosure, I didn't even know much of the game til a week before launch"

Strange Horticulture,"Cyberpunk is one of the more fun games I've played in years.  Red dead redemption 2 is the single greatest game I've ever played. Play both, but start with red dead."
Strange Horticulture,How much is rdr2? I just bought it for $70? 😭😭😭😭
Strange Horticulture,Anyone who is a gamer must play RDR2
Strange Horticulture,Cyberpunk. That's just me though. This is really a question you need to ask yourself.
Strange Horticulture,"Well I would say both, but I would suggest leaving cyberpunk aside until Phantom Liberty comes out and you can experience it at its highest. So for now, I recommend Red Dead. It's very fun, finished it recently, couldn't put my controller down, one week of my holiday gone, spent 110 hours on the game. Just don't overwhelm yourself and don't rush too much with the story, just enjoy the game's atmosphere and its randomness and progress in the story in whatever way feels best to you.

If you worry about completionism, I recommend making a manual save for everytime you start a new chapter."
Strange Horticulture,Cyberpunk has finally gotten out of the shadow of its launch and is finally the game it was promised to be. But RDR 2 would be Rockstar’s masterpiece if the first game and GTA V didn’t already exist. Definitely check both games out but give Red Dead Redemption 2 a try first.
Strange Horticulture,I liked Cyberpunk a lot but RDR2 is the way to go
Strange Horticulture,Cyberpunk only because it going to get a overhaul that makes the game worth playing but red dead 2 is hella fun as well so wouldn't blame you if you got that over it since cyberpunk started off bad and kept people off it.
Strange Horticulture,RDR2. It has an amazing story.
Strange Horticulture,I haven't played Cyberpunk but RDR2 is such a masterpiece so that's my vote :)
Strange Horticulture,Red Dead Redemption is a masterpiece. Cyberpunk in its current state is fine but nowhere near RDR2 level.
Strange Horticulture,RDR2
Strange Horticulture,"I played both, and 110% would pick RDR2 over cyberpunk. I think I’ve replayed it 4 times now. Played through Cyberpunk once and haven’t felt much like going back. Just a richer story in RDR2."
Strange Horticulture,"i know everyone and their mom has already said it in this comment section, but i’m gonna add my voice to the choir anyways: rdr2 first, without a doubt."
Strange Horticulture,RDR2 is great. would never spend money on cyberjunk
Strange Horticulture,Rdr2 is slow as fuck cyberpunk is fast paced so i would go for cyberpunk (haven't been a fan of slow paced walking and riding Sims no matter how good the story is if they can't give it to me in a faster manner or keep me retained i ain't bout that)
Strange Horticulture,RDR 2
Strange Horticulture,"Wow, someone needs to rep cyberpunk here.  I loved it.  Best game of last 5 years for me.

Rdr2 was boring for me.  Scenery was pretty and all but I just found it repetitive.  Ride horse, shoot, do boring camp stuff, etc.  I dunno I like doing that stuff in real life.  

Cyberpunk is just super fun.  The soundtrack bangs.. you get swords implanted in your arms... the lore is super interesting.. lots of meaningful choices.  It's the only game I've ever replayed 

CP got a bad rap at launch.  I get it.  But on PS5 today it rocks"
Strange Horticulture,"Cyberpunk will have a GOTY edition either with Phantom Liberty’s release or shortly thereafter. Acquiring RDR2 right now makes more sense, at least to me."
Strange Horticulture,Buy rdr2 and when cyberpunk gets a complete edition buy that one later on
Strange Horticulture,Both are incredible. I would not recommend getting Cyberpunk on a PS4 as it just stops working for me after like an hour of play time. RDR2 is a considerably better game but both are worth it
Strange Horticulture,"Play RDR, then go to the second one - you won't regret it."
Strange Horticulture,"I'm playing Cyberpunk rn and while id say it is a very good game and looks incredible, it is still nowhere near as polished as RDR2, combat, movement, interactions, npcs, customization and most of the things that make an open world/exploration game good are better in RDR2 in my opinion. But id still recommend you to get Cyberpunk later, it is a great game."
Strange Horticulture,"Red dead 2, Cyberpunk isn't bad now, but RDR2 still has a good case for being the best game of all time."
Strange Horticulture,I would get RDR2 first. Its long game with a much better story imo. Plus cyberpunk is getting that expansion in a few months that'll be overhauling some gameplay mechanics.
Strange Horticulture,Cyberpunk.
Strange Horticulture,"Red dead’s storymode is god tier, online can be amazing, Cyberpunk is very good, Perosnally I’d say red dead if you’ll play the online, cyberpunk if ur not gonna play the online"
Strange Horticulture,"I say it depends on your system. I have a PS4 slim and cyberpunk is unplayable after the last large update. Gonna have to get a ps5 to actually play it. Could be my save corrupted somehow, but the game freezes after 20 minutes almost religiously."
Strange Horticulture,RDR2 is one the best video games ever made. Definitely go for that first.
Strange Horticulture,RDR2 any day of the week.
Strange Horticulture,"Play RDR2 first and then buy Cyberpunk when the new expansion drops. I love both games, but it sounds like CP2077: Phantom Liberty will be the definitive edition"
Strange Horticulture,"I would recommend both, but you need to play RDR2 if you haven't first"
Strange Horticulture,Red dead redemption 2 a million times over cyberpunk
Strange Horticulture,"RDR2, absolutely."
Strange Horticulture,"I think cyberpunk and the expansion are on sale right now. But I’d go for rdr2 first considering it will be more instant gratification then having to wait till December for the expansion on cyberpunk, which will have a ton of new content meant to make the experience way better."
Strange Horticulture,"Cyberpunk is poorly written, rdr2 is a masterclass"
Strange Horticulture,RDR2 by a mile
Strange Horticulture,"I played both games this year. I haven't finished Cyberpunk yet but it's pretty fun, I love everything about it except for some game breaking bugs and funny braindead AI. Both games are great but RDR2 is a triump; storytelling, characters, sound design, voice acting and impressive life-like world with a lot of details and hidden gems in it although gameplay is your standard Rockstar game, it's still an immersive game."
Strange Horticulture,"I would recommend that you never buy cyberpunk and if Red dead is your thing, go for it. (It’s not my thing. But seriously, don’t buy cyberpunk.)"
Strange Horticulture,Definitely Red Dead Redemption 2. Best game i have ever played since 2006
Strange Horticulture,"huge cyberpunk fan here, i'd probably buy it when phantom liberty comes out since they're overhauling everything. RDR2 however was a masterpiece when it came out. definitely grab it, especially if on sale"
Strange Horticulture,RDR2 will make you question if any game you ever played was good at all.
Strange Horticulture,"Fair warning. I also say RDR2, BUT you need to go into it realizing it IS intentionally slower paced. Take your time with it, really invest in the characters and just hang out in the world, exploring and such. However, that said, I absolutely LOVE RDR2. It’s my favorite of all time."
Strange Horticulture,Rdr2
Strange Horticulture,"Both are really good 

I really enjoyed RDR2 a lot but Cyberpunk has something that really made me love it. 

I don't know if it's the setting or the overall dystopian world but it's a really great experience now

Plus Phantom Liberty is coming in september I believe so it might be worth a try"
Strange Horticulture,"Both are on par and considered masterpieces of their own, CP story is more complex and fast paced while RDR2 is more of a slow burn kind of story. I think that CP is the superior game but I think you should buy both."
Strange Horticulture,"Imo RDR2 is superior in essentially every aspect, I would definitely try it out."
Strange Horticulture,Get both
Strange Horticulture,"Definitely RDR2, seriously it contains the best protagonist you’ll ever play."
Strange Horticulture,"Red dead is a must - cyberpunk is a should, so play RDR 2 first, then when the DLC is out pick up cyberpunk"
Strange Horticulture,RDR2. I played both but for me RDR2 is just better.
Strange Horticulture,"RDR2 barring it’s online is easily one of the best games ever made in my opinion. Same goes for RDR1, which can be played in either order. On top of that there’s undead nightmare as an added plus"
Strange Horticulture,"I love both. But if I had to choose, it would be RDR2"
Strange Horticulture,"Honestly both are really great games, you should pick based on what type of world you would like to dive into. Dystopian future, vs movie western."
Strange Horticulture,Rdr2 killed my parents. We’re happily married now.
Strange Horticulture,"RDR2 for sure!!!! I'm playing it again right now. Easily in my top 10 greatest games of all time. And with the amount of games I've played over 30+ years, that is really saying something."
Strange Horticulture,Honestly they are both amazing In their own rights. RDR2 is considered one of the best games of all time tho so it’s an easy pick
Strange Horticulture,"Obvious answer is rdr 2 first, but let me say this. No open world game will ever be the same after rdr2. Its miles ahead any game ive played to this day, technically and story wise."
Strange Horticulture,"Both games are amazing. You can't go wrong with either - great storyline, great side quests, you can just dig yourself in for hours and hours. I'd highly recommend both. But if I had to pick one, I'd say RDR2. It left a bigger impression on me after finishing it."
Strange Horticulture,"RDR2 is probably the better game from a technical standpoint, but I found the controls kind of kludgy to be honest.  I beat it once and have never felt the desire to replay it.

Cyberpunk on the other hand is the kind of game I can beat then immediately want to start a new character.  Yeah, it's undoubtably not as polished, but I just had more fun with it.  (Again, a big part of this probably just comes back to the controls, which were a lot smoother in Cyberpunk.)

Honestly...  You should just  get them BOTH!"
Strange Horticulture,Rdr2 is easily the greatest console game ever made
Strange Horticulture,"They’re very different games which is something to bare in mind. However, RDR2 is a much more polished product. I’d play that first and then pick up 2077/Phantom Liberty because they have basically said that the entire game is getting overhauled and polished with the next update/DLC in September. Both games will grip you emotionally as they’re very well written"
Strange Horticulture,I played through cyberpunk twice. I stopped playing RDR2 when I got bored of riding my horsey.
Strange Horticulture,Cyberpunk. Honestly RDR2 kind of bored me
Strange Horticulture,And I will play it. Thanks for the reply.
Strange Horticulture,Yeah what else is there to say? Although Cyberpunk is very enjoyable
Strange Horticulture,I would say portal is a triumph.
Strange Horticulture,"Sure, I guess then RDR2 it is. Thanks for the reply."
Strange Horticulture,I won't pass on either but I guess first I will go through RDR2. Thanks for the reply.
Strange Horticulture,I didn't feel the same. What is so unmissable about red dead for you?
Strange Horticulture,To be honest it really depends. Personally I felt Red dead was a little to realistic for me and Cyber punk was more actiony.
Strange Horticulture,">It will give you a thrill, make you feel like a badass, and then leave you in tears.

beautifully said."
Strange Horticulture,Yes.
Strange Horticulture,Same here it's hard to get into other games since I've played rdr2 I keep going back to it.
Strange Horticulture,"Yeah, I guess waiting for the new update and dlc is the best option as new things will be added along with overhauls. Thanks for the reply."
Strange Horticulture,What kind of depth does rdr2 have?
Strange Horticulture,"Yeah. I just saw the dlc as pre-order along with Cyberpunk, but I think it will not be a great idea to buy it as they are adding and overhauling some features of the game in the next update probably. I guess waiting atleast till the update will be the right choice. Thanks for the reply."
Strange Horticulture,I’ve just started the game is it best to wait for the DLC then and when does it drop ?
Strange Horticulture,Phantom Pain is Metal Gear Solid. Cyberpunk 2077's expansion is called Phantom Liberty.
Strange Horticulture,Do you know if ultimate version of RDR2 is worth it?
Strange Horticulture,Any other game similar to rdr2 in gameplay? I love the sort of chill vibes with the option of action.
Strange Horticulture,Careful it's CP2077
Strange Horticulture,"Just a minor note that the outfit issue was fixed with a transmog function, so now you can play dress up and not just worry about stats.  But if you want to see your own outfit you have to drive a motorcycle."
Strange Horticulture,Should I finish cyberpunk before the dlc?
Strange Horticulture,"Yeah same here, RDR2 was amazing but I was way more immersed in Cyberpunk's world than RDR2's one 

Though both are really great games and should be played imo"
Strange Horticulture,"Sorry to bother, but I would also like to ask which edition of RDR2 should I get. I will tell beforehand that I don't think I will be playing online version of the game."
Strange Horticulture,I think most people agree that RDR2’s story is great and the strongest part of the game besides the visuals.
Strange Horticulture,"Bruh. Who has the audacity to say RDR2 doesn’t have a good story?

It’s been widely, widely lauded as having one of the best stories in recent years"
Strange Horticulture,"Thanks. I think story is subjective so might really like RDR2 too as I am not a huge fan of futuristic world. Though I am not a huge fan of Cowboys either (mediaeval fan here), though I might like it if I play it. Thanks for replying, I might get RDR2 now and wait for the update and expansion of Cyberpunk."
Strange Horticulture,"I don't know about the story, but the best video game character is BT-7274. Period."
Strange Horticulture,"This is how I feel. Cyberpunk was faster paced and I got more immediate gratification. I actually still haven’t gotten very far in RDR2 just because it has been slower-paced, but that being said, it is an exceptionally well-designed game"
Strange Horticulture,"You’ve just described my exact experience. I really enjoyed RDR2 but we had just had our first baby when the it released - I just didn’t have the time and it fell by the wayside as a result, so I never finished it. Cyberpunk I managed to complete several times over on PS4 Pro and one more on PS5. Every single play through I’ve played completely differently to the last. It’s been immense. The sheer variety on offer with the story and the play styles means totally different experiences each time. While Red Dead is a beautiful and epic experience - it’s a fairly unilateral one. The only real variety coming from how many side missions or how much peripheral content you want to pursue. My wife played Cyberpunk more than I did - her sessions were vastly different to mine. I haven’t seen anything quite like it since the likes of Elder Scrolls."
Strange Horticulture,“HANK! DON’T ABBREVIATE CYBERPUNK LIKE THAT! HAAAAANK!”
Strange Horticulture,Not really. Where is the single player content?
Strange Horticulture,"Same is experience. RDR2 more polished and you interact with more things, and NPC has better reactions. But cyberpunk is just more fun to play.

My biggest issue with rockstar games is that on rails and very linear. That’s being said they still quality games and will buying the next Rockstar game when it comes out."
Strange Horticulture,You can always turn off aim assist for a better challenge in RDR2
Strange Horticulture,What do you mean by terrible gameplay in RDR2?
Strange Horticulture,"Yeah, just saw the amount of things they are adding in the update and expansion. Some of it is overhaul of current systems so I guess waiting for the update and the dlc is the best thing for now. Anyways, I would like to ask one more thing, should I buy RDR2 on Epic store or Steam because as far as I have heard, Epic store has a really bad mod support for games. And I guess there some fine mods for RDR2 so would like to get my hands on them. Thanks."
Strange Horticulture,"> game i *paid* for. So

FTFY.

Although *payed* exists (the reason why autocorrection didn't help you), it is only correct in:

 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

 * *Payed out* when letting strings, cables or ropes out, by slacking them. *The rope is payed out! You can pull now.*

Unfortunately, I was unable to find nautical or rope-related words in your comment.

*Beep, boop, I'm a bot*"
Strange Horticulture,"I played the game about a year ago and only experienced like 5 bugs, none of them even being close to game breaking"
Strange Horticulture,I bought and played a month or so ago and experienced almost 0 bugs. I think one quest messed up and that was it. After the most recent patch it seems pretty good. Also looks amazing with the ray tracing.
Strange Horticulture,">the janky controls are super frustrating and honestly it’s pretty slow at times. I don’t need to watch long animations every time I pick something up or do anything. It’s more cowboy sim than game.  
>  
>Tried it 3 times and never make it past 10 hrs or so.

Not every game is made for you."
Strange Horticulture,you think cyberpunk is a fail because of first week youtube videos and headlines. mostly everyone that plays the game says it is on track to becoming a no man's sky type revive
Strange Horticulture,Cyberpunk absolutely does not have better writing…
Strange Horticulture,no reason to skip one of the greatest games of this generation
Strange Horticulture,"How is it overrated, there’s no game that has that level of detail, i can understand not enjoying the slow paced gameplay, but you can’t deny that no game has pushed the boundaries of open world like red dead in terms of immersion."
Strange Horticulture,sure buddy go play ludo
Strange Horticulture,You're getting hate but it's true. RD2 felt more like an interactive movie than a game.
Strange Horticulture,"For reference, I have played both and love both, I even lean towards rdr2, but I am recommending based on OP's interests, unlike most of you"

Strange Horticulture,I’ll be honest I thought RDR2 was a tedious piece of trash and nothing like the first game. Cyberpunk   Is more fun and you’ll want to play it more.
Strange Horticulture,"Cyberpunk is getting a big expansion in September, along with a huge update that overhauls the whole game pretty much. Definitely hit RDR first and then grab cyberpunk after the update sometime."
Strange Horticulture,Great story.  Great gameplay.  Great experience overall.
Strange Horticulture,"I think it has some serious flaws but most of those flaws are in line with the vision of the game rather than being oversights. Like all the animations and forced walk sections, or the controls not being very arcadey with no jump button. The main flaw that defies this rule is the absurdly on-the-rails quests, which are typical for Rockstar.

All of that being said, it was in many ways a masterwork. Unparalleled attention to detail. Felt great to explore and discover. Could sink absurd hours into it or just pick up and play, and either way is fun. I find myself coming back to it all the time and finding things I missed.

It was imo the first Open World to feature both breadth and depth in world design without being riddled with bugs. You can tell the crunch went into perfecting the details rather than throwing the game together.

Gameplay and story not revolutionary but consistently solid."
Strange Horticulture,It’s an absolute masterpiece.
Strange Horticulture,"I've played and beaten both, and I love both games. That being said RDR2 is a fucking masterpiece. I don't know any game I'd pick over rdr2 in a one on one."
Strange Horticulture,"It's probably the deepest and most fully realized open world ever crafted, filled with rich and compelling characters, emergent choices, and awesome things to discover. It's held up by many experts as one of the iconic examples of video games as art. But go off, chief. Contrarianism is all the rage."
Strange Horticulture,"It would be easier to list what components of RDR2 *do not* have depth:

Enemies - it's all pew pew guys across the board.

Mounts - it's all horses across the board.

As for narrative, gameplay, world building, world interaction, customization, side missions, character developments, npc interactions, etc. etc. etc., I could go on but I've given your clearly catty, insincere comment enough effort and time, maybe just become more interesting in the future and open up with a compelling point next time."
Strange Horticulture,September 26.
Strange Horticulture,Haha very true that was a Freudian slip!
Strange Horticulture,"If you can get it cheap then maybe but I don't think it's worth it, personally."
Strange Horticulture,Rdr1 is the only one I can think of
Strange Horticulture,GTA
Strange Horticulture,Death Stranding I suppose both tedious games but are top 3 for me
Strange Horticulture,Oh that’s good to know. And thanks for the correction
Strange Horticulture,No they plan to overhaul the ai and make other changes. (Better Skill tree for example)
Strange Horticulture,"In which case, the cheapest version. The ultimate edition just has online content iirc"
Strange Horticulture,"Is the story really good or are the characters just carrying everything? Playing rn and the story is kind of meh. Rockstar games never really had a great main story, but that is not necessary with all the fun.

Not saying I'm right, just how I am feeling right now."
Strange Horticulture,[deleted]
Strange Horticulture,"Many actually. And even as a huge fan myself, I understand that the pacing of that story is all over the place and many of my friends drop it after initial 2-3 snowy hours and I keep on trying to convince them."
Strange Horticulture,"When I was contemplating rdr2 I felt like you. I also was unsure about the horse riding mechanic, as I was used to GTA and using vehicles. And I was unsure I would enjoy the 1899 setting. But let me tell you, get this game! It’s so good. You will end up being fascinated with the world, including the horse riding."
Strange Horticulture,"I've tried to get into RDR2 multiple times, I really appreciate the quality and complexity of the game, but I just can't, because I find the entire cowboy setting to be boring and uninteresting."
Strange Horticulture,"The game was so good and complete at release, it didn’t need it."
Strange Horticulture,"There's a reason why they made auto aim the default in RDR2, because the combat is so clunky that it needs it"
Strange Horticulture,It’s a very boring gameplay that’s for sure.
Strange Horticulture,Mainly because the mission design and combat are so bad
Strange Horticulture,"I play on PS5, so I wouldn't know much about epic store vs steam. Maybe try asking on the Red Dead sub, they will probably give better answers than I could"
Strange Horticulture,You can mod pretty much everygame on steam just as well if not better than epic. Some games even have steam cumunity mods through the steam store such as l4d2. Really the only reason id choose epic over steam for anything is if epic is giving a game away for free and even them there are some cases where id still just rather buy it from steam.
Strange Horticulture,Good bot
Strange Horticulture,The freind i borrowed it from said the same thing so i guess it varied from person to person. My experience was a mess. Nothing game breaking in the sense that i couldn't progress but a lot of religing becouse i got stuck in terminals and uis. Also had this one where jackie always had his gun out no matter what animtion he was doing or where he was. Even had it on that mission where we coukdnt bring our guns. Nothing could have been done to fix that one just had to accept that that was jakie now for that playthrough
Strange Horticulture,"Im with this guy, never had any game breaking bugs in this game from day 1. Playing PC with a good gpu over on my end tho. If youve got a 30 series gpu or newer cyberpunk runs literally fine"
Strange Horticulture,Yeah thats one thing i can personally attest to it looks really good. Also it supports dlss 3 fram generation so it runs really smooth a 4000 series card.
Strange Horticulture,"This is a stupid fucking reply

Nowhere did they say that. They're allowed to criticise the controls of a game when someone asks for opinions on that game. Opinions from both sides are important when deciding whether to buy something or not."
Strange Horticulture,Never said it was.
Strange Horticulture,It's widely agreed the controls and combat are super clunky.
Strange Horticulture,"Opinions are opinions my dude, both games had amazing writing but I felt more connected to Cyberpunk."
Strange Horticulture,Guess the opinions are divided. I didn't like rdr2's writing very much. What was so great about it then?
Strange Horticulture,I agree about the level of detail. For sure it's impressive in that aspect. It's just soooo fucking slooow man. I almost didn't finish that game considering how tedious it was. I'm sorry.
Strange Horticulture,Ok
Strange Horticulture,"Tedious as f... imo. I almost didn't finish it, but the story got me through. Gameplay was the worst!"
Strange Horticulture,"Weird, I was raised by fast paced shooters and such and absolutely adored rdr2 despite its slower nature."
Strange Horticulture,"Want to cook some food? 10 minute animation per piece cooked. Want to loot something? 10 minute animation of you picking the body up. Want to skin an animal? 45 minute animation. Oh, and btw, you need hundreds of pelts if you want to do side content. It is the most ridiculous shit.

Everyone kept telling me I needed to get to chapter 2 to really get a feel for the game. I made it past chapter 2 and I still hate the game. Only now I'm past my refund window and hate it even more now.

Every mission is you riding with some member of your crew on horseback for 45 minutes while you get gigantic exposition dumps. RDR2 is the game you get when you distill the WORST parts of the GTA franchise down into a cowboy game.

This was the first game that was universally praised, in a genre I love, that I hated to it's core. It has me questioning whether or not i should even bother buying the last of us on PC."
Strange Horticulture,Where are details on the huge update? Can’t seem to find any but very interested
Strange Horticulture,Still playing cyberpunk on a console like ps5 is like playing in a ghost town. If OP has a decent rig he should definitely hit cyberpunk in September.
Strange Horticulture,"Wasn't this supposed to come out this month? I am very excited about the DLC, but I'll believe the release date once I've downloaded it."
Strange Horticulture,"Will they completely drop their sad excuse for an armor system, their sad excuse for a weapon system, and their sad excuse for a perk system? Oh wait… that’s like every system in the damn game. Would be silly to ask for that.

Edit: holy shit it looks like they are!"
Strange Horticulture,"I thought it was very visually impressive and well acted. Also the soundtrack fucking slaps. I love the soundtrack. It also usually managed to capture the intended vibe very well. But it wasn't very thought-provoking. And some of the side content just completely misses the mark. 

Cyberpunk is a lot less polished and pleasant. But some of the sidequests could have carried entire high-quality indiegames."
Strange Horticulture,"Trailing missions, long ass point a to point b travel, goofy ah shooting, extremely linear missions, breaking the games economy with that stage coach robbery mission. Can’t deny the flaws."
Strange Horticulture,Did not know a simple question was a clearly catty insincere comment....
Strange Horticulture,"Lol what a pathetically insecure reply. RDR2 has absolutely zero depth when it comes to gameplay, mission structure, level design, or npc interactions. It’s all shallow set dressing for a pretty decent story that would’ve worked better as a TV series. As an actual videogame, it’s average at best."
Strange Horticulture,"> I've given your clearly catty, insincere comment enough effort and time, maybe just become more interesting in the future and open up with a compelling point next time.

You’re right - how dare he ask a simple question about your favourite game?! The audacity of /u/ihave0idea0 knows no limits! 

Personally I find RDR2 wholly unappealing to me, mostly because what I’ve seen of the combat mechanics seems quite repetitive and more importantly not skill-based.  
But I also don’t like the Elder Scrolls series or Cyberpunk for the same reason, so this thread just isn’t for me."
Strange Horticulture,"Yeah, been through that. And online doesn't do it for me"
Strange Horticulture,I actually have that. Might give it a try
Strange Horticulture,Oh I’ll wait then damn okay thanks.
Strange Horticulture,Thank you very much.
Strange Horticulture,"It’s definitely more character driven than plot driven. It might take a while for the story to get going, but when it does, it’s really some of the best dramatic writing I’ve ever seen in anything. It’s worth sticking with for sure."
Strange Horticulture,"… that’s what a story is, a journey of characters through an arc. The plot of 99% of stories is the same basic shit."
Strange Horticulture,"Fair, I can’t seem to get into Witcher 3, despite being a huge fan of the lore and gameplay.

It just… feels so huge and cumbersome"
Strange Horticulture,Yeah the story feels very disjointed. You do like 5 completely unrelated main story missions and then eventually come across another mission that advances the story. How’s that a great story? I get that people like those unrelated main missions since they like long games and are willing to tolerate a somewhat disjointed story if it means a longer game. But you can’t tell me that’s a good story. A good story must have a good flow.
Strange Horticulture,Rdr2 is easily top 5 of last gen
Strange Horticulture,"Yeah it's not even gameplay.
Just high quality movie"
Strange Horticulture,Tried that but didn't get any answer. Other modding subreddits had no idea either. I guess I will try asking there again. Thank you very much.
Strange Horticulture,"Actually had a coupon on epic store, so wouldn't want it to go to waste. I have some other the list but would live to know if epic store version can be modded. The RDR2 subreddit seems kinda dead with most of the posts with no replies so I think I might not get one there either."
Strange Horticulture,Best bot
Strange Horticulture,">This is a stupid fucking reply

Exactly my thoughts lol.

I absolutely loved RDR2 but I can totally see how it can be boring for some people. In fact, I've seen plenty of comments on various subs saying exactly that, so I think it's important thing to highlight for OP."
Strange Horticulture,"It was cool at first but then I just got tired of it quick. I also work 50hrs a week with like 1 hour commute one way so I just don’t have time for slow games anymore. 
That being said getting off a horse just to pick something up every time is just an awful game play design."
Strange Horticulture,What a debby downer you are. Pessimistic much? Lol
Strange Horticulture,Valid
Strange Horticulture,"[Check it](https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/147domj/everything_new_with_phantom_liberty_and_patch_17/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)

I’m pretty excited"
Strange Horticulture,It says September 26th on steam. Even if you don't get the DLC you still get access to the massive overhaul btw.
Strange Horticulture,I think the side content is amazing. Maybe some things could be better but it is very good
Strange Horticulture,"Yeah I get that but thought provoking is not what I expect from Rockstar, or any game outside of select RPGs.

It’s more like a great execution of a tried and true formula. If I wanted a thought provoking Western, I’d reread Blood Meridian, not play an open world game."
Strange Horticulture,There’s nothing thought provoking about Cyperpunk either
Strange Horticulture,They’re not flaws…  They’re features!
Strange Horticulture,Yeah rockstar hasn't improved it's gameplay since GTA San Andreas. It's a shame because visually and story wise the games are brilliant
Strange Horticulture,"It's not a simple question, it's probably the most highly praised game of the last decade, pretending that you know nothing about it whatsoever and have decided to randomly come to me to learn more about it is naive and stupid at best."
Strange Horticulture,"And this is the kind of dumbass mentality that went behind asking 'hurr, what kind of depth rdr2 got?'"
Strange Horticulture,"The OP asked which game should he play, not your emotional personal take that doesn’t help at all and literally NO ONE cares about"
Strange Horticulture,I hear you. Just the most similar gameplay I could think of. Basically the same game at a different time period with different technology.
Strange Horticulture,"Story wise, propably. Gameplay, definetly not."
Strange Horticulture,I dont see why not you wouldnt be able too. Modding alters your local files on your system so i feel like whichever store front you bought it from wouldnt matter. All the games ive ever modded were on steam but i never had to actually interact with steam to do it so i feel like the same processes would have worked even if i bought them from epic.
Strange Horticulture,"Fair enough, that horse thing is true"
Strange Horticulture,"Everyone I know loves this game. So I never criticize it around them, because I would feel like a debbie downer. It was just exciting to finally see someone else hate it."
Strange Horticulture,Everything he said is valid and he’s entitled to his opinion. That isn’t pessimism
Strange Horticulture,"The shredder of panda guy I’m replying to blocked  me, then reported me to Reddit for some kinda wellness check?? People are so weird.. wtf"
Strange Horticulture,"Thank you. 

Man I am hype now."
Strange Horticulture,I'm happy for you. That I didn't feel the same doesn't mean I want to take that away from you
Strange Horticulture,"I don't think thought provoking was something they were not trying to do. The story of the main characters in what is essentially a cult was compelling but just not for that long. 

Also looking at cyberpunk again. I think there are plenty of moments there that could be labeled thought provoking. 

Maybe I just wanted the wrong things from the game."
Strange Horticulture,"No? What about Joshua's quest line? Rivers quest line? The quests with the mayor and his wife? V's story, the different endings. Even the quest with the vending machine ends up asking some interesting questions."
Strange Horticulture,Let’s hope for gta 6 I personally didn’t like rdr2 as much as other people did for personal reasons but I still thought it was a fantastic game
Strange Horticulture,"Damn, you even double-downed on it.

People ARE allowed to not know everything about RDR2, man.

You clearly spend a lot of time thinking about your favourite video games - that’s fine, but you should realise that other people may have other interests and may actually not know much about it, if at all.

As I said I personally find the gameplay uninteresting (not sure how you can think it has a lot of depth, tbh) - and a game without good gameplay is just a bad game to me. Therefore I have little interest in Rockstar games in general, because their gameplay is usually super casual-oriented.

As for the rest of you description of the depth of the game, you used a bunch of buzz-words but didn’t actually explaining anything to the guy.

Good graphics, good story, world building, character development and voice acting are great, but if that’s all there is to it, I’d rather watch a movie or read a book tbh. Gameplay is where games are at for me, and a lot of people in general."
Strange Horticulture,"Did you mean to reply to someone else?

How am I the emotional one for replying to someone having a complete meltdown at the mère idea that someone didn’t know the alleged qualities of RDR2?

I explained why I thought that neither games thought of by OP were particularly good in my opinion. That’s very relevant to the discussion.

What’s the point of your needlessly aggressive comment that no one asked for and no one cares about, to use your own words?"
Strange Horticulture,Exactly. However I think my emotional investment was larger in rdr2. But time period doesn't really matter.
Strange Horticulture,"Thanks for the reply. Just wanted to make sure. Actually, I heard and experienced issues with modding, especially with Bethesda games in Epic Games Store. And in general have heard people saying that Epic store is pretty bad if someone wants to play with mods. Modding for me is one of the main and most fun things (especially in games like Skyrim) so sometimes no excess to mods can be a huge deal breaker for me."
Strange Horticulture,"""10 minute animation. 45 minute animation"". Yeah sure  that's real valid isn't it lol. Someone being overly negative and blowing something out of proportion is considered to be pessimistic to me. I never said he was wrong and couldn't have an opinion. I just called him a debby downer. I'm entitled to my opinion as well right?"
Strange Horticulture,"Hey, what didn’t you like about the side content? I guess hunting is kinda barebones"
Strange Horticulture,"Rivers quest was so boring. Go here, fetch this. Fetch that. Search the nephews room for clues. Snooze fest. It was nothing I haven’t seen before a million times. Most of the side quests were boring as hell. There were some cool moments, but thought provoking? Nah."
Strange Horticulture,"Don't care, didn't read; get more interesting and stop leaning on sarcasm as a crutch for your lack of personality."
Strange Horticulture,Continue with your non contributions. Op asked which game and here you are just wasting thread space
Strange Horticulture,If you want to rant about how terrible RDR2 is make your own post
Strange Horticulture,"Your making comments on someone’s character over a game, if anything you’re a Debby downer"
Strange Horticulture,"Some of the sidequests were kinda stupid and unsatisfying. The one that stuck in my mind the most was the one where you encounter that woman who takes advantage of two guys with disabilities and the ark of the story is that the guys don't want to be with her because she's an absolutely horrible, abusive human being. Then when you find them they realise that they're still gonna go with her. 

Like what's the point? I had no input, the ark of the characters was to learn to put up with an abuser and it took like 20 minutes. 

&#x200B;

Not to say that I encountered no good sidequests. The one where you help a woman learn to live in the forest was lovely. But the game to me was littered with moments that ended in an unsatisfying anticlimax."
Strange Horticulture,"Very interesting. What did you think of >!
Jackies funeral? !<"
Strange Horticulture,"That comes from the guy that screeched and had a complete meltdown when someone else dared ask which kind of depth RDR2 had, because how dare he not know your favourite video game.

There is 0 irony in my last comment, btw! Not that I would expect you to understand irony…

Lmfao, reddit basement-dweller moment."
Strange Horticulture,"What’s YOUR contribution, lad? What’s your purpose? Why are you commenting?

As I said above, I explained why I thought neither of the games were particularly good in my opinion. That’s highly relèvent on a sub where people ask whether they should buy specific games.

My comment is on topic. Yours aren’t and are just useless attacks with 0 contribution on the actual subject. Are you perhaps an alt of the other guy? That’s the o my way this would make sense, tbh. You’re weird"
Strange Horticulture,"Ranting? For a whole 2 lines? Do you even know what a rant is? Open a dictionary ffs

The guy above had a meltdown when someone asked a simple question, I pointed out to him that no everyone necessarily liked every game or knew everything about every game.

That’s highly relevant to the conversation.

Once again, what is YOUR contribution here, apart from attacking me for no reason?"
Strange Horticulture,You're making comments about my character over a reddit post. A bit hypocritical.
Strange Horticulture,"Well, I didn't realize they had disabilities. Maybe I'm just stupid. I'm guessing your talking about the one where you had to keep punching and kicking those guys to prove which one was stronger? 

I saw it as funny, and I never saw them go back to her, I don't think I ever saw them after their final mission.  


Maybe I just didn't find them or I'm stupid. Oh well, I enjoyed those missions, and yeah that one with charlotte (woman in forest) was great."
Strange Horticulture,Getting his bike was the best part
Strange Horticulture,"No, you were in fact, weird because no one cares what you don’t like. I was genuinely interested in seeing how much people loved one game over the other but here you are."
Strange Horticulture,I already gave my contribution
Strange Horticulture,"My contribution was that I love both games but I feel like RDR two gets the one here because not only is it one of the greatest games of all time, but the story is pretty impactful"
Strange Horticulture,My context might seem illiterate because I am using voice to text
Strange Horticulture,"I think we're talking about another quest.  I googled it, it's called ""the smell of grease paint""."
Strange Horticulture,"Intruiging. I absolutely love that quest for how real it feels. 
>! How it takes the time to mourn and speak to the people that this affected. Presenting a death so realistically gave so much validity to the rest of the world. It made me remember times I've lost people. 
Death in video games is never presented like this. !<"
Strange Horticulture,"That sounds like a you issue, tbh

- Some people love one game more than the other

- some people prefer the other one

- some people like neither of them

These are all valid opinions on the exact same subject. I’m in the third camp, for reasons that I explained. I would therefore recommend OP to buy neither of these games if the reasons I gave resonate with him.

It’s hilarious that you don’t see that my comment is very much on topic for this thread - logic isn’t your forte, huh"
Strange Horticulture,"Clearly not in this chain of comment, which is why I’m asking you what you’re even doing here."
Strange Horticulture,"Fair enough! That’s understandable.

My contribution was that I didn’t like either of them for the reason stated above (gameplay isn’t interesting or skill-based enough, and that’s what matters most in games in my opinion), and therefore wouldn’t recommend either of them.

Don’t you see how my opinion is just as valid as yours? Again, why are you commenting here?"
Thumper,Thumper isn't your typical music rhythm game. It's more of a fever dream experience. It's definitely cool experience and something worth experiencing when the price is right for you. It just isn't the same as something like Beat Saber. If you watch some trailers for Thumper you can get an idea of exactly what the gameplay is.
Thumper,alright then. definitely will put it higher on my game wishlist. thanks
Eastward,"I'd say Switch. It's currently locked to 60 fps and 1080p anyway, so a bigger screen won't make it much better and higher frames aren't possible anyway."
Eastward,Eastward looks like a blast! How are you enjoying it?
Eastward,"I'll be honest, it didn't get me hooked as much as I expected, but what keeps me going are the artstyle and the soundtrack. 

There are quite some stretches of long dialogs inbetween dungeons and the combat has been pretty simple so far ( I'm only 3 hours in so far), so don't expect the most action packed Zelda-like game and you most likely won't be disappointed.

If you just want to sit back and chill, it's a great game. Quite a few of secrets rooms and all, but as I said I haven't seen much yet and have no idea if it maybe pops off later on once you unlocked actual weapons and stuff, I still only have the pan you start with and just unlocked the little girl's first ability."
Eastward,Interesting. I was never a 2D Zelda player (just wasnt what I was playing in the SNES days) but I loved Owlboy a few years back and despite the different medium it seemed similar in the mix of action to story/dialogue and pixel art direction...
Hypnospace Outlaw,"I loved Transistor. It has a very present narrator (also voiced by Logan Cunningham, who you'll know from other Supergiant stuff), but it is a tragic game and might not be your jam if you don't like a lonely-feeling world."
Hypnospace Outlaw,"I only played them on a PC, so I cannot make system specific suggestions.


I haven't played Hypnospace Outlaw yet, but it is on my wishlist. 


Firewatch is a very short game, yet I would highly recommend it. Compare it to buying a ticket to the cinema, if that price is okay for you I think the game will be worth it.


Return of the Obra Dinn is fantastic. I think I finished it in around 12 hours? I don't know if you consider that long or short, but to me it was well worth the price. The tone is, hm, tense initially, but you will never be able to get hurt or die, so eventually the edge is gone.

Have you ever watched a video of say an autopsy or disection on Discovery or whatever? Like, you are definitely interested in watching the program, but there is also slight apprehension. Perhaps the first cut and some air blows out startling you or some chunks unexpectedly leave the body in a way you did not expect. So, initially you might be a bit grossed out and/or on edge, but you are very interested so you continue watching. Then at the turning point the blood and gore and chunks stop bothering you and you watch on fascinated by the experts handling the operation and showing and explaning to the camera whatever they are doing etc. Obra is kinda like that, but in black and white stills. At least to me anyway. 


This game really revolves around the details and connections you can make from observations. It can be very hard, especially near the end, but the experience is quite fun if you enjoy this kind of thing. The gameplay can be slow, and of course when you are stuck you might get really stuck for a while, which can be an issue near the end (and honestly, at that point feel no shame using a guide), but overall I would say the game is worth playing through.


I personally didn't really enjoy Transistor, but I haven't played Bastion to compare the gameplay of the two games. The atmosphere is very lonely, and oh shit, what happened here kind of atmosphere, but at the same time very intimate between you and the narrator. There are no NPCs (at least as in so far I played it). I think if you enjoyed the banter between Harry and Kim in Disco Elysium you will also enjoy it in Transistor, though it is one sided and the relationship is more intimate/romantic.


I personally liked the world and loved the graphics, but I did not really care for the gameplay and background lore.


Of the games I played I would not call any of these games a RPG and that all are linear, though in Transistor you do have choices in your powers and such."
Hypnospace Outlaw,I’m okay with lonely-type worlds (I loved Bioshock and that game fees desolate with the lack of friendly NPC’s besides Atlas) as long as there’s one character there with you! Thanks for the recommendation !
Hypnospace Outlaw,"If you end up playing it, I'd be interested to hear your thoughts about it after you're done."
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,"If you liked the newer ac games then ghost of tsushima is a must. Its just that but better combat, prettier and an actual engaging story. Definitely recommend it. Also far cry 6 is just some stupid fun but I'd wait for a lower price in the future."
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,"If you play games like tha new ac titles, which I'm also a fan of, and you also play HZD than it's clearly time you bought yourself HFW. You can finish the first game and it will be so satisfying to be able to pop in the other game right after finishing HZD.

I haven't played Miles Morales, though I got halfway through Spiderman and it is really fun, though it doesn't really offer vibrant and varied places as AC or HZD and HFW.

I also didn't play Far Cry 6 though I've watched videos of it on youtube and it may satisfy the beautiful scenery demand and it is also quite big so you could like it.

I've also heard great thing about Ghost of Tsushima and with the added DLC it should be a great experience, but I'd always chose HZD and HFW for the setting.

I'm currently playing God of War and despite the fact it is so well written and has beautiful graphics, it is not an open world game as AC might be. It is more of a linear story, so it's up to you if you'd like it."
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,"God of war isn't open world, the levels are certainly big and fun but no mean open world which is what you state you enjoy the most, but for 10$ I'd say take the risk and get it, it's considered one of the best games of the last generation and decade, so I'd personally go with that."
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,"If you like Zero Dawn, forbidden west is a must. If you haven't got the the frozen wilds DLC for Zero Dawn, I'd look into that too."
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,god of war isnt necessarily  open world but 10 bucks for it is a steal id recommend it
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,If budget is not an issue why not get PS extra for 25% off? most of games you listed is on the catalog and more will be added in a years time
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,[deleted]
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,"Yes I got it and I‘m looking forward to playing it, thanks for the advice :) 

I‘ve edited the original post in case you’re interested which games I‘ve got out of the sale"
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,"Thanks for the detailed reply! I ended up buying 3 games of the 5 I’ve listed :D 

It was Horizon, Spider-Man and Ghost of Tsushima and I paid 66€ in total because I’ve found a cheaper sale, so basically around the price of one game at standard price. Neat!"
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,"Oh okay, that’s good to know. Thanks! I‘ll still have a look into it, you’re right 10 bucks is definitely a steal"
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,"Yeah I’ve got the DLC, I got HZD for free back in (I guess) 2020 when they had this ""stay home""-campaign and they were giving out a bunch of free Indie games as well as HZD complete edition for a week or so. I downloaded it back then and only now got to play it :D 

But I‘m still not even halfway through the main story and HFW is ""only"" 43% discounted. I thought maybe if I‘m patient it will drop in price even more. Gotta save some money wherever I can lol"
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,"Yeah I thought about that too. I know last year, back when they only had PS Plus (no Extra or Premium) they had an offer around Christmas where it was 50% off for 12 months. Do you think they might do something like that with PS Extra too?"
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,"Yeah I don’t have PS plus because I usually never play online games so it‘s not really worth it for me. I thought about getting PS Extra because there are certainly a lot of great games on it, but it’s still 75 bucks and I‘m not really a big fan of games not really being *mine*, you know what I mean?"
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,You got some great deals! Enjoy those titles while I wait for miles morales and forbidden west to come to pc lol
1979 Revolution: Black Friday,"Thanks, I‘m also very happy about it! :) 

I wish you good luck it’s coming anytime soon, and most of all: patience :D"
Monument Valley,Stardew Valley. I’ve put hundreds of hours into it and I still love it. The subreddit is also really pleasant. I think you’ll really enjoy it :)
Monument Valley,"Thanks to everyone who helped me pick the game, I think I will be able to afford RDR 2 and Stardew Valley for christmas so I will propably buy them both, thanks again."
Monument Valley,"i'd say get stardew valley for now! slime rancher 2 is still in early access and doesn't have a whole ton of content yet (still a fully playable and amazing game don't get me wrong), meanwhile stardew valley can keep you occupied for hundreds of hours and once you run out there's still dozens of super immersive mods to make for a whole new experience."
Monument Valley,"I'd say get RDR while it's on sale, you can always get both SR and SV later, maybe when they are on sale too."
Monument Valley,"Nevermind about red dead redemption 2, my graphic card for sure can't handle it."
Monument Valley,Stardew Valley for sure. I would wait until Slime Rancher 2 is fully finished before jumping into it just for first impression.
Monument Valley,"Stardew easily. I put hundreds of hours in, I would take year breaks and come back like nothing has changed."
Monument Valley,Stardew
Monument Valley,"My only reservation with SDV is if you experience time pressure/anxiety. I only like SDV with mods that let me save at any point (so I can stop playing without losing progress), and slow down the in-game clock by about 50%.

However, if you like Don't Starve, this is likely not an issue for you. I can't stand DS because of the time progression.

RDR2 is great if you are willing to immerse yourself in the RP of being a person living in the west. There are a lot of slow and complete and detailed animations to do pretty much everything. For instance, there are camp chores to do like lugging over hay bales for the horses, or chopping wood. And yes, you really do just pick up the bales of hay and slow walk them over, and walk back (no running in camp). It's amazing if you commit to it, but annoying if you just want constant action at all times."
Monument Valley,SV
Monument Valley,The answer is always Stardew Valley.
Monument Valley,"Stardew is a game that might take you weeks to months to play through far enough that you feel like you've hit everything.

&#x200B;

Slime Rancher 1 and 2 are both very quick games that almost always last at most a week for me.   They are incredible palate cleansers and dopamine fixes.   SR2 is definitely shaping up to be a big improvement over the first."
Monument Valley,"Thank you but I don't think I am much of use here, I didn't play too many games because I can't afford games most of the time, but thank you anyway."
Monument Valley,Honestly I'm so sad that I can't play it just because I don't have money for good hardware.
BattleBlock Theater,"So platform games yeah?

[Life Goes On: Done to Death](http://store.steampowered.com/app/250050/?snr=1_7_7_151_150_1) seems to be her style, from the examples you shared.

[Terraria](http://store.steampowered.com/app/105600/?snr=1_7_7_230_150_1), maybe. It's more... elaborate.

What about the Portal games?"
BattleBlock Theater,You could try Ibb and Obb which is similar to Battle Block  And possible Gang Beasts which is super fun even when you loose. 
BattleBlock Theater,"Speedrunners is fun, but it might be too competitive. "
BattleBlock Theater,Duck Game is quite humorous and has tons of depth to it behind the simple controls. 
BattleBlock Theater,"Have you looked at Ubisoft's current [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com)?

at the 1$ contribution level you can get 3 amazing games, **Call of Juarez: Gunslinger** is probably not up her alley, but **Grow Hom**e is a simplistic cute 3d platformer where you play as an ungainly skinny robot trying to climb shit and plant giant beanstalks.

If she liked Battleblock Theater she would probably really like **Rayman: Origins** too. It's a 2D platformer similar to Battleblock, it starts off pretty simplistic but ramps up the difficulty slowly, but by that time you'll have a good sense of ""flow"" for the game's mechanics. It's fantastic, great soundtrack, character design, style. You can even play co operative too. This game is fantastic, I've beaten it with other casual gamers and they've had a great time with it.


Other than the Humble Bundle there's **Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime** where you play as a couple weird dudes operating a giant spaceship. This is a really fun co op game, basically both players are scrambling around trying to operate controls, guns, shield. Really cute game, lots of fun."
BattleBlock Theater,[deleted]
BattleBlock Theater,"I recommend Chariot for the both of you (do you have 2 controllers?). Other than that I can recommend playing singleplayer games that you can work together to solve like Legend of Grimrock 2, Fran bow and The Secret of Monkey Island. 

Otherwise than those I've enjoyed playing Terraria, Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light, Crypt of the NecroDancer, and The binding of isaac rebirth, with my girlfriend. These last ones might work but are less likely to work if she likes very casual games where there aren't many things to consider."
BattleBlock Theater,Rayman Legends/Origins or Oozi Earth Adventure
BattleBlock Theater,"Great suggestons, Just got Life goes after having a look.

Thanks!"
BattleBlock Theater,"Thank you, I will have a look.
Gang beast looks like fun. Hope it will be completed soon. :)"
BattleBlock Theater,Will give it a go. Who knows...  Thank you!
BattleBlock Theater,Thank you! Looks like a funny game. :)
BattleBlock Theater,"Will check these, thank you for your suggestion! :)
Lovers in spacetime looks right up our alley."
BattleBlock Theater,"Great suggestions, I think these are the right things for her. Just had a look. Thanks!!"
BattleBlock Theater,"Chariot looks great.
I think I'll be getting that one too :)"
BattleBlock Theater,"Just got Oozi earth based on your suggestion. Thanks!
"
BattleBlock Theater,Glad I could help.
BattleBlock Theater,"Duck Game is great.

How great? That really depends on several factors. If I was comparing this with anything else, it would be asking if you like Super Smash Brothers. Super Smash Brothers, in my opinion is only 5/10 if you’re by yourself, but a solid 10/10 when you get a couple guys to play with. Duck Game fares similarly, being a competitive, 2D, PVP focused game with skill based platforming and reaction time. The difference is that Duck Game has the one hit kill intensity found in Samurai Gunn. The kicker is that you can’t attack if you don’t have a weapon, so the start of the match is just a rapid scrambling for firearms and panicked firing. It’s an intense, skill based shootout that I hope to be playing for the next 10 years at least.

Duck Game’s true greatness is its subtleties present in its design. At first it may seem constraining to not be able to aim in all directions like you would expect, but you eventually find that if you’re pressed up against an object your duck aims upward, still allowing you to fire. A particular gun that looks like a giant magnum recoils with each shot, letting you aim slightly higher to hit enemies, essentially you exploit a handling characteristic of the weapon into a game mechanic. The ducks can even float around on stubby wings and slide on their knees if you duck while running (ha ha), allowing you to do Matrix-like dodges against your enemies. Really great stuff, with a high skill ceiling but still easy enough to allow new players to get the drop on more experienced ones, which is the “sweet spot” I adore in competitive games. There’s a button completed dedicated to quacking (SERIOUSLY) which adds a layer of absurdity and humor to the already ridiculous setting that Duck Game takes place in. 

One fear I have is the staying power of the online community. Too many indie games, have I bought on a super-sale only to see that the fan base has since moved on to other games. Duck Game is still relatively new as of 6/22/2015, so finding a game isn’t too difficult, but I really, really REALLY hope this game has longevity in the future. Like I said, 10 years please. One of the upsides this game has over Samurai Gunn is its near perfect online gameplay, which I hope keeps the game alive. I only had a couple of disconnects but the lag never really messed with me too bad. Even if the online dies out, with the local play, all it requires really is a couple of controllers and a few brewskies to have a great time. I love this game."
BattleBlock Theater,"Yay. As a pure platformer, it feels pretty good!"
BattleBlock Theater,"> There’s a button completed dedicated to quacking

What really blew my mind was that the left trigger controls the pitch of the quack."
